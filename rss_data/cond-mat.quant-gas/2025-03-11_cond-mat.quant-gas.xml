      <title>Self-bound dipolar quantum droplets in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-bound dipolar quantum droplet modulated by an shallow optical latticeare studied. It is found that the behaviors of the droplets in an optical lattice are similar with those without the
  optical lattice. In the shallow enough limit the properties of the periodically-modulated dipolar droplets are exactly the same with those without the optical lattice,which are self-bound for the
  absence of any trap in the polarization direction. So we conclude that the formation of droplets in an shallow optical lattice is the competition of atomici nteractions and the quantum
  fluctuations.The optical lattice can only modulate the droplets. Our model can also describe the finite-size dipolar droplet system.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermal Distributions in Integrable Classical and Quantum Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional, integrable many-body classical and quantum systems in thermal equilibrium. In the classical case, we use the classical limit of the Bethe equations to obtain a self-consistent integral equation whose solution gives the distribution of asymptotic Bethe momenta, or rapidities, as well as the classical partition function in the canonical ensemble, and the thermal energy dispersion. For quantum gases, we obtain a similar integral equation, albeit in the grand canonical ensemble, with completely analogous results. We apply our theory to the classical and quantum Tonks and Calogero-Sutherland models, and our results are in perfect agreement with standard calculations using Yang-Yang thermodynamics. Remarkably, we show in a straightforward manner that the thermodynamics of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland model is in one-to-one correspondence with the ideal Fermi gas upon simple rescalings of chemical potential and density.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the inner crust of neutron stars within the superfluid band theory: Competition between $^1\text{S}_0$ pairing and spin polarization under finite temperature and magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions of matter under changes of external environment such as temperature and magnetic field have attracted great interests to various quantum many-body systems. Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\sim10^{16}\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd-parity pairings offer a natural pathway for realizing topological superconductivity. When two identical even-parity superconductors form a $\pi$-junction, the metallic material sandwiched between them experiences an effective odd-parity pairing, facilitating the emergence of topological superconductivity in the intermediate region. In this work, we consider the intermediate material to be a two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Dirac semimetal. When the two superconductors are conventional s-wave superconductors, we find that a helical topological superconductor can be realized. This phase is characterized by the presence of a pair of helical Majorana edge states. Interestingly, when the superconductors are $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductors, we observe not only the helical topological superconductor but also an unconventional topological superconductor. The latter is distinguished by the existence of two pairs of helical Majorana edge states, despite the fact that the global topological invariants for this system take on trivial values. By further applying an in-plane magnetic field, we demonstrate that second-order topological superconducting phases can be achieved. These phases host isolated Majorana corner modes as well as twofold Majorana corner modes. Our findings reveal that two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals can support a rich variety of topological superconducting phases, offering a versatile platform for exploring exotic topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quartet correlations near the surface of $ N = Z $ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Cooper quartet correlations in $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nuclei ($ {}^{40} \mathrm{Ca} $, $ {}^{100} \mathrm{Sn} $, and $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $). We first examine the quartet condensation fraction in infinite symmetric nuclear matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interactions responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated as about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multi-nucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1701.00716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control of the transport of ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices is essential for the exploration of quantum phenomena and the development of advanced quantum technologies. Harnessing the distinctive characteristics of the system near integrability, we investigate the tunneling control of dipolar bosons confined within a triple-well circuit via dipole polarization orientation. Based on this control mechanism, we propose a quantum magnetic compass that shows sensitivity beyond the Heisenberg limit to small variations in the orientation of magnetic fields, making it a promising candidate for sensing applications.</description>

      <title>One-body dynamical correlation function of Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical correlated properties of one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases provide profound understanding of novel physics emergent from collective excitations, for instance, the breakdown of off-diagonal long-range order, and the establishment of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. However, due to the nonperturbative nature of 1D many-body systems, the exact evaluation of correlation functions is notoriously difficult. Here, by means of a form factor approach based on an algebraic Bethe ansatz and numerics, we present a thorough study on the one-body dynamical correlation function (1BDCF) of the Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature. The influence of thermal fluctuation and interaction on the behavior of 1BDCF has been demonstrated and analyzed from various perspectives, including the spectral distribution, the line shape at fixed momentum, and the corresponding static correlations.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Signature of localization-delocalization in collisional inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the localization transition in spin-orbit (SO) coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with collisional inhomogeneous interaction trapped in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential. Our numerical analysis shows that the competition between the quasiperiodic disorder and inhomogeneous interaction leads to a localization-delocalization transition as the interaction strength is tuned from attractive to repulsive in nature. Furthermore, we analyse the combined effect of the SO and Rabi coupling strengths on the localization transition for different interaction strengths and obtain signatures of similar localization-delocalization transition as a function of SO coupling in the regime of weak interactions. We complement our numerical observation with the analytical model using the Gaussian variational approach. In the end, we show how the localization-delocalization is manifested in the quench dynamics of the condensate. Our study provides an indirect approach to achieve localization transition without tuning the quasiperiodic potential strength, but rather by tuning the inhomogeneity in the interaction.</description>

      <title>Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in non-interacting Bose gases at thermal equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</description>

      <title>Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system
  itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the
  long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in
  shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose
  does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps
  ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just
  like the next-chapter button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe synchronisation in a thermal (35-60 {\deg}C) atomic (Rb) ensemble driven to a highly-excited Rydberg state (principle quantum number n ranging from 43 to 79). Synchronisation in this system is unexpected due to the atomic motion, however, we show theoretically that sufficiently strong interactions via a global Rydberg density mean field causes frequency and phase entrainment. The emergent oscillations in the vapor's bulk quantities are detected in the transmission of the probe laser for a two-photon excitation scheme.</description>

      <title>Effects of $p$-wave Interactions on Borromean Efimov Trimers in Heavy-Light Fermi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of $p$-wave interactions on Efimov trimers in systems comprising two identical heavy fermions and a light particle, with mass ratios larger than $13.6$. Our focus lies on the borromean regime where the ground-state trimer exists in the absence of dimers. Using pair-wise Lennard-Jones potentials and concentrating on the $L^{\pi} = 1^{-}$ symmetry, we explore the critical value of the interspecies $s$-wave scattering length $a_{c}$ at which the borromean state appears in several two-component particle systems. Our exploration encompasses the universal properties of $a_{c}$ and the influence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions on its value. We find that, in the absence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions, $a_{c}$ is determined universally by the van der Waals radius and mass ratio. However, the introduction of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions unveiled a departure from this universality. Our calculations show that the critical interspecies scattering length $a_{c}$ now depends on the details of the fermion-fermion $p$-wave interaction. And, the presence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions favors the formation of the borromean state. Additionally, our investigation reveals that Efimov effect in the $1^{-}$ symmetry persist even when the fermion-fermion interaction reaches the $p$-wave unitary limit.</description>

Abstract: Feshbach resonances play a vital role in the success of cold atoms investigating strongly-correlated physics. The recent observation of their solid-state analog in the scattering of holes and intralayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides [Schwartz et al., Science 374, 336 (2021)] holds compelling promise for bringing fully controllable interactions to the field of semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate how tunneling-induced layer hybridization can lead to the emergence of two distinct classes of Feshbach resonances in atomically thin semiconductors. Based on microscopic scattering theory we show that these two types of Feshbach resonances allow to tune interactions between electrons and both short-lived intralayer, as well as long-lived interlayer excitons. We predict the exciton-electron scattering phase shift from first principles and show that the exciton-electron coupling is fully tunable from strong to vanishing interactions. The tunability of interactions opens the avenue to explore Bose-Fermi mixtures in solid-state systems in regimes that were previously only accessible in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Engineering interactions by collective coupling of atom pairs to cavity photons for entanglement generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering atom-atom interactions is essential both for controlling novel phases of matter and for efficient preparation of many-body entangled states, which are key resources in quantum communication, computation, and metrology. In this work, we propose a scheme to tailor these interactions by coupling driven atom pairs to optical cavity photons via a molecular state in the dispersive regime, resulting in an effective photon-field-dependent potential. As an illustrative example, by analyzing the quantum Fisher information, we show that such induced interactions can generate robust many-body entanglement in two-mode ultracold bosons in an optical cavity. By tuning the photon-induced interactions through the cavity drive, we identify conditions for preparing highly entangled states on timescales that mitigate decoherence due to photon loss. Our results show that entanglement formation rate scales strongly with both photon and atom number, dramatically reducing the timescale compared to bare atomic interactions. We also identify an optimal measurement for exploiting the metrological potential of the atomic state in an interferometric protocol with significant photon losses, saturating the quantum Cramer-Rao lower bound. Furthermore, we show that despite these losses the atomic state exhibits strong Bell correlations. Our results pave the way for engineering atom-atom interactions to study novel phases of light and matter in hybrid atom-photon systems, as well as for tailoring complex quantum states for new quantum technology protocols and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <title>From explicit to spontaneous charge order and the fate of antiferromagnetic quantum Hall state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic quantum Hall insulator (AFQHI), where one of the spin components is in the quantum Hall state and the other in the trivial state, is an established phase emerging as a result of the Hubbard repulsion in spinful quantum Hall systems. The stabilization of the AFQHI requires a charge order preventing the effect of the spin-flip transformation on the electronic state to be compensated by a space-group operation, and is often induced via an ionic potential. While one would naively expect the nearest-neighbor (NN) density-density interaction favoring spontaneous charge order to result in qualitatively similar phenomena, an analysis of the Haldane-Hubbard model extended by the NN interaction finds no AFQHI. Here, by considering an extended version of the Harper-Hofstadter-Hubbard model we go beyond the honeycomb structure and suggest that the realization of the AFQHI generically requires an explicit charge order and cannot be emerged through a spontaneous charge order. We unveil how the AFQHI disappears upon approaching from the explicit to the spontaneous charge ordering limit. Our findings shine more light on the stabilization conditions of the AFQHI which can guide the future optical lattice experiments searching for this intriguing magnetic topological insulator phase.</description>

      <title>Genuine Quantum effects in Dicke-type Models at large atom numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of genuine quantum effects and beyond mean-field physics in the balanced and unbalanced open Dicke model with a large, yet finite number of atoms $N$. Such driven and dissipative quantum many-body systems have recently been realized in experiments involving ultracold gases inside optical cavities and are known to obey mean-field predictions in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$. Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite $N$, by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic $N\approx 1000$. While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing $N$ in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic $N$. They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description. This is due to the fact that the steady-state limit $t\rightarrow \infty$ and thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ do not commute.</description>
