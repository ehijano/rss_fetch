      <title>Toward P != NP: An Observer-Theoretic Separation via SPDP Rank and a ZFC-Equivalent Foundation within the N-Frame Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained separation framework for P vs NP developed entirely within ZFC. The approach consists of: (i) a deterministic, radius-1 compilation from uniform polynomial-time Turing computation to local sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomials with polylogarithmic contextual entanglement width (CEW); (ii) a formal Width-to-Rank upper bound for the resulting SPDP matrices at matching parameters; (iii) an NP-side identity-minor lower bound in the same encoding; and (iv) a rank-monotone, instance-uniform extraction map from the compiled P-side polynomials to the NP family. Together these yield a contradiction under the assumption P = NP, establishing a separation.
  We develop a correspondence between CEW, viewed as a quantitative measure of computational contextuality, and SPDP rank, yielding a unified criterion for complexity separation. We prove that bounded-CEW observers correspond to polynomial-rank computations (the class P), while unbounded CEW characterizes the class NP. This implies that exponential SPDP rank for #3SAT and related hard families forces P != NP within the standard framework of complexity theory.
  Key technical components include: (1) constructive lower bounds on SPDP rank via Ramanujan-Tseitin expander families; (2) a non-circular reduction from Turing-machine computation to low-rank polynomial evaluation; (3) a codimension-collapse lemma ensuring that rank amplification cannot occur within polynomial resources; and (4) proofs of barrier immunity against relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization. The result is a complete ZFC proof architecture whose primitives and compositions are fully derived, with community verification and machine-checked formalization left as future work.</description>

      <title>On Well-VE-Dominated Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph G=(V, E), a vertex is said to ve-dominate an edge if it is either incident with the edge or adjacent to one of its endpoints. A set of vertices is a ve-dominating set if it ve-dominates every edge of the graph. We introduce the class of well-ve-dominated graphs, defined as graphs in which all minimal ve-dominating sets have the same cardinality. After establishing several general structural properties of well-ve-dominated graphs, we show that recognizing whether a graph belongs to this class is co--NP--complete, highlighting the computational difficulty of the problem. Our main result is a complete structural characterization of well-ve-dominated trees, which yields a simple linear-time recognition algorithm and a constructive description of all trees in this class.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Induced Subgraph Characterization of Word-Representable Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The class of word-representable graphs, introduced in connection with the study of the Perkins semigroup by Kitaev and Seif, has attracted significant attention in combinatorics and theoretical computer science due to its deep connections with graph orientations and combinatorics on words. A graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation, which is an acyclic orientation such that for any directed path $v_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow v_m$ with $m \ge 2$, either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$, or, for all $1 \le i &lt; j \le m$, there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$. Split graphs, whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set, constitute a natural yet nontrivial subclass for studying word-representability. However, not all split graphs are semi-transitive, and the characterization of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for semi-transitive split graphs remains an open problem.
  In this paper, we introduce a new matrix property called the $I$-circular property, which is closely related to the well-known $D$-circular property introduced by Safe. The $I$-circular property requires that both the rows of a matrix and the pairwise intersections of rows form circular intervals under some linear ordering of the columns. Using this property, we establish a direct connection between the structure of semi-transitive split graphs and the matrix representation of their adjacency relationships. Our main result is a complete forbidden submatrix characterization of the $I$-circular property, which in turn provides a characterization for semi-transitive split graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Induced Subgraph Characterization of Word-Representable Co-bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$ is said to be word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V(G)$ such that, for any two distinct letters $x,y \in V(G)$, the letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $(x,y) \in E(G)$. Equivalently, a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation, that is, an acyclic orientation in which, for every directed path $v_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow v_m$ with $m \ge 2$, either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$, or, for all $1 \le i &lt; j \le m$, there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$. In this work, we provide a comprehensive structural and algorithmic characterization of word-representable co-bipartite graphs, a class of graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into two cliques.
  This work unifies graph-theoretic and matrix-theoretic perspectives. We first establish that a co-bipartite graph is a circle graph if and only if it is a permutation graph, thereby deriving a minimal forbidden induced subgraph characterization for co-bipartite circle graphs. The central contribution then connects semi-transitivity with the circularly compatible ones property of binary matrices. In addition to the structural characterization, the paper introduces a linear-time recognition algorithm for semi-transitive co-bipartite graphs, utilizing Safe's matrix recognition framework.</description>

      <title>Vertex-edge domination on subclasses of bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a simple undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the open neighbourhood of a vertex $v \in V$ is defined as $N_G(v) = \{u \in V \mid uv \in E\}$, and the closed neighbourhood as $N_G[v] = N_G(v) \cup \{v\}$. A subset $D \subseteq V$ is called a vertex-edge dominating set if, for every edge $uv \in E$, at least one vertex from $D$ appears in $N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]$; that is, $\vert (N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]) \cap D\vert \geq 1$. Intuitively, a vertex-edge dominating set ensures that every edge, as well as all edges incident to either of its endpoints, is dominated by at least one vertex from the set. The \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem asks for a vertex-edge dominating set of minimum size in a given graph. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this hardness result by proving that the problem remains NP-complete for two specific subclasses of bipartite graphs: star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it is known that the \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $(1 - \epsilon)\ln |V|$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{DTIME}(|V|^{O(\log \log |V|)})$. We also prove that this inapproximability result holds even for star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum vertex-edge dominating set in convex bipartite graphs. A polynomial-time algorithm for this graph class was also proposed by B{\"u}y{\"u}k{\c{c}}olak et al.~\cite{buyukccolak2025linear}, but we show that their algorithm has certain flaws by providing instances where it fails to produce an optimal solution. We address this issue by presenting a modified algorithm that correctly computes an optimal solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gartland and Lokshtanov conjectured that every graph that excludes some planar graph as an induced minor has a balanced separator, that is, a separator whose deletion leaves every component with no more than half of the vertices of the graph, which is dominated by a bounded number of vertices. We confirm this conjecture for excluding any fixed wheel, that is, a cycle together with a universal vertex, as an induced minor.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Indistinguishability, Multiplicity Automata Equivalence, and Polynomial Identity Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class $\mathcal{F}$ if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from every graph $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Many graph isomorphism relaxations such as (quantum) isomorphism and cospectrality can be characterised as homomorphism indistinguishability over specific graph classes. Thereby, the problems $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$ of deciding homomorphism indistinguishability over $\mathcal{F}$ subsume diverse graph isomorphism relaxations whose complexities range from logspace to undecidable. Establishing the first general result on the complexity of $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$, Seppelt (MFCS 2024) showed that $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$ is in randomised polynomial time for every graph class $\mathcal{F}$ of bounded treewidth that can be defined in counting monadic second-order logic $\mathsf{CMSO}_2$.
  We show that this algorithm is conditionally optimal, i.e. it cannot be derandomised unless polynomial identity testing is in $\mathsf{PTIME}$. For $\mathsf{CMSO}_2$-definable graph classes $\mathcal{F}$ of bounded pathwidth, we improve the previous complexity upper bound for $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$ from $\mathsf{PTIME}$ to $\mathsf{C}_=\mathsf{L}$ and show that this is tight. Secondarily, we establish a connection between homomorphism indistinguishability and multiplicity automata equivalence which allows us to pinpoint the complexity of the latter problem as $\mathsf{C}_=\mathsf{L}$-complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study "space efficient" FPT algorithms for graph problems with limited memory. Let n be the size of the input graph and k be the parameter. We present algorithms that run in time f(k)*poly(n) and use g(k)*polylog(n) working space, where f and g are functions of k alone, for k-Path, MaxLeaf SubTree and Multicut in Trees. These algorithms are motivated by big-data settings where very large problem instances must be solved, and using poly(n) memory is prohibitively expensive. They are also theoretically interesting, since most of the standard methods tools, such as deleting a large set of vertices or edges, are unavailable, and we must a develop different way to tackle them.</description>

      <title>A Distance Amplification Lemma for Monotonicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a procedure that, given oracle access to a function $f\colon \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$, produces oracle access to a function $f'\colon \{0,1\}^{n'}\to\{0,1\}$ such that if $f$ is monotone, then $f'$ is monotone, and if $f$ is $\varepsilon$-far from monotone, then $f'$ is $\Omega(1)$-far from monotone. Moreover, $n' \leq n 2^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ and each oracle query to $f'$ can be answered by making $2^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ oracle queries to $f$.
  Our lemma is motivated by a recent result of [Chen, Chen, Cui, Pires, Stockwell, arXiv:2511.04558], who showed that for all $c&gt;0$ there exists $\varepsilon_c&gt;0$, such that any (even two-sided, adaptive) algorithm distinguishing between monotone functions and $\varepsilon_c$-far from monotone functions, requires $\Omega(n^{1/2-c})$ queries. Combining our lemma with their result implies a similar result, except that the distance from monotonicity is an absolute constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and the lower bound is $\Omega(n^{1/2-o(1)})$ queries.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms of (n,m)-graphs with respect to generalised switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01258v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs, that is, adjacency preserving vertex mappings of graphs with $n$ types of arcs and $m$ types of edges was initiated by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Raspaud in 2000. Later, some attempts were made to generalize the switch operation that is popularly used in the study of signed graphs, and study its effect on the above mentioned homomorphism.
  In this article, we too provide a generalization of the switch operation on $(n,m)$-graphs, which to the best of our knowledge, encapsulates all the previously known generalizations as special cases. We approach the study of homomorphisms with respect to the switch operation axiomatically. We prove some fundamental results that are essential tools in the further study of this topic. In the process of proving the fundamental results, we have provided yet another solution to an open problem posed by Klostermeyer and MacGillivray in 2004. We also prove the existence of a categorical product for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to a particular class of generalized switch which implicitly uses category theory. This is a counter intuitive solution as the number of vertices in the Categorical product of two $(n,m)$-graphs on $p$ and $q$ vertices has a multiple of $pq$ many vertices, where the multiple depends on the switch. This solves an open question asked by Brewster in the PEPS 2012 workshop as a corollary. We also provide a way to calculate the product explicitly, and prove general properties of the product. We define the analog of chromatic number for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to generalized switch and explore the interrelations between chromatic numbers with respect to different switch operations. We find the value of this chromatic number for the family of forests using group theoretic notions.</description>

      <title>Profile and neighbourhood complexity of graphs excluding a minor and tree-structured graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{$r$-neighbourhood complexity} of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$. A~refinement of this notion is the \emph{$r$-profile complexity}, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than~$r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.
  We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes. We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most~$t$, we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of~$t$ as a factor. These bounds improve results of Joret and Rambaud and answer a question of their paper [Combinatorica, 2024]. We also apply our methods to other classes of bounded expansion such as graphs excluding a fixed complete graph as a subdivision.
  For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth. For graphs of treelength at most~$\ell$, we give the upper bound of $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$, which we improve to $O\left (k\cdot (r 2^k + r^2k^2) \right)$ in the case of chordal graphs and $O(k^2r)$ for interval graphs.
  Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</description>

      <title>Shortest Paths in a Weighted Simplicial Complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes are extensively studied in the field of algebraic topology. They have gained attention in recent time due to their applications in fields like theoretical distributed computing and simplicial neural networks. Graphs are mono-dimensional simplicial complex. Graph theory has application in topics like theoretical computer science, operations research, bioinformatics and social sciences. This makes it natural to try to adapt graph-theoretic results for simplicial complexes, which can model more intricate and detailed structures appearing in real-world systems. Though seemingly obvious, we did not find any previous work that looked into this prospect of simplicial complexes.
  In this article, we define the concept of weighted simplicial complex and $d$-path in a simplicial complex. Both these concepts have the potential to have numerous real-life applications. We start by adapting the Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms for our setup. Next, we provide two novel algorithms to find the shortest paths in a weighted simplicial complex. The core principles of our algorithms align with those of Dijkstra$^\prime$s algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm for graphs. Hence, this work lays a building block for the sake of integrating graph-theoretic concepts with abstract simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Las Vegas algorithms to generate universal cycles and de Bruijn sequences uniformly at random</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present practical algorithms for generating universal cycles uniformly at random. In particular, we consider universal cycles for shorthand permutations, subsets and multiset permutations, weak orders, and orientable sequences. Additionally, we consider de Bruijn sequences, weight-range de Bruin sequences, and de Bruijn sequences, with forbidden $0^z$ substring. Each algorithm, seeded with a random element from the given set, applies a random walk of an underlying Eulerian de Bruijn graph to obtain a random arborescence (spanning in-tree). Given the random arborescence and the de Bruijn graph, a corresponding random universal cycle can be generated in constant time per symbol. We present experimental results on the average cover time needed to compute a random arborescence for each object using a Las Vegas algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all n great thank or equal to 3, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n = 3 (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to 4 (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>
