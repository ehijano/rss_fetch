      <title>Infinite dimensional analogues of nilpotent and solvable Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinite-dimensional analogues of nilpotent and solvable Lie algebras, focusing on the classes of pro-nilpotent, residually nilpotent, pro-solvable and residually solvable Lie algebras. We extend classical triangularization results (Engel's and Lie's theorems) to the pro-setting and establish existence results for the pro-nilpotent radical in pro-solvable algebras and in certain residually solvable algebras. We adapt finite-dimensional construction methods to produce residually solvable extensions with a given pro-nilpotent radical under natural finiteness conditions. By analyzing derivations and maximal tori of pro-nilpotent algebras, we extend the notion of rank and show that, for pro-nilpotent algebras of maximal rank, every derivation of a maximal residually solvable extension is inner. Finally, we describe standard constructions (tensor and direct sum products, central extensions) that preserve pro-nilpotency.</description>

      <title>Abstract Cluster Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a framework for encoding cluster combinatorics using categorical methods. We give a definition of an abstract cluster structure, which captures the essence of cluster mutation at a tropical level and show that cluster algebras, cluster varieties, cluster categories and surface models all have associated abstract cluster structures. For the first two classes, we also show that they can be constructed from abstract cluster structures.
  By defining a suitable notion of morphism of abstract cluster structures, we introduce a category of these and show that it has several desirable properties, such as initial and terminal objects and finite products and coproducts. We also prove that rooted cluster morphisms of cluster algebras give rise to morphisms of the associated abstract cluster structures, so that our framework includes a version of the extant category of cluster algebras.
  We can do more, however, because we can relate different types of representation of abstract cluster structures (cluster algebra, varieties, categories) directly via morphisms of their associated abstract cluster structures, even though no direct map from e.g. a cluster category to the associated cluster algebra is possible.
  In fact, we do much of the above in the setting of abstract quantum cluster structures, with some analysis of the difference between the category of these and that of the unquantized version. In order to show the relationship between abstract quantum cluster structures and quantum cluster algebras, we reformulate the usual construction of the latter in a way that is more amenable to our purposes and which we expect will be of independent interest and use.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures of MRD Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:1502.02711v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on results in finite geometry we prove the existence of MRD codes in (F_q)_(n,n) with minimum distance n which are essentially different from Gabidulin codes. The construction results from algebraic structures which are closely related to those of finite fields. Some of the results may be known to experts, but to our knowledge have never been pointed out explicitly in the literature.</description>

      <title>Pointed Hopf algebras revisited, with a view from tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopf algebras appear in connection with various problems in Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, mainly through their categoriesof representations, which are examples of tensor categories. In recent years, there have been major advances in the classification of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over the complex numbers, especially when restricted to the pointed case. In this survey, we aim to review the main results in this direction, stating the classification theorems recently obtained and the problems still open, and describing the tools needed to solve the problem by means of the so-called Lifting Method of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider.
  We will highlight a more categorical point of view related to these classification results, which offers for a better description of the so-called liftings up to involving cocycle deformations, and which in turn allows certain problems to be reduced to the associated graded pointed Hopf algebras. We will emphasise this point of view with applications to other contexts related to the aforementioned pointed Hopf algebras, such as finite pointed tensor categories, Hopf algebras that do not satisfy the Chevalley property and their finite-dimensional Nichols algebras, and finally module categories over the categories of representations of pointed Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>On the free Lie-Yamaguti algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lie Yamaguti algebras appear naturally on the smooth sections of the tangent bundle of a reductive homogeneous space when we interpret the torsion and curvature as algebraic operators. In this article we present a description of the free Lie Yamaguti algebra.</description>

      <title>Classification of thin Jordan schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>

      <title>Centers of Endomorphism Rings and Reflexivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a local ring and let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module. Appealing to the natural left module structure of $M$ over its endomorphism ring and corresponding center $Z(\operatorname{End}_R(M))$, we study when various homological properties of $M$ are sufficient to force $M$ to have a nonzero free summand. Consequences of our work include a partial converse to a well-known result of Lindo describing $Z(\operatorname{End}_R(M))$ when $M$ is faithful and reflexive, as well as some applications to the famous Huneke-Wiegand conjecture.</description>
