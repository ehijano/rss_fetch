      <title>Leapfrogging of a deterministic model for microeconomic systems in competitive markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Behrens-Feichtinger model provides a deterministic picture for the co-evolution of sales of two firms, producing the same goods and competing in a common market. The model involves an active investment strategy such that the temporary investment of each of the two firms depends on its relative position in the market. In this work we are interested in a specific regime of evolution referred to as leapfrogging regime, in which each firm has the possibility to dominate the market alternately during some finite period of time. We examine conditions favoring the leapfrogging dynamics of the model by introducing two appropriate variables, namely the sale difference and total sale of the two firms at any time. An analysis of stability of fixed points of the resulting coupled discrete nonlinear equations is carried out, and the bifurcation diagrams of the sale difference and sum with respect to the elasticity coefficient, are generated. A time-series analysis suggests that the leapfrogging regime, characterized by periodic oscillations of the sale difference from positive to negative branches, is stabilized by specific values of characteristic parameters of the model and when in addition the elasticity coefficient, related to the difference in investment strategies of the two firms, is reasonably high. A positive sign of cumulated sales at any time is required to ensure the availability of goods during the leapfrogging dynamics.</description>

      <title>Information Leakages in the Green Bond Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public announcement dates are used in the green bond literature to measure equity market reactions to upcoming green bond issues. We find a sizeable number of green bond announcements were pre-dated by anonymous information leakages on the Bloomberg Terminal. From a candidate set of 2,036 'Bloomberg News' and 'Bloomberg First Word' headlines gathered between 2016 and 2022, we identify 259 instances of green bond-related information being released before being publicly announced by the issuing firm. These pre-announcement leaks significantly alter the equity trading dynamics of the issuing firms over intraday and daily event windows. Significant negative abnormal returns and increased trading volumes are observed following news leaks about upcoming green bond issues. These negative investor reactions are concentrated amongst financial firms, and leaks that arrive pre-market or early in market trading. We find equity price movements following news leaks can be explained to a greater degree than following public announcements. Sectoral differences are also observed in the key drivers behind investor reactions to green bond leaks by non-financials (Tobin's Q and free cash flow) and financials (ROA). Our results suggest that information leakages have a strong impact on market behaviour, and should be accounted for in green bond literature. Our findings also have broader ramifications for financial literature going forward. Privileged access to financially material information, courtesy of the ubiquitous use of Bloomberg Terminals by professional investors, highlights the need for event studies to consider wider sets of communication channels to confirm the date at which information first becomes available.</description>
