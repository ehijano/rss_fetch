      <title>Semantic Extraction Model Selection for IoT Devices in Edge-assisted Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications offer the potential to alleviate communication loads by exchanging meaningful information. However, semantic extraction (SE) is computationally intensive, posing challenges for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To address this, leveraging computing resources at the edge servers (ESs) is essential. ESs can support multiple SE models for various tasks, making it crucial to select appropriate SE models based on diverse requirements of IoT devices and limited ES computing resources. In this letter, we study an SE model selection problem, where the ES co-located at the access point can provide multiple SE models to execute the uploaded SE tasks of associated IoT devices. We aim to maximize the total semantic rate of all SE tasks by selecting appropriate SE models, while considering SE delay and ES capacity constraints, and SE accuracy requirements. The formulated NP-complete integer programming problem is transformed into a modified Knapsack problem. The proposed efficient approximation algorithm using dynamic programming can yield a guaranteed near-optimum solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Wireless Traffic Prediction and Network Optimization in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative method for predicting wireless network traffic in concise temporal intervals for Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) using a transformer architecture, which is the machine learning model behind generative AI tools. Depending on the anticipated traffic, the system either launches a reinforcement learning-based traffic steering xApp or a cell sleeping rApp to enhance performance metrics like throughput or energy efficiency. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed traffic prediction-based network optimization mechanism matches the performance of standalone RAN applications (rApps/ xApps) that are always on during the whole simulation time while offering on-demand activation. This feature is particularly advantageous during instances of abrupt fluctuations in traffic volume. Rather than persistently operating specific applications irrespective of the actual incoming traffic conditions, the proposed prediction-based method increases the average energy efficiency by 39.7% compared to the "Always on Traffic Steering xApp" and achieves 10.1% increase in throughput compared to the "Always on Cell Sleeping rApp". The simulation has been conducted over 24 hours, emulating a whole day traffic pattern for a dense urban area.</description>

      <title>Brain-on-Switch: Towards Advanced Intelligent Network Data Plane via NN-Driven Traffic Analysis at Line-Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging programmable networks sparked significant research on Intelligent Network Data Plane (INDP), which achieves learning-based traffic analysis at line-speed. Prior art in INDP focus on deploying tree/forest models on the data plane. We observe a fundamental limitation in tree-based INDP approaches: although it is possible to represent even larger tree/forest tables on the data plane, the flow features that are computable on the data plane are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints. In this paper, we present BoS to push the boundaries of INDP by enabling Neural Network (NN) driven traffic analysis at line-speed. Many types of NNs (such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and transformers) that are designed to work with sequential data have advantages over tree-based models, because they can take raw network data as input without complex feature computations on the fly. However, the challenge is significant: the recurrent computation scheme used in RNN inference is fundamentally different from the match-action paradigm used on the network data plane. BoS addresses this challenge by (i) designing a novel data plane friendly RNN architecture that can execute unlimited RNN time steps with limited data plane stages, effectively achieving line-speed RNN inference; and (ii) complementing the on-switch RNN model with an off-switch transformer-based traffic analysis module to further boost the overall performance. We implement a prototype of BoS using a P4 programmable switch as our data plane, and extensively evaluate it over multiple traffic analysis tasks. The results show that BoS outperforms state-of-the-art in both analysis accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Jointly Optimizing Terahertz based Sensing and Communications in Vehicular Networks: A Dynamic Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of vehicle service mode selection (sensing, communication, or both) and vehicle connections within terahertz (THz) enabled joint sensing and communications over vehicular networks is studied. The considered network consists of several service provider vehicles (SPVs) that can provide: 1) only sensing service, 2) only communication service, and 3) both services, sensing service request vehicles, and communication service request vehicles. Based on the vehicle network topology and their service accessibility, SPVs strategically select service request vehicles to provide sensing, communication, or both services. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the number of successfully served vehicles by jointly determining the service mode of each SPV and its associated vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic graph neural network (GNN) model that selects appropriate graph information aggregation functions according to the vehicle network topology, thus extracting more vehicle network information compared to traditional static GNNs that use fixed aggregation functions for different vehicle network topologies. Using the extracted vehicle network information, the service mode of each SPV and its served service request vehicles will be determined. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic GNN based method can improve the number of successfully served vehicles by up to 17% and 28% compared to a GNN based algorithm with a fixed neural network model and a conventional optimization algorithm without using GNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing algorithms play a crucial role in the efficient transmission of data within computer networks by determining the optimal paths for packet forwarding. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of routing algorithms, focusing on their fundamental principles, classification, challenges, recent advancements, and practical applications. Beginning with an overview of the significance of routing in modern communication networks, the paper delves into the historical evolution of routing algorithms, tracing their development from early approaches to contemporary techniques. Key categories of routing algorithms, including distance vector, link-state, and path vector algorithms, are examined in detail, along with hybrid approaches that integrate multiple routing paradigms. Common challenges faced by routing algorithms, such as routing loops and scalability issues, are identified, and current research efforts aimed at addressing these challenges are discussed.</description>

      <title>Studying and improving the performance of ETSI ITS contention-based forwarding (CBF) in urban and highway scenarios: S-FoT+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of ETSI ITS Contention-Based Forwarding (CBF) and ETSI Simple GeoBroadcast forwarding while disseminating warning messages over a Geographical Area in highway and urban scenarios. Our experimental evaluation considers the complete ETSI ITS architecture including the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) mechanism. We propose an enhanced CBF mechanism, named S-FOT+, which combines several improvements to the ETSI CBF algorithm. S-FoT+ has a similar or better performance than the ETSI forwarding algorithms regarding both reliability and end-to-end delay while requiring much fewer transmissions. The improvements are equally effective and efficient in both urban and highway scenarios with large Destination Areas. Finally, we evaluate the trade-offs that stem from using multi-hop broadcast mechanisms in urban settings with smaller Destination Areas when compared to single-hop broadcast. Results show that multi-hop mechanisms significantly improve coverage at the cost of an increased number of transmissions.</description>

      <title>Non-Primary Channel Access in IEEE 802.11 UHR: Comprehensive Analysis and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the IEEE 802.11 standards marks a significant throughput advancement in wireless access technologies, progressively increasing bandwidth capacities from 20 MHz in the IEEE 802.11a to up to 320 MHz in the latest IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7). However, the increased bandwidth capacities may not be well exploited due to inefficient bandwidth utilization incorporating primary channel and secondary channels. Particularly, when primary channel is busy, secondary channels (also known as non-primary channels) are prevented from being utilized even if they are idle, thereby wasting the available bandwidth. This paper investigates the fundamentals of the Non-Primary Channel Access (NPCA) protocol that was introduced in IEEE 802.11 Ultra-High Reliability (UHR) group to cope with the above issue. We propose a novel analytical model to assess NPCA protocol performance in terms of the average throughput and delay. Via simulation, we verify that the NPCA network outperforms the legacy network by increasing by at least 50% average throughput while reducing by at least 40% average delay.</description>

      <title>Traffic Weaver: semi-synthetic time-varying traffic generator based on averaged time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic Weaver is a Python package developed to generate a semi-synthetic signal (time series) with finer granularity, based on averaged time series, in a manner that, upon averaging, closely matches the original signal provided. The key components utilized to recreate the signal encompass oversampling with a given strategy, stretching to match the integral of the original time series, smoothing, repeating, applying trend, and adding noise. The primary motivation behind Traffic Weaver is to furnish semi-synthetic time-varying traffic in telecommunication networks, facilitating the development and validation of traffic prediction models, as well as aiding in the deployment of network optimization algorithms tailored for time-varying traffic.</description>

      <title>Laconic: Streamlined Load Balancers for SmartNICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load balancers are pervasively used inside today's clouds to scalably distribute network requests across data center servers. Given the extensive use of load balancers and their associated operating costs, several efforts have focused on improving their efficiency by implementing Layer-4 load-balancing logic within the kernel or using hardware acceleration. This work explores whether the more complex and connection-oriented Layer-7 load-balancing capability can also benefit from hardware acceleration. In particular, we target the offloading of load-balancing capability onto programmable SmartNICs. We fully leverage the cost and energy efficiency of SmartNICs using three key ideas. First, we argue that a full and complex TCP/IP stack is not required for Layer-7 load balancers and instead propose a lightweight forwarding agent on the SmartNIC. Second, we develop connection management data structures with a high degree of concurrency with minimal synchronization when executed on multi-core SmartNICs. Finally, we describe how the load-balancing logic could be accelerated using custom packet-processing accelerators on SmartNICs. We prototype Laconic on two types of SmartNIC hardware, achieving over 150 Gbps throughput using all cores on BlueField-2, while a single SmartNIC core achieves 8.7x higher throughput and comparable latency to Nginx on a single x86 core.</description>

      <title>Earth+: on-board satellite imagery compression leveraging historical earth observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of earth observation satellite constellations, the downlink (satellite-to-ground) capacity often limits the freshness, quality, and coverage of the imagery data available to applications on the ground. To overcome the downlink limitation, we present Earth+, a new satellite imagery compression system that, instead of compressing each image individually, pinpoints and downloads only recent imagery changes with respect to the history reference images. To minimize the amount of changes, it is critical to make reference images as fresh as possible. Earth+ enables each satellite to choose fresh reference images from not only its own history images but also past images of other satellites from an entire satellite constellation. To share reference images across satellites, Earth+ utilizes the limited capacity of the existing uplink (ground-to-satellite) by judiciously selecting and compressing reference images while still allowing accurate change detection. In short, Earth+ is the first to make reference-based compression efficient, by enabling constellation-wide sharing of fresh reference images across satellites. Our evaluation shows that Earth+ can reduce the downlink usage by a factor of 3.3 compared to state-of-the-art on-board image compression techniques while not sacrificing image quality, or using more on-board computing or storage resources, or more uplink bandwidth than currently available.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Handover in Mobile Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has recently spurred tremendous attention from academia and industry. 5G and 6G standards have specified LEO satellite network as a key component of 5G and 6G networks. However, ground terminals experience frequent, high-latency handover incurred by satellites' fast travelling speed, which deteriorates the performance of latency-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel handover flowchart for mobile satellite networks, which can considerably reduce the handover latency. The innovation behind this scheme is to mitigate the interaction between the access and core networks that occupy the majority of time overhead by leveraging the predictable travelling trajectory and spatial distribution inherent in mobile satellite networks. Specifically, we design a fine-grained synchronized algorithm to address the synchronization problem due to the lack of control signalling delivery between the access and core networks. Moreover, we minimize the computational complexity of the core network using information such as the satellite access strategy and unique spatial distribution, which is caused by frequent prediction operations. We have built a prototype for a mobile satellite network using modified Open5GS and UERANSIM, which is driven by actual LEO satellite constellations such as Starlink and Kuiper. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate that our proposed handover scheme can considerably reduce the handover latency compared to the 3GPP Non-terrestrial Networks (NTN) and two other existing handover schemes.</description>

      <title>Why E.T. Can't Phone Home: A Global View on IP-based Geoblocking at VoWiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current cellular network generations (4G, 5G) the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) plays an integral role in terminating voice calls and short messages. Many operators use VoWiFi (Voice over Wi-Fi, also Wi-Fi calling) as an alternative network access technology to complement their cellular coverage in areas where no radio signal is available (e.g., rural territories or shielded buildings). In a mobile world where customers regularly traverse national borders, this can be used to avoid expensive international roaming fees while journeying overseas, since VoWiFi calls are usually invoiced at domestic rates. To not lose this revenue stream, some operators block access to the IMS for customers staying abroad.
  This work evaluates the current deployment status of VoWiFi among worldwide operators and analyzes existing geoblocking measures on the IP layer. We show that a substantial share (IPv4: 14.6%, IPv6: 65.2%) of operators implement geoblocking at the DNS- or VoWiFi protocol level, and highlight severe drawbacks in terms of emergency calling service availability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CODECO Experimentation Framework is an open-source solution designed for the rapid experimentation of Kubernetes-based edge cloud deployments. It adopts a microservice-based architecture and introduces innovative abstractions for (i) the holistic deployment of Kubernetes clusters and associated applications, starting from the VM allocation level; (ii) declarative cross-layer experiment configuration; and (iii) automation features covering the entire experimental process, from the configuration up to the results visualization. We present proof-of-concept results that demonstrate the above capabilities in three distinct contexts: (i) a comparative evaluation of various network fabrics across different edge-oriented Kubernetes distributions; (ii) the automated deployment of EdgeNet, which is a complex edge cloud orchestration system; and (iii) an assessment of anomaly detection (AD) workflows tailored for edge environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Index Modulation Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access via Constellation Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been widely nominated as an emerging spectral efficiency (SE) multiple access technique for the next generation of wireless communication network. To meet the growing demands in massive connectivity and huge data in transmission, a novel index modulation aided NOMA with the rotation of signal constellation of low power users (IM-NOMA-RC) is developed to the downlink transmission. In the proposed IM-NOMA-RC system, the users are classified into far-user group and near-user group according to their channel conditions, where the rotation constellation based IM operation is performed only on the users who belong to the near-user group that are allocated lower power compared with the far ones to transmit extra information. In the proposed IM-NOMA-RC, all the subcarriers are activated to transmit information to multiple users to achieve higher SE. With the aid of the multiple dimension modulation in IM-NOMA-RC, more users can be supported over an orthogonal resource block. Then, both maximum likelihood (ML) detector and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector are studied for all the user. Numerical simulation results of the proposed IM-NOMARC scheme are investigate for the ML detector and the SIC detector for each users, which shows that proposed scheme can outperform conventional NOMA.</description>

      <title>CBR - Boosting Adaptive Classification By Retrieval of Encrypted Network Traffic with Out-of-distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encrypted network traffic Classification tackles the problem from different approaches and with different goals. One of the common approaches is using Machine learning or Deep Learning-based solutions on a fixed number of classes, leading to misclassification when an unknown class is given as input. One of the solutions for handling unknown classes is to retrain the model, however, retraining models every time they become obsolete is both resource and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a growing need to allow classification models to detect and adapt to new classes dynamically, without retraining, but instead able to detect new classes using few shots learning [1]. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Classification By Retrieval CBR, a novel approach for encrypted network traffic classification. Our new approach is based on an ANN-based method, which allows us to effectively identify new and existing classes without retraining the model. The novel approach is simple, yet effective and achieved similar results to RF with up to 5% difference (usually less than that) in the classification tasks while having a slight decrease in the case of new samples (from new classes) without retraining. To summarize, the new method is a real-time classification, which can classify new classes without retraining. Furthermore, our solution can be used as a complementary solution alongside RF or any other machine/deep learning classification method, as an aggregated solution.</description>

      <title>Open RAN-empowered V2X Architecture: Challenges, Opportunities, and Research Directions</title>

Abstract: The advances in the automotive industry with the ever-increasing request for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are pushing for a new epoch of networked wireless systems. Vehicular communications, or Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), are expected to be among the main actors of the future beyond 5G and 6G networks. However, the challenging application requirements, the fast variability of the vehicular environment, and the harsh propagation conditions of high frequencies call for sophisticated control mechanisms to ensure the success of such a disruptive technology. While traditional Radio Access Networks (RAN) lack the flexibility to support the required control primitives, the emergent concept of Open RAN (O-RAN) appears as an ideal enabler of V2X communication orchestration. However, how to effectively integrate the two ecosystems is still an open issue. In this paper, we discuss possible integration strategies, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of leveraging ORAN to enable real-time V2X control. Additionally, we enrich our discussion with potential research directions stemming from the current state-of-the-art and we provide preliminary simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed integration.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Real-World Evaluation of 5G Improvements over 4G in Low- and Mid-Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As discussions around 6G begin, it is important to carefully quantify the spectral efficiency gains actually realized by deployed 5G networks as compared to 4G through various enhancements such as higher modulation, beamforming, and MIMO. This will inform the design of future cellular systems, especially in the mid-bands, which provide a good balance between bandwidth and propagation. Similar to 4G, 5G also utilizes low-band (&lt;1 GHz) and mid-band spectrum (1 to 6 GHz), and hence comparing the performance of 4G and 5G in these bands will provide insights into how further improvements can be attained. In this work, we address a crucial question: is the performance boost in 5G compared to 4G primarily a result of increased bandwidth, or do the other enhancements play significant roles, and if so, under what circumstances? Hence, we conduct city-wide measurements of 4G and 5G cellular networks deployed in low- and mid-bands in Chicago and Minneapolis, and carefully quantify the contributions of different aspects of 5G advancements to its improved throughput performance. Our analyses show that (i) compared to 4G, the throughput improvement in 5G today is mainly influenced by the wider channel bandwidth, both from single channels and channel aggregation, (ii) in addition to wider channels, improved 5G throughput requires better signal conditions, which can be delivered by denser deployment and/or use of beamforming in mid-bands, (iii) the channel rank in real-world environments rarely supports the full 4 layers of 4x4 MIMO and (iv) advanced features such as MU-MIMO and higher order modulation such as 1024-QAM have yet to be widely deployed. These observations and conclusions lead one to consider designing the next generation of cellular systems to have wider channels, perhaps with improved channel aggregation, dense deployment with more beams.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Enigma of Satellite Computing with COTS Devices: Measurement and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the wake of the rapid deployment of large-scale low-Earth orbit satellite constellations, exploiting the full computing potential of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices in these environments has become a pressing issue. However, understanding this problem is far from straightforward due to the inherent differences between the terrestrial infrastructure and the satellite platform in space. In this paper, we take an important step towards closing this knowledge gap by presenting the first measurement study on the thermal control, power management, and performance of COTS computing devices on satellites. Our measurements reveal that the satellite platform and COTS computing devices significantly interplay in terms of the temperature and energy, forming the main constraints on satellite computing. Further, we analyze the critical factors that shape the characteristics of onboard COTS computing devices. We provide guidelines for future research on optimizing the use of such devices for computing purposes. Finally, we have released the datasets to facilitate further study in satellite computing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Task Meta-Learning: A Graph Neural Network Approach for Scalable and Transferable Bandwidth Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based bandwidth allocation policy that is: 1) scalable with the number of users and 2) transferable to different communication scenarios, such as non-stationary wireless channels, different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, and dynamically available resources. To support scalability, the bandwidth allocation policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN), with which the number of training parameters does not change with the number of users. To enable the generalization of the GNN, we develop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initial parameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios during meta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tune the GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our HML approach can improve the initial performance by $8.79\%$, and sampling efficiency by $73\%$, compared with existing benchmarks. After fine-tuning, our near-optimal GNN-based policy can achieve close to the same reward with much lower inference complexity compared to the optimal policy obtained using iterative optimization.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Secondary Coexistence in a Real-World CBRS Deployment</title>

Abstract: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.S. has made the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band (3.55 - 3.7 GHz) available for commercial wireless usage under a shared approach using a three-tier hierarchical architecture, where the federal incumbent is the highest priority Tier 1 user, Priority Access License (PAL) holders, who have paid for licenses, are Tier 2 users and Tier 3 users operate under General Authorized Access (GAA), without license fees or protection from higher priority users. The Spectrum Access System (SAS) ensures that higher priority users are protected from interference from lower priority users. However, the lowest priority GAA users are not given any protection from each other by the SAS and are expected to not cause any harmful interference to Tier 1 and Tier 2 users. As the deployments of GAA devices grow, the potential for secondary interference between GAA users increases, especially since the SAS architecture does not allow dynamic channel switching when faced with interference. In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind extensive measurement campaign of a commercial CBRS network deployed in the city of South Bend, IN, that quantifies both co-channel interference (CCI) and adjacent channel interference (ACI) caused by competing GAA devices and C-band 5G, respectively. We (i) identify a particular CCI scenario and improve performance by changing the frequency allocation based on our study of other allocations in the vicinity and (ii) quantify ACI from 5G in C-band (3.7 GHz) on CBRS throughput. We conclude that (i) CCI and ACI for GAA users is not handled well by the SAS, (ii) proper frequency allocation for GAA requires additional analysis of interference from other GAA users followed by dynamical channel selection, and (iii) utilization of immediate adjacent channels by high power 5G deployments limits the performance of CBRS.</description>

      <title>ACM MMSys 2024 Bandwidth Estimation in Real Time Communications Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems to end users depends in part on correctly estimating the capacity of the bottleneck link between the sender and the receiver over time. Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications (RTC) remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the continuously evolving heterogeneous network architectures and technologies. From the first bandwidth estimation challenge which was hosted at ACM MMSys 2021, we learned that bandwidth estimation models trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in simulations to maximize network-based reward functions may not be optimal in reality due to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of aligning network-based rewards with user-perceived QoE. This grand challenge aims to advance bandwidth estimation model design by aligning reward maximization with user-perceived QoE optimization using offline RL and a real-world dataset with objective rewards which have high correlations with subjective audio/video quality in Microsoft Teams. All models submitted to the grand challenge underwent initial evaluation on our emulation platform. For a comprehensive evaluation under diverse network conditions with temporal fluctuations, top models were further evaluated on our geographically distributed testbed by using each model to conduct 600 calls within a 12-day period. The winning model is shown to deliver comparable performance to the top behavior policy in the released dataset. By leveraging real-world data and integrating objective audio/video quality scores as rewards, offline RL can therefore facilitate the development of competitive bandwidth estimators for RTC.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Modeling of Network Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network flow problems, which involve distributing traffic such that the underlying infrastructure is used effectively, are ubiquitous in transportation and logistics. Among them, the general Multi-Commodity Network Flow (MCNF) problem concerns the distribution of multiple flows of different sizes between several sources and sinks, while achieving effective utilization of the links. Due to the appeal of data-driven optimization, these problems have increasingly been approached using graph learning methods. In this paper, we propose a novel graph learning architecture for network flow problems called Per-Edge Weights (PEW). This method builds on a Graph Attention Network and uses distinctly parametrized message functions along each link. We extensively evaluate the proposed solution through an Internet flow routing case study using $17$ Service Provider topologies and $2$ routing schemes. We show that PEW yields substantial gains over architectures whose global message function constrains the routing unnecessarily. We also find that an MLP is competitive with other standard architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between graph structure and predictive performance for data-driven routing of flows, an aspect that has not been considered by existing work in the area.</description>
