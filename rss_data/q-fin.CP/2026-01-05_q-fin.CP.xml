      <title>Full grid solution for multi-asset options pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pricing multi-asset options via the Black-Scholes PDE is limited by the curse of dimensionality: classical full-grid solvers scale exponentially in the number of underlyings and are effectively restricted to three assets. Practitioners typically rely on Monte Carlo methods for computing complex instrument involving multiple correlated underlyings. We show that quantized tensor trains (QTT) turn the d-asset Black-Scholes PDE into a tractable high-dimensional problem on a personal computer. We construct QTT representations of the operator, payoffs, and boundary conditions with ranks that scale polynomially in d and polylogarithmically in the grid size, and build two solvers: a time-stepping algorithm for European and American options and a space-time algorithm for European options. We compute full-grid prices and Greeks for correlated basket and max-min options in three to five dimensions with high accuracy. The methods introduced can comfortably be pushed to full-grid solutions on 10-15 underlyings, with further algorithmic optimization and more compute power.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Insights into Credit Risk Modelling: Integrating Climate and Text Data for Default Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit risk assessment increasingly relies on diverse sources of information beyond traditional structured financial data, particularly for micro and small enterprises (mSEs) with limited financial histories. This study proposes a multimodal framework that integrates structured credit variables, climate panel data, and unstructured textual narratives within a unified learning architecture. Specifically, we use long short-term memory (LSTM), the gated recurrent unit (GRU), and transformer models to analyse the interplay between these data modalities. The empirical results demonstrate that unimodal models based on climate or text data outperform those relying solely on structured data, while the integration of multiple data modalities yields significant improvements in credit default prediction. Using SHAP-based explainability methods, we find that physical climate risks play an important role in default prediction, with water-logging by rain emerging as the most influential factor. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in AI-enabled decision-making, which provides robust tools for credit risk assessment while contributing to the broader integration of environmental and textual insights into predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>Second Thoughts: How 1-second subslots transform CEX-DEX Arbitrage on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of reducing Ethereum slot time on decentralized exchange activity, with a focus on CEX-DEX arbitrage behavior. We develop a trading model where the agent's DEX transaction is not guaranteed to land, and the agent explicitly accounts for this execution risk when deciding whether to pursue arbitrage opportunities. We compare agent behavior under Ethereum's default 12-second slot time environment with a faster regime that offers 1-second subslot execution. The simulations, calibrated to Binance and Uniswap v3 data from July to September 2025, show that faster slot times increase arbitrage transaction count by 535% and trading volume by 203% on average. The increase in CEX-DEX arbitrage activity under 1-second subslots is driven by the reduction in variance of both successful and failed trade outcomes, increasing the risk-adjusted returns and making CEX-DEX arbitrage more appealing.</description>
