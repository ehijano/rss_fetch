      <title>Bit reset protocols that obey activity-constrained speed limits do not minimize work for a given speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of thermodynamic optimal control theory is to find protocols to change the state of a system from an initial to a desired final distribution, within a finite time, with the least possible expenditure of work. The optimal protocol is closely linked to the intrinsic dynamics of the system at hand. The fact that these dynamics can vary widely has made a general solution elusive. Recent years have seen great progress by recasting the question in terms of a quantity called total activity, i.e. the average number of jumps between states of the system, rather than the time that the operation is allowed to take. This perspective has allowed for general expressions for the minimal work as a function of the total activity, and the minimal total activity required for a given work. The expression for minimal total activity can be recast as an apparent minimal operation time or speed limit. However, it is unclear whether protocols optimized under a constrained activity actually require the lowest work input for a given operation time. In the context of bit reset, we show that directly minimizing work for a given operation time leads to protocols that require significantly less work to perform the operation than the activity-constrained protocol of the same duration. We show how the resulting protocols differ. One reason for the difference is the fact that the activity rate is not constant over the course of the protocol: it depends on both the transition rates and the distribution of the bit, both of which change during the copy operation. In the limit of long protocol duration, we find an expression for the difference between the resulting minimal work for both optimization schemes, for a general class of dynamics. The time-constrained approach always outperforms the activity-constrained approach for a given constrained duration, and the difference in work can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Partition function zeros for the Blume-Capel model on a complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study finite-size effects in the Blume-Capel model through the analysis of the zeros of the partition function. We consider a complete graph and make use of the behaviour of the partition function zeros to elucidate the crossover from effective to asymptotic properties. While in the thermodynamic limit the exact solution yields the asymptotic mean-field behaviour, for finite system sizes an effective critical behaviour is observed. We show that even for large systems, the criticality is not asymptotic. We also present insights into how partition function zeros in different complex fields (temperature, magnetic field, crystal field) give different precision and provide us with different parts of the larger picture. This includes the differences between criticality and tricriticality as seen through the lens of Fisher, Lee-Yang, and Crystal Field zeros.</description>

      <title>Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible dynamics with mitigation in connection of infected population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model is analyzed through a degree-based mean-field approach. In this work, a mitigation factor is introduced in the probability of finding an infected individual following an edge. This modification simulates situations where the infected population reduces its participation in the dynamics of disease propagation, as may happen with the seclusion or hospitalization of infected individuals. A detailed investigation of this new model and its comparison to the original one (without the mitigation factor) was performed on the Barab\'asi-Albert network, where some important results were analytically accessible.</description>

      <title>Probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function (PDF) of the order parameter of the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model at criticality using the functional renormalisation group. For this purpose, we generalize the method introduced in [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)] to the $O(N)$ model. We study the large $N$ limit, as well as the cases $N=2$ and $N=3$ at the level of the Local Potential Approximation (LPA), and compare our results to Monte Carlo simulations. We compute the entire family of universal scaling functions, obtained in the limit where the system size $L$ and the correlation length of the infinite system $\xi_\infty$ diverge, with the ratio $\zeta=L/\xi_\infty$ constant. We also generalize our results to the approach of criticality from the low-temperature phase where another infinite family of universal PDF exists. We find that the LPA describes very well the functional form of the family of PDFs, once we correct for a global amplitude of the (logarithm of the) PDF and of $\zeta$.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity increases transition path probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defining low-dimensional reaction coordinates is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of complex systems and for comparison with experiments. The maximal value of the transition-path probability along the reaction coordinate $x$, $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$, is a common estimator for reaction-coordinate quality by comparing to the theoretical maximal value of 1/2 in the overdamped Markovian limit. We show by analytical arguments and simulations that for non-Markovian dynamics $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ is non-monotonic as a function of the memory time and exceeds 1/2 for long memory time. This disqualifies $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ as a criterion for reaction coordinate quality.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological prethermal strong zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases cannot be described by any local order parameter and are beyond the conventional symmetry-breaking paradigm for understanding quantum matter. They are characterized by topological boundary states robust against perturbations that respect the protecting symmetry. In a clean system without disorder, these edge modes typically only occur for the ground states of systems with a bulk energy gap and would not survive at finite temperatures due to mobile thermal excitations. Here, we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge modes, which are protected by emergent symmetries and persist even up to infinite temperature, with an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. In particular, through digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of a one-dimensional disorder-free "cluster" Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles at a wide range of temperatures. By monitoring the propagation of thermal excitations, we show that despite the free mobility of these excitations, their interactions with the edge modes are substantially suppressed in the dimerized regime due to an emergent U(1)$\times$U(1) symmetry, resulting in an unusually prolonged lifetime of the topological edge modes even at infinite temperature. In addition, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence in the dimerized and off-resonant regime, despite the system being disorder-free and far from its ground state. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach to experimentally exploring a variety of finite-temperature topological phases and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived robust boundary qubits that survive to infinite temperature in disorder-free systems.</description>

      <title>Functional Decomposition and Estimation of Irreversibility in Time Series via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel, simple, and flexible method to quantify irreversibility in generic high-dimensional time series based on the well-known mapping to a binary classification problem. Our approach utilizes gradient boosting for estimation, providing a model-free, nonlinear analysis able to handle large-dimensional systems while requiring minimal or no calibration. Our procedure is divided into three phases: trajectory encoding, Markovian order identification, and hypothesis testing for variable interactions. The latter is the key innovation that allows us to selectively switch off variable interactions to discern their specific contribution to irreversibility. When applied to financial markets, our findings reveal a distinctive shift: during stable periods, irreversibility is mainly related to short-term patterns, whereas in unstable periods, these short-term patterns are disrupted, leaving only contributions from stable long-term ones. This observed transition underscores the crucial importance of high-order variable interactions in understanding the dynamics of financial markets, especially in times of turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the critical behavior of classical frustrated systems using the nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) equation. Our study is performed within the local potential approximation of this equation to which is added the flow of the field renormalization. Our flow equations are functional to avoid possible artifacts coming from the field expansion of the fixed point potential which consists in keeping only a limited number of coupling constants. We explain in detail our numerical implementation, its advantages and the difficulties encountered in the vicinity of $d=2$. For $N$-component spins, the function $N_c(d)$ separating the regions of first and second order transitions in the $(d,N)$ plane is computed for $d$ between 4 and 2.3. Our results confirm what was previously found with cruder approximations of the NPRG equation and contradict both the fixed dimension perturbative approach and some of the results obtained within the conformal bootstrap approach.</description>

      <title>Tricriticality and finite-size scaling in the triangular Blume-Capel ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on numerical simulations of the two-dimensional spin-$1$ Blume-Capel ferromagnet embedded in a triangular lattice. Utilizing a range of Monte Carlo and finite-size scaling techniques, we explore several critical aspects along the crystal field--temperature ($\Delta, T$) transition line. Wang-Landau simulations measuring the joint density of states in combination with the method of field mixing allow us to probe the phase coexistence curve in high resolution, determining the tricritical point $(\Delta_{\rm t}, T_{\rm t})$ with improved accuracy and verifying the tricritical exponents. Extensive multicanonical simulations identifying transition points across the phase diagram characterize the Ising universality class for $\Delta &lt; \Delta_{\rm t}$ with precise determination of thermal and magnetic critical exponents expected in the second-order regime. On the other hand, for $\Delta &gt; \Delta_{\rm t}$, a finite-size scaling analysis is dedicated to revealing the first-order signature in the surface tension that linearly increases upon lowering the temperature deeper into the first-order transition regime. Finally, a comprehensive picture of the phase diagram for the model is presented, collecting transition points obtained from the combined numerical approach in this study and previous estimates in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Origins of suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to uncover their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. We find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and relative to observations of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Using coarse-grained simulations, we find that the extracted shape and strength of the interparticle potential explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes, in addition to designing microscopic strategies to avert gelation.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of the macroscopically degenerate tetramer-dimer phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Metadensity functional theory for classical fluids: Extracting the pair potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excess free energy functional of classical density functional theory depends upon the type of fluid model, specifically on the choice of (pair) potential, is unknown in general, and is approximated reliably only in special cases. We present a machine learning scheme for training a neural network that acts as a generic metadensity functional for truncated but otherwise arbitrary pair potentials. Automatic differentiation and neural functional calculus then yield, for one-dimensional fluids, accurate predictions for inhomogeneous states and immediate access to the pair distribution function. The approach provides a means of addressing a fundamental problem in the physics of liquids, and for soft matter design: How best to invert structural data to obtain the pair potential?</description>

      <title>A Sinking Approach to Explore Arbitrary Areas in Free Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, numerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the exploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach accelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with pre-defined collective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV range. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions within the CV space. This paper introduces a novel "sinking" approach that enables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by proposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates the effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique. Building on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which "sinks" the interior bias potential to create restraining potential "cliffs" at the grid edges. This technique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a preset area. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal sampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of various shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and one-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta will pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially offering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy paths in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Kinetic model for transport in granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different non-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the relaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the kinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently adapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass, momentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third nonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform shear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are computed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the transport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are also explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its theoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results and computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the comparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations. While the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the Boltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the case of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate dependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with increasing inelasticity in collisions.</description>

      <title>The dipolar Aleppo lattice: Ground state ordering and ergodic dynamics in the absence of vertex frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.</description>
