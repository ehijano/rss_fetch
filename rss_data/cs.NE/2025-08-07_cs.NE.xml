      <title>GP and LLMs for Program Synthesis: No Clear Winners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) and large language models (LLMs) differ in how program specifications are provided: GP uses input-output examples, and LLMs use text descriptions. In this work, we compared the ability of PushGP and GPT-4o to synthesize computer programs for tasks from the PSB2 benchmark suite. We used three prompt variants with GPT-4o: input-output examples (data-only), textual description of the task (text-only), and a combination of both textual descriptions and input-output examples (data-text). Additionally, we varied the number of input-output examples available for building programs. For each synthesizer and task combination, we compared success rates across all program synthesizers, as well as the similarity between successful GPT-4o synthesized programs. We found that the combination of PushGP and GPT-4o with data-text prompting led to the greatest number of tasks solved (23 of the 25 tasks), even though several tasks were solved exclusively by only one of the two synthesizers. We also observed that PushGP and GPT-4o with data-only prompting solved fewer tasks with the decrease in the training set size, while the remaining synthesizers saw no decrease. We also detected significant differences in similarity between the successful programs synthesized for GPT-4o with text-only and data-only prompting. With there being no dominant program synthesizer, this work highlights the importance of different optimization techniques used by PushGP and LLMs to synthesize programs.</description>

      <title>STARE: Predicting Decision Making Based on Spatio-Temporal Eye Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work proposes a Deep Learning architecture for the prediction of various consumer choice behaviors from time series of raw gaze or eye fixations on images of the decision environment, for which currently no foundational models are available. The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the neurophysiology of eye movements.</description>

      <title>TDSNNs: Competitive Topographic Deep Spiking Neural Networks for Visual Cortex Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this, we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sliding control parameters for a 3-dof robot arm using genetic algorithm (GA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC) parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions. However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce the chattering effect.</description>

      <title>The Glider Equation for Asymptotic Lenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the ``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed, expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching for High-Dimensional Snapshot Data at Irregular Time Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting, enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's versatility.</description>

      <title>Case Studies of Generative Machine Learning Models for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems like aircraft and spacecraft are expensive to operate in the real world. The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on a combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a relatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors, simplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models often does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider the broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly reduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or image-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM development for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with scarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing equations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this paper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems that are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely: minimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a threat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of the order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing equations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training loss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system trajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative adversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder (VAE). We provide architectural details and thorough performance analyses of these models. The main finding is that our new models, especially the VAE-based models, are able to synthesize data that satisfy the governing equations and are statistically similar to the training data despite small volumes of training data.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to emotion detection using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). Unlike traditional unimodal techniques that rely on a single data type, we explore a multimodal framework integrating text, audio, and facial expressions. The proposed cGAN architecture is trained to generate synthetic emotion-rich data and improve classification accuracy across multiple modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in emotion recognition performance compared to baseline models. This work highlights the potential of cGANs in enhancing human-computer interaction systems by enabling more nuanced emotional understanding.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Cybersecurity with Semi-supervised Lifelong Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>pyhgf: A neural network library for predictive coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pyhgf}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs. The code, tutorials and documentation are hosted at: https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf.</description>

      <title>NACHOS: Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved. This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN</description>

      <title>Long-Term Visual Object Tracking with Event Cameras: An Associative Memory Augmented Tracker and A Benchmark Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing event stream based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark</description>

      <title>Time Evidence Fusion Network: Multi-source View in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.</description>

      <title>Learning richness modulates equality reasoning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09781</link>

Abstract: Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference may be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result, same-different (SD) tasks have been extensively studied as a starting point for understanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the rise of neural networks that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for abstractions, equality reasoning in these models has also gained interest. Yet despite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and with little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD tasks, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum of behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual behavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning, and insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is characterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied by the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a mathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning richness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime MLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in vision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by encouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies feature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and suggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on learning richness in neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates in Besov Norms and Sample-Complexity of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Residual Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perceptron (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation result with a statistical guarantee by bounding the pseudodimension of the relevant class of Res-KANs. As an application of the latter, we directly deduce a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples, showing that KANs can learn the smooth maps which they can approximate.</description>

      <title>A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</description>

      <title>Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves &gt; 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.</description>
