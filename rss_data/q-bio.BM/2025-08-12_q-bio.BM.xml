      <title>Cation-DNA outer sphere coordination in DNA polymorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two approaches to describing DNA-ions interactions. The physical approach is an analysis of electrostatic interactions between ions and charges on the DNA molecule. The coordination chemistry approach is a search for modes of direct binding of ions to ionophores of DNA. We study both the inner and outer sphere coordination of ions by ionophores of the A and C forms of DNA in molecular dynamics simulations in two low-polarity solvents: in ethanol-water and methanol-water mixtures. We show that the counterion-DNA outer sphere coordination plays a key role in the experimentally observed conformational polymorphism of the DNA molecule: a transition to the A form in ethanol and to the C form in methanol. We identify the ionophores responsible for the existence of the A- and C-complexes. In both the complexes, the ions' inner sphere ligands are mostly water molecules, the ions reside in water clusters. In ethanol-water mixture, the water clusters are large, the major groove of the A-DNA is filled with water, and all ionophores are accessible to ions. In methanol-water mixture, the water clusters are small, and a large number of methanol clusters are present near DNA surface. They interfere with the coordination of ions in one of the ionophores of the major groove, and also with other ionophores near phosphates. Therefore, in methanol, the interaction energy of counterions with A-DNA cannot compensate for the repulsion of closely located phosphates. Therefore, the ions fill more accessible ionophores of the C-complex, converting DNA into the C form.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dark Energy in the Functional Protein Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to localize and quantify the functional evolutionary constraints on natural proteins. The method compares the perturbations caused by local sequence variants to the energetics of the protein folding process and to the corresponding change to the apparent selection landscape of sequences over the evolutionary time scale. The difference between the physical folding free energies and the evolutionary free energies can be called a "Dark Energy". We analyse various protein sets and thereby show that Dark Energy is largely localized at functional sites, which are often energetically frustrated from the point of view of folding. Overall, we find that about 25% of the positions of the folded globular proteins display some significant Dark Energy. When a function relies on a free energy that can be thermodynamically quantified, such as a binding energy to a partner, the relationship of this physical free energy with Dark Energy can be used to define a Functional Selection Temperature. We show that selection for folding and binding functions bear similar weights in specific protein-protein interactions.</description>

      <title>GFlowNets for Learning Better Drug-Drug Interaction Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology, with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Reaction Coordinate Optimization with Histories: A Framework for Rare Event Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding, chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics. Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.</description>

      <title>RNA-FrameFlow: Flow Matching for de novo 3D RNA Backbone Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce RNA-FrameFlow, the first generative model for 3D RNA backbone design. We build upon SE(3) flow matching for protein backbone generation and establish protocols for data preparation and evaluation to address unique challenges posed by RNA modeling. We formulate RNA structures as a set of rigid-body frames and associated loss functions which account for larger, more conformationally flexible RNA backbones (13 atoms per nucleotide) vs. proteins (4 atoms per residue). Toward tackling the lack of diversity in 3D RNA datasets, we explore training with structural clustering and cropping augmentations. Additionally, we define a suite of evaluation metrics to measure whether the generated RNA structures are globally self-consistent (via inverse folding followed by forward folding) and locally recover RNA-specific structural descriptors. The most performant version of RNA-FrameFlow generates locally realistic RNA backbones of 40-150 nucleotides, over 40% of which pass our validity criteria as measured by a self-consistency TM-score &gt;= 0.45, at which two RNAs have the same global fold.

      <title>ScaffoldGPT: A Scaffold-based GPT Model for Drug Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug optimization has become increasingly crucial in light of fast-mutating virus strains and drug-resistant cancer cells. Nevertheless, it remains challenging as it necessitates retaining the beneficial properties of the original drug while simultaneously enhancing desired attributes beyond its scope. In this work, we aim to tackle this challenge by introducing ScaffoldGPT, a novel Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) designed for drug optimization based on molecular scaffolds. Our work comprises three key components: (1) A three-stage drug optimization approach that integrates pretraining, finetuning, and decoding optimization. (2) A novel two-phase incremental pre-training strategy for scaffold-based drug optimization. (3) A token-level decoding optimization strategy, Top-N, that enabling controlled, reward-guided generation using the pretrained or finetuned GPT. We demonstrate via a comprehensive evaluation on COVID and cancer benchmarks that ScaffoldGPT outperforms the competing baselines in drug optimization benchmarks, while excelling in preserving original functional scaffold and enhancing desired properties.</description>

      <title>AMix-1: A Pathway to Test-Time Scalable Protein Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AMix-1, a powerful protein foundation model built on Bayesian Flow Networks and empowered by a systematic training methodology, encompassing pretraining scaling laws, emergent capability analysis, in-context learning mechanism, and test-time scaling algorithm. To guarantee robust scalability, we establish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of structural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong 1.7-billion model. Building on this foundation, we devise a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild type. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1 with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed evolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification budgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation lab-in-the-loop protein design.</description>

      <title>Compound Mutations in the Abl1 Kinase Cause Inhibitor Resistance by Shifting DFG Flip Mechanisms and Relative State Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of most proteins are central to their function. Protein tyrosine kinases such as Abl1 undergo significant conformational changes that modulate their activity in response to different stimuli. These conformational changes constitute a conserved mechanism for self-regulation that dramatically impacts kinases' affinities for inhibitors. Few studies have attempted to extensively sample the pathways and elucidate the mechanisms that underlie kinase inactivation. Seeking to bridge this knowledge gap, we present a thorough analysis of the ``DFG flip'' inactivation pathway in Abl1 kinase. By leveraging the power of the Weighted Ensemble methodology, which accelerates sampling without the use of biasing forces, we have comprehensively simulated DFG flip events in Abl1 and its inhibitor-resistant variants, revealing a rugged landscape punctuated by potentially druggable intermediate states. Through our strategy, we successfully simulated dozens of uncorrelated DFG flip events distributed along two principal pathways, identified the molecular mechanisms that govern them, and measured their relative probabilities. Further, we show that the compound Glu255Lys/Val Thr315Ile Abl1 variants owe their inhibitor resistance phenotype to an increase in the free energy barrier associated with completing the DFG flip. This barrier stabilizes Abl1 variants in conformations that can lead to loss of binding for Type-II inhibitors such as Imatinib or Ponatinib. Finally, we contrast our Abl1 observations with the relative state distributions and propensity for undergoing a DFG flip of evolutionarily-related protein tyrosine kinases with diverging Type-II inhibitor binding affinities. Altogether, we expect that our work will be of significant importance for protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovery.</description>
