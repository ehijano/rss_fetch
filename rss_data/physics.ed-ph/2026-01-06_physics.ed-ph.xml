      <title>Simulating diffusion and disorder-induced localization in random walks and transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two complementary simulations that lead to an exploration of Anderson localization, a phenomenon in which wave diffusion is suppressed in disordered media by interference from multiple scattering. To build intuition, the first models the random walk of classical, non-interacting point-like particles, providing a clear analogy to the way disorder can limit transport. The second examines the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a one-dimensional, lossless transmission line with randomly varying propagation constant and characteristic impedance along its length, a system that captures the interference effects essential for true Anderson localization. We evaluate quantitative measures that reveal the transition from normal diffusion to localization of particles in one case, and the exponential confinement of wave energy in the other. Together, these simulations offer a pair of accessible tools for investigating localization phenomena in an instructional setting.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying 3641 job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms. However, there are signs that change may be forthcoming, indicated by a strong presence of Bachelor's and Master's graduates in the workforce.</description>
