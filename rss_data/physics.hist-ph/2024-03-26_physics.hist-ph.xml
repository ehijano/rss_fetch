      <title>The Compton scientific mission in Brazil in 1941: a perspective from national newspaper and documents of the time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the perspective of reports published in Brazilian newspapers at the time, as well as letters exchanged between scientists who worked in Brazil and North American colleagues and documents from the symposium on cosmic rays, a chronological sequence of how the so-called Compton mission in Brazil took place and was perceived by the literate public will be presented.</description>

      <title>Relational Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Relativism, and the Iteration of Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea that the dynamical properties of quantum systems are invariably relative to other systems has recently regained currency. Using Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) for a case study, this paper calls attention to a question that has been underappreciated in the debate about quantum relativism: the question of whether relativity iterates. Are there absolute facts about the properties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this again a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known form) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP), and thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a crucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction outcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the widespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead necessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts. I conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist versions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the need for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration principle for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Why interference phenomena do not capture the essence of quantum theory"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently argued by Catani et al that it is possible to reproduce the phenomenology of quantum interference classically, by the double-slit experiment with a deterministic, local, and classical model (Quantum 7, 1119 (2023)). The stated aim of their argument is to falsify the claim made by Feynman (in his third book of Lectures on Physics) that quantum interference is ``impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way'' and that it ``contains the only mystery'' of quantum mechanics. We here want to point out some problems with their argument.</description>
