      <title>First-Order Sparse Convex Optimization: Better Rates with Sparse Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$, where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient, $\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to implement.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of the value function in a stopper vs. singular-controller game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of zero-sum stochastic games between a stopper and a singular-controller, previously considered in [Bovo and De Angelis (2025)]. The underlying singularly-controlled dynamics takes values in $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. The problem is set on a finite time-horizon and is connected to a parabolic variational inequality of min-max type with spatial-derivative and obstacle constraints.
  We show that the value function of the problem is of class $C^1$ in the whole domain $[0,T)\times\mathcal{O}$ and that the second-order spatial derivative and the second-order mixed derivative are continuous everywhere except for a (potential) jump across a non-decreasing curve (the stopping boundary of the game). The latter discontinuity is a natural consequence of the partial differential equation associated to the problem. Beyond its intrinsic analytical value, such a regularity for the value function is a stepping stone for further exploring the structure and properties of the free-boundaries of the stochastic game, which in turn determine the optimal strategies of the players.</description>

      <title>Relative Explanations for Contextual Problems with Endogenous Uncertainty: An Application to Competitive Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider contextual stochastic optimization problems subject to endogenous uncertainty, where the decisions affect the underlying distributions. To implement such decisions in practice, it is crucial to ensure that their outcomes are interpretable and trustworthy. To this end, we compute relative counterfactual explanations, providing practitioners with concrete changes in the contextual covariates required for a solution to satisfy specific constraints. Whereas relative explanations have been introduced in prior literature, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focused on problems with binary decision variables and subject to endogenous uncertainty. We propose a methodology that uses Wasserstein distance as regularization and to compute a lower bound. It leads to a drastic reduction in computation times, compared to the unregularized counterpart. We illustrate the method using a choice-based competitive facility location problem, and present numerical experiments that demonstrate its ability to efficiently compute sparse and interpretable explanations.</description>

      <title>Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly. However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation. Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem under Uncertain Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) for service and goods distribution operations has led to the emergence of Electric Vehicle Routing Problems (EVRPs), a class of vehicle routing problems addressing the unique challenges posed by the limited driving range and recharging needs of EVs. While the majority of EVRP variants have considered deterministic energy consumption, this paper focuses on the Stochastic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with a Threshold recourse policy (SEVRP-T), where the uncertainty in energy consumption is considered, and a recourse policy is employed to ensure that EVs recharge at Charging Stations (CSs) whenever their State of Charge (SoC) falls below a specified threshold. We formulate the SEVRP-T as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer second-order cone model, where the first stage determines the sequences of customers to be visited, and the second stage incorporates charging activities. The objective is to minimize the expected total duration of the routes, composed by travel times and recharging operations. To cope with the computational complexity of the model, we propose a heuristic based on an Iterated Local Search (ILS) procedure coupled with a Set Partitioning problem. To further speed up the heuristic, we develop two lower bounds on the corresponding first-stage customer sequences. Furthermore, to handle a large number of energy consumption scenarios, we employ a scenario reduction technique. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution strategy and to assess the importance of considering the stochastic nature of the energy consumption. The research presented in this paper contributes to the growing body of literature on EVRP and provides insights into managing the operational deployment of EVs in logistics activities under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence of a primal-dual dynamical system with implicit Hessian damping and Tikhonov regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two primal-dual dynamical systems for solving linear equality constrained convex optimization problems: one with implicit Hessian damping only, and the other further incorporating Tikhonov regularization. We analyze the fast convergence properties of both dynamical systems and show that they achieve the same convergence rates. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first theoretical analysis establishing a convergence rate $o(\frac{1}{t^2})$ for the primal-dual gap and a convergence rate $o(\frac{1}{t})$ for the velocity $\dot{x}(t)$, without imposing additional assumptions on the objective function beyond convexity and L-smoothness. Moreover, we show that the trajectory generated by the dynamical system with Tikhonov regularization converges strongly to the minimum-norm solution of the underlying problem. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings. Interestingly, the trajectories exhibit smooth behavior even when the objective function is only continuously differentiable.</description>

      <title>Integrated Balanced and Staggered Routing in Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems, centrally coordinated fleets of self-driving vehicles, offer a promising alternative to traditional ride-hailing by improving traffic flow and reducing operating costs. Centralized control in AMoD systems enables two complementary routing strategies: balanced routing, which distributes traffic across alternative routes to ease congestion, and staggered routing, which delays departures to smooth peak demand over time. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that jointly optimizes both route choices and departure times to minimize system travel times. We formulate the problem as an optimization model and show that our congestion model yields an unbiased estimate of travel times derived from a discretized version of Vickrey's bottleneck model. To solve large-scale instances, we develop a custom metaheuristic based on a large neighborhood search framework. We assess our method through a case study on the Manhattan street network using real-world taxi data. In a setting with exclusively centrally controlled AMoD vehicles, our approach reduces total traffic delay by up to 25 percent and mitigates network congestion by up to 35 percent compared to selfish routing. We also consider mixed-traffic settings with both AMoD and conventional vehicles, comparing a welfare-oriented operator that minimizes total system travel time with a profit-oriented one that optimizes only the fleet's travel time. Independent of the operator's objective, the analysis reveals a win-win outcome: across all control levels, both autonomous and non-autonomous traffic benefit from the implementation of balancing and staggering strategies.</description>

      <title>On the computation of the cosine measure in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In derivative-free optimization, the cosine measure is a value that often arises in the convergence analysis of direct search methods. Given the increasing interest in high-dimensional derivative-free optimization problems, it is valuable to compute the cosine measure in this setting; however, it has recently been shown to be NP-hard. We propose a new formulation of the problem and heuristic to tackle this problem in higher dimensions and compare it with existing algorithms in the literature. In addition, new results are presented to facilitate the construction of sets with specific cosine measures, allowing for the creation of a test-set to benchmark the algorithms with.</description>

      <title>An approach to control design for two-level quantum ensemble systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum ensemble systems arise in a variety of applications, including NMR spectroscopy and robust quantum control. While their theoretical properties have been extensively studied, relatively little attention has been given to the explicit construction of control inputs. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a fully implementable control strategy for a one-parameter family of driftless two-level quantum systems. The proposed method is supported by rigorous analysis that guarantees accurate approximation of target distributions on SU(2). Convergence properties are established analytically, and numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Exact Matrix Seriation through Mathematical Optimization: Stress and Effectiveness-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix seriation, the problem of permuting the rows and columns of a matrix to uncover latent structure, is a fundamental technique in data science, particularly in the visualization and analysis of relational data. Applications span clustering, anomaly detection, and beyond. In this work, we present a unified framework grounded in mathematical optimization to address matrix seriation from a rigorous, model-based perspective. Our approach leverages combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization to represent seriation objectives and constraints with high fidelity, bridging the gap between traditional heuristic methods and exact solution techniques.
  We introduce new mathematical programming models for neighborhood-based stress criteria, including nonlinear formulations and their linearized counterparts. For structured settings such as Moore and von Neumann neighborhoods, we develop a novel Hamiltonian path-based reformulation that enables effective control over spatial arrangement and interpretability in the reordered matrix.
  To assess the practical impact of our models, we carry out an extensive set of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as on a newly curated benchmark based on a coauthorship network from the matrix seriation literature. Our results show that these optimization-based formulations not only enhance solution quality and interpretability but also provide a versatile foundation for extending matrix seriation to new domains in data science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $\{\omega_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be two orthonormal bases for a finite dimensional p-adic Hilbert space $\mathcal{X}$. Let $M,N\subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ be such that \begin{align*} \displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|&lt;1, \end{align*} where $o(M)$ is the cardinality of $M$. Then for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we show that \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|x\|\leq \left(\frac{1}{1-\displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|}\right)\max\left\{\displaystyle \max_{j \in M^c}|\langle x, \tau_j\rangle |, \displaystyle \max_{k \in N^c}|\langle x, \omega_k\rangle |\right\}. \end{align}
  We call Inequality (1) as \textbf{p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle}. Inequality (1) is the p-adic version of uncertainty principle obtained by Ghobber and Jaming \textit{[Linear Algebra Appl., 2011]}. We also derive analogues of Inequality (1) for non-Archimedean Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism in Sequential Auctions under Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient, truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.</description>

      <title>Vertex addition to a ball graph with application to reliability and area coverage in autonomous swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance $1$. These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.</description>

      <title>Poset-Markov Channels: Capacity via Group Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing channel capacity is in general intractable because it is given by the limit of a sequence of optimization problems whose dimensionality grows to infinity. As a result, constant-sized characterizations of feedback or non-feedback capacity are known for only a few classes of channels with memory. This paper introduces poset-causal channels$\unicode{x2014}$a new formalism of a communication channel in which channel inputs and outputs are indexed by the elements of a partially ordered set (poset). We develop a novel methodology that allows us to establish a single-letter upper bound on the feedback capacity of a subclass of poset-causal channels whose memory structure exhibits a Markov property and symmetry. The methodology is based on symmetry reduction in optimization. We instantiate our method on two channel models: the Noisy Output is The STate (NOST) channel$\unicode{x2014}$for which the bound is tight$\unicode{x2014}$and a new two-dimensional extension of it.</description>

Abstract: Partial differential equations can be used for extracting geometric features of shapes. This article summarizes recent methods to extract the normal vector field from an elliptic equation proposed by Yamada and from the heat equation, and also a method to extract the (signed) distance function from an elliptic equation that generalizes Varadhan's in 1967.</description>

      <title>Finite-Horizon Strategy in Infinite-Horizon Linear-Quadratic Discrete-Time Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a finite-horizon strategy, ``watching $T$ steps into the future and moving one step now,'' in an $N$-person infinite-horizon discrete-time linear-quadratic dynamic game. The game involves linear input/output/state dynamics and quadratic cost functions with heterogeneous discount factors. For the finite-horizon version, which forms the basis of the infinite-horizon game, we analyze the structure of the coupled generalized discrete Riccati difference equations related to the feedback Nash equilibrium (FNE) and derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the finite-horizon FNE. Under this condition, the FNE can be efficiently computed via the proposed algorithm. In the infinite-horizon game, assume all players adopt this finite-horizon strategy. If the iterations of the coupled equations related to the FNE converge, and the invertibility and stability conditions hold, we prove the convergence of each player's total cost under the finite-horizon strategy, even when players use individual prediction horizons. Furthermore, we provide an explicit upper bound on the cost difference between the finite-horizon strategy and the infinite-horizon FNE associated with the limiting matrices, expressed via the distance between their feedback strategy matrices. This bound vanishes as $T$ tends to infinity, implying convergence to the infinite-horizon FNE cost. A non-scalar numerical example illustrates the convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Toward Decision-Oriented Prognostics: An Integrated Estimate-Optimize Framework for Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO. This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target. These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain operational environments.</description>

      <title>Controllability of Boussinesq flows driven by finite-dimensional and physically localized forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show approximate controllability of Boussinesq flows in $\mathbb{T}^2 = \mathbb{R}^2 / 2\pi\mathbb{Z}^2$ driven by finite-dimensional controls that are supported in any fixed region $\omega \subset \mathbb{T}^2$. This addresses a Boussinesq version of a question by Agrachev and provides a first example of fluid PDEs controllable in that sense. In particular, we add in this context to results obtained for the Navier-Stokes system by Agrachev-Sarychev (Comm. Math. Phys. 265, 2006), where the controls are finite-dimensional but not localized in physical space, and Nersesyan-Rissel (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78, 2025), where physically localized controls admit for special $\omega$ a degenerate but not finite-dimensional structure.
  For our proof, we study controllability properties of tailored convection equations governed by time-periodic degenerately forced Euler flows that provide a twofold geometric mechanism: transport of information through $\omega$ versus non-stationary mixing effects transferring energy from low-dimensional sources to higher frequencies. The temperature is then controlled by using Coron's return method, while the velocity is mainly driven by the buoyant force.
  When $\omega$ contains two cuts of the torus and a closed square of side-length $L$, our approach yields explicit control spaces for the velocity and temperature of dimensions $2 + 18\lceil2\pi/L\rceil^2 + 8\lceil2\pi/L\rceil^4$ and $2 + 8\lceil2\pi/L\rceil^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Observability and Performance Tradeoffs in Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a feedback controller that minimizes the observability of a set of adversarial sensors of a linear system, while adhering to strict closed-loop performance constraints. We quantify the effectiveness of adversarial sensors using the trace of their observability Gramian and its inverse, capturing both average observability and the least observable state directions of the system. We derive theoretical lower bounds on these metrics under performance constraints, characterizing the fundamental limits of observability reduction as a function of the performance tradeoff. Finally, we show that the performance-constrained optimization of the Gramian's trace can be formulated as a one-shot semidefinite program, while we address the optimization of its inverse through sequential semidefinite programming. Simulations on an aircraft show how the proposed scheme yields controllers that deteriorate adversarial observability while having near-optimal closed-loop performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04672v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of nonconvex minimax games has gained significant momentum in machine learning and decision science communities due to their fundamental connections to adversarial training scenarios. This work develops a primal-dual alternating proximal gradient (PDAPG) algorithm framework for resolving iterative minimax games featuring nonsmooth nonconvex objectives subject to coupled linear constraints. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees for both nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-concave game configurations, demonstrating that PDAPG achieves an $\varepsilon$-stationary solution within $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-2} \right)$ iterations for strongly concave settings and $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-4} \right)$ iterations for concave scenarios. Our analysis provides the first known iteration complexity bounds for this class of constrained minimax games, particularly addressing the critical challenge of coupled linear constraints that induce inherent interdependencies among strategy variables. The proposed game-theoretic framework advances existing solution methodologies by simultaneously handling nonsmooth components and coordinated constraint structures through alternating primal-dual updates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19225v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven technique to automatically learn contextual uncertainty sets in robust optimization, resulting in excellent worst-case and average-case performance while also guaranteeing constraint satisfaction. Our method reshapes the uncertainty sets by minimizing the expected performance across a contextual family of problems, subject to conditional-value-at-risk constraints. Our approach is very flexible, and can learn a wide variety of uncertainty sets while preserving tractability. We solve the constrained learning problem using a stochastic augmented Lagrangian method that relies on differentiating the solutions of the robust optimization problems with respect to the parameters of the uncertainty set. Due to the nonsmooth and nonconvex nature of the augmented Lagrangian function, we apply the nonsmooth conservative implicit function theorem to establish convergence to a critical point, which is a feasible solution of the constrained problem under mild assumptions. Using empirical process theory, we show finite-sample probabilistic guarantees of constraint satisfaction for the resulting solutions. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional approaches in robust and distributionally robust optimization in terms of out-of-sample performance and constraint satisfaction guarantees.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Riccati Tensor Equations with Applications in Multilinear Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Chen et al. [8], the authors initiated the control-theoretic study of a class of discrete-time multilinear time-invariant (MLTI) control systems, where system states, inputs, and outputs are all tensors endowed with the Einstein product. They established criteria for fundamental system-theoretic notions such as stability, reachability, and observability through tensor decomposition. Building on this new research direction, the purpose of our paper is to extend the study to continuous-time MLTI control systems. Specifically, we define Hamiltonian tensors and symplectic tensors, and we establish the Schur-Hamiltonian tensor decomposition and the symplectic tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on these concepts, we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and demonstrate that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stabilizable and detectable. To find numerical solutions to the ARTE, we introduce a tensor-based Newton method. Additionally, we establish the tensor versions of the bounded real lemma and the small gain theorem. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is also conducted. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Interpolating between Optimal Transport and KL regularized Optimal Transport using R\'enyi Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularized optimal transport (OT) has received much attention in recent years starting from Cuturi's introduction of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularized OT. In this paper, we propose regularizing the OT problem using the family of $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergences for $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. R\'enyi divergences are neither $f$-divergences nor Bregman distances, but they recover the KL divergence in the limit $\alpha \nearrow 1$. The advantage of introducing the additional parameter $\alpha$ is that for $\alpha \searrow 0$ we obtain convergence to the unregularized OT problem. For the KL regularized OT problem, this was achieved by letting the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ tend to zero, which causes numerical instabilities. We present two different ways to obtain premetrics on probability measures, namely by R\'enyi divergence constraints and by penalization. The latter premetric interpolates between the unregularized and the KL regularized OT problem with weak convergence of the unique minimizer, generalizing the interpolation property of KL regularized OT. We use a nested mirror descent algorithm to solve the primal formulation. Both on real and synthetic data sets R\'enyi regularized OT plans outperform their KL and Tsallis counterparts in terms of being closer to the unregularized transport plans and recovering the ground truth in inference tasks better.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication in Multi-team Dynamic Games: A Mean Field Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$--Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.</description>

Abstract: We will show that a multifunction is strictly proto-differentiable at a point of its graph if and only if it is graphically strictly differentiable, i.e., the graph of the multifunction locally coincides, up to a change of coordinates, with the graph of a single-valued mapping, which is strictly differentiable at the transformed reference point. This result allows point-based characterizations of strict proto-differentiability in terms of various generalized derivatives. Further we will prove that under strict proto-differentiability the properties of strong metric regularity, metric regularity and strong metric subregularity are equivalent. Finally, under strict proto-differentiability of the subgradient mapping, we provide a novel second-order relation between function values and subgradients for prox-regular functions which constitutes a nonsmooth extension of the trapezoidal rule of numerical integration.</description>

      <title>Online Rack Placement in Large-Scale Data Centers: Online Sampling Optimization and Deployment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the configuration of large-scale data centers toward cost-effective, reliable and sustainable cloud supply chains. The problem involves placing incoming racks of servers within a data center to maximize demand coverage given space, power and cooling restrictions. We formulate an online integer optimization model to support rack placement decisions. We propose a tractable online sampling optimization (OSO) approach to multi-stage stochastic optimization, which approximates unknown parameters with a sample path and re-optimizes decisions dynamically. We prove that OSO achieves a strong competitive ratio in canonical online resource allocation problems and sublinear regret in the online batched bin packing problem. Theoretical and computational results show it can outperform mean-based certainty-equivalent resolving heuristics. Our algorithm has been packaged into a software solution deployed across Microsoft's data centers, contributing an interactive decision-making process at the human-machine interface. Using deployment data, econometric tests suggest that adoption of the solution has a negative and statistically significant impact on power stranding, estimated at 1-3 percentage point. At the scale of cloud computing, these improvements in data center performance result in significant cost savings and environmental benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for the general linear programming problem. This algorithm is an implicit reduction procedure that works as follows. Primal and dual problems are combined into a special system of linear equations constrained by complementarity relations and non-negative variables. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of applying a pair of complementary Gauss-Jordan pivoting operations, guided by a necessary-condition lemma. The algorithm requires no more than k+n iterations, as there are only k+n complementary pairs of columns to compare one-pair-at-a-time, where k is the number of constraints and n is the number of variables of given general linear programming problem. Numerical illustration is given that includes an instance of a classical problem of Klee and Minty and a problem of Beale.</description>

Abstract: Pairwise comparison matrices and the weight vectors obtained from them are important concepts in multi-criteria decision making. A weight vector calculated from a pairwise comparison matrix is called Pareto efficient if the approximation of the matrix elements by the weight ratios cannot be improved for any element of the matrix without worsening it for another element. The aim of this paper is to show the geometrical properties of the set of Pareto efficient weight vectors for $4\times 4$ pairwise comparison matrices. We prove that the set of efficient weight vectors is a union of three tetrahedra, each determined by four weight vectors calculated from an incomplete submatrix of the pairwise comparison matrix that can be represented by a path-type spanning tree graph. It is shown that with suitable rearrangements the orientations of the $4$-cycles in the Blanquero-Carrizosa-Conde graphs for the efficient weight vectors are determined as well. The special cases (double perturbed, simple perturbed, consistent matrices) are discussed in the appendices.</description>

      <title>Ambulance Allocation for Patient-Centered Care</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the United States and similar systems typically utilize a single treatment pathway, transporting all patients to emergency departments (EDs), regardless of their actual care needs or preferences. Recent policy reforms have sought to introduce alternative treatment pathways to divert lower acuity patients from the ED, but operationalizing these options has proven difficult. This paper proposes a patient-centered EMS (PC-EMS) ambulance allocation model that supports multiple care pathways by aligning EMS responses with individual patient needs. We develop a two-stage mixed-integer optimization framework that incorporates multiple dispatch and secondary assignment strategies which enable dynamic resource deployment. The model maximizes appropriate ED diversions while maintaining ambulance availability using a queueing-based availability constraint. We leverage national EMS data and machine learning to estimate dispatcher accuracy and diversion potential. Simulations across diverse geographic regions suggest that agencies can achieve up to 80% of possible ED diversions by equipping only 15 to 25% of their fleet with diversion capable units. Adaptive dispatch strategies improve diversion rates by 3.4 to 8.6 times compared to conventional single unit dispatch. These results provide actionable guidance for PC-EMS implementation by quantifying the trade off between equipment investment and operational coordination. Using the allocation model, agencies can strategically choose between upgrading fewer units with advanced dispatching protocols versus larger fleet investments with simpler operations. This approach offers flexible pathways suited to different organizational capabilities and implementation readiness.</description>

      <title>CatMADS: Mesh Adaptive Direct Search for constrained blackbox optimization with categorical variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving optimization problems in which functions are blackboxes and variables involve different types poses significant theoretical and algorithmic challenges. Nevertheless, such settings frequently occur in simulation-based engineering design and machine learning. This paper extends the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm to address mixed-variable problems with categorical, integer and continuous variables. MADS is a robust derivative-free optimization framework with a well-established convergence analysis for constrained quantitative problems. CatMADS generalizes MADS by incorporating categorical variables through distance-induced neighborhoods. A detailed convergence analysis of CatMADS is provided, with flexible choices balancing computational cost and local optimality strength. Four types of mixed-variable local minima are introduced, corresponding to progressively stronger notions of local optimality. CatMADS integrates the progressive barrier strategy for handling constraints, and ensures Clarke stationarity. An instance of \catmads employs cross-validation to construct problem-specific categorical distances. This instance is compared to state-of-the-art solvers on 32 mixed-variable problems, half of which are constrained. Data profiles show that CatMADS achieves the best results, demonstrating that the framework is empirically efficient in addition to having strong theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Acceleration Without Strong Convexity Priors Or Restarts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerated optimization methods are typically parametrized by the Lipschitz smoothness and strong convexity parameters of a given problem, which are rarely known in practice. While the Lipschitz smoothness parameter L can be easily estimated by backtracking, directly estimating (i.e., without restarts) the strong convexity parameter m remains an open problem. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing NAG-free, an optimization method that achieves acceleration while estimating m online without priors or restarts. Our method couples Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) method with an inexpensive estimator that does not require additional computation, only storage of one more iterate and gradient. We prove that in the canonical setting of the open problem, NAG-free converges globally at least as fast as gradient descent and locally at an accelerated rate, without resorting to m priors or restarts. We also introduce a complementary estimator for L, symmetric to the m estimator. We provide extensive empirical evidence that this NAG-free heuristic with L and m estimators often achieves acceleration in practice, outperforming restart schemes and traditional accelerated methods parametrized by offline estimates of L and m. Our experiments also suggest that NAG-free might be effective even for nonconvex problems when combined with restarts.</description>

      <title>PSD and SOS Biquadratic Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert indicated that a positive semi-definite (psd) homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables may not be sum of squares (sos). {Since a} $2 \times 2$ biquadratic polynomial is a homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables{, this raises a fundamental question:} Is a psd $2 \times 2$ biquadratic polynomial sos? In this paper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic polynomial to be sos. We show that if a $2 \times 2$ {psd} biquadratic polynomial is sos, then it is sos of tetranomials, its sos rank is at most $4$, and the coefficients of the tetranomials can be orthogonal to each other. We prove that every psd $2\times 2$ biquadratic polynomial admits an equivalent representation with two neighbor half-cross terms and one full-cross term. Furthermore, any $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic polynomial is a sum of squares of binomials (sosb) when it contains at most one half-cross term, and a sum of squares of trinomials (sostri) when it contains exactly two neighbor half-cross terms and no full-cross term.</description>

      <title>A Robust Twin Parametric Margin Support Vector Machine for Multiclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce novel Twin Parametric Margin Support Vector Machine (TPMSVM) models designed to address multiclass classification tasks under feature uncertainty. To handle data perturbations, we construct bounded-by-norm uncertainty set around each training observation and derive the robust counterparts of the deterministic models using robust optimization techniques. To capture complex data structure, we explore both linear and kernel-induced classifiers, providing computationally tractable reformulations of the resulting robust models. Additionally, we propose two alternatives for the final decision function, enhancing models' flexibility. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed robust multiclass TPMSVM methodology on real-world datasets, showing the good performance of the approach in the presence of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Constructive Universal Approximation and Finite Sample Memorization by Narrow Deep ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fully constructive analysis of deep ReLU neural networks for classification and function approximation tasks. First, we prove that any dataset with $N$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $M$ output classes can be exactly classified using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of width $2$ and depth at most $2N + 4M - 1$, with all network parameters constructed explicitly. This result is sharp with respect to width and is interpreted through the lens of simultaneous or ensemble controllability in discrete nonlinear dynamics.
  Second, we show that these explicit constructions yield uniform bounds on the parameter norms and, in particular, provide upper estimates for minimizers of standard regularized training loss functionals in supervised learning. As the regularization parameter vanishes, the trained networks converge to exact classifiers with bounded norm, explaining the effectiveness of overparameterized training in the small-regularization regime.
  We also prove a universal approximation theorem in $L^p(\Omega; \mathbb{R}_+)$ for any bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $p \in [1, \infty)$, using MLPs of fixed width $d + 1$. The proof is constructive, geometrically motivated, and provides explicit estimates on the network depth when the target function belongs to the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}$. We also extend the approximation and depth estimation results to $L^p(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^m)$ for any $m \geq 1$.
  Our results offer a unified and interpretable framework connecting controllability, expressivity, and training dynamics in deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optimals and their role in sustaining turbulence in channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous recovery of a corroded boundary and admittance using the Kohn-Vogelius method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying an unknown portion $\Gamma$ of the boundary of a $d$-dimensional ($d \in \{1, 2\}$) domain $\Omega$ and its associated Robin admittance coefficient, using two sets of boundary Cauchy data $(f, g)$--representing boundary temperature and heat flux--measured on the accessible portion $\Sigma$ of the boundary. Identifiability results \cite{Bacchelli2009,PaganiPierotti2009} indicate that a single measurement on $\Sigma$ is insufficient to uniquely determine both $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$, but two independent inputs yielding distinct solutions ensure the uniqueness of the pair $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. In this paper, we propose a cost function based on the energy-gap of two auxiliary problems. We derive the variational derivatives of this objective functional with respect to both the Robin boundary $\Gamma$ and the admittance coefficient $\alpha$. These derivatives are utilized to develop a nonlinear gradient-based iterative scheme for the simultaneous numerical reconstruction of $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>
