      <title>On a bipartite graph defined on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $L(G)$ be the set of all subgroups of $G$. We introduce a bipartite graph $\mathcal{B}(G)$ on $G$ whose vertex set is the union of two sets $G \times G$ and $L(G)$, and two vertices $(a, b) \in G \times G$ and $H \in L(G)$ are adjacent if $H$ is generated by $a$ and $b$. We establish connections between $\mathcal{B}(G)$ and the generating graph of $G$. We also discuss about various graph parameters such as independence number, domination number, girth, diameter, matching number, clique number, irredundance number, domatic number and minimum size of a vertex cover of $\mathcal{B}(G)$. We obtain relations between $\mathcal{B}(G)$ and certain probabilities associated to finite groups. We also obtain expressions for various topological indices of $\mathcal{B}(G)$. Finally, we realize the structures of $\mathcal{B}(G)$ for the dihedral groups of order $2p$ and $2p^2$ and dicyclic groups of order $4p$ and $4p^2$ (where $p$ is any prime) including certain other small order groups.</description>

      <title>The $p$-rationality of height-zero characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and present evidence for a conjectural global-local phenomenon concerning the $p$-rationality of $p$-height-zero characters. Specifically, if $\chi$ is a height-zero character of a finite group $G$ and $D$ is a defect group of the $p$-block of $G$ containing $\chi$, then the $p$-rationality of $\chi$ can be captured inside the normalizer $N_G(D)$.</description>

Abstract: In previous work, all finite simple groups that act with fixity 4 have been classified. In this article we investigate which ones of these groups act faithfully on a compact Riemann surface of genus at least 2 with fixity four in total and in such a way that fixity 4 is exhibited on at least one orbit.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic in Group Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a generalization of the concept of a pc presentation that applies to groups with a nontrivial solvable radical. Such a representation can be much more efficient in terms of memory use and even of arithmetic, than permuattion and matrix representations. We illustrate the use of such representations by constructing a maximal subgroup of the sporadic monster group and calculating its -- hitherto unknown -- character table.</description>

      <title>Commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the commuting graph of a Rees matrix semigroup over a group and investigate its properties: diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree. The maximum size of a commutative subsemigroup of a Rees matrix semigroup over a group is presented, and its largest commutative subsemigroups are exhibited. We use the knowledge we obtained from the commuting graph of this semigroup construction to deduce results regarding the properties of commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups. We also characterize the graphs that arise as commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups. In the process of obtaining these results we are also able to restrict the possible values for some properties of commuting graphs of groups.</description>

      <title>Classifying Stein's groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of Stein's groups, which generalize the well-known Higman-Thompson groups. Stein's groups are defined as groups of piecewise linear bijections of an interval with finitely many breakpoints and slopes belonging to specified additive and multiplicative subgroups of the real numbers. Our main result establishes a classification theorem for these groups under the assumptions that the slope group is finitely generated and the additive group has rank at least 2. We achieve this by interpreting Stein's groups as topological full groups of ample groupoids. A central concept in our analysis is the notion of $H^1$-rigidity in the cohomology of groupoids. In the case where the rank of the additive group is 1, we adopt a different approach using attracting elements to impose strong constraints on the classification.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Foulkes characters of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article is concerned with the Foulkes characters of wreath products, which are block characters of wreath products, i.e., the positive-definite class functions depending only on the length of its elements. Inspired by the works of Gnedin--Gorin--Kerov and Miller, we introduce two specializations of the Schur--Weyl--Sergeev duality for wreath products and obtain two families of block characters, which provide a decomposition and an alternative construction of the Foulkes characters of wreath products. In particular, we give alternative proofs on some remarkable properties of the Foulkes characters. Along the way, we show that the Foulkes characters are the extreme rays of the cone of the block characters of wreath products and construct the representations with traces being the Foulkes characters via the coinvariant algebra of wreath products.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>Permutation clones that preserve relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation clones generalise permutation groups and clone theory. We investigate permutation clones defined by relations, or equivalently, the automorphism groups of powers of relations. We find many structural results on the lattice of all relationally defined permutation clones on a finite set. We find all relationally defined permutation clones on two element set.
  We show that all maximal borrow closed permutation clones are either relationally defined or cancellatively defined.
  Permutation clones generalise clones to permutations of $A^n$. Emil Je\v{r}\'{a}bek found the dual structure to be weight mappings $A^k\rightarrow M$ to a commutative monoid, generalising relations. We investigate the case when the dual object is precisely a relation, equivalently, that $M={\mathbb B}$, calling these relationally defined permutation clones.
  We determine the number of relationally defined permutation clones on two elements (13).
  We note that many infinite classes of clones collapse when looked at as permutation clones.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this short note is to completely answer Questions 2.34 and 2.35 of arXiv:1806.01127. In particular, we show that a finite strong-nil skew brace $B$ of abelian type need not be right-nilpotent, but that this is the case if~$B$ is of nilpotent type and $b\ast b=0$ for all $b\in B$ (our examples show that this is the best possible result).</description>

      <title>On finite permutation groups of rank three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of the finite primitive permutation groups of rank $3$ was completed in the 1980s and this landmark achievement has found a wide range of applications. In the general transitive setting, a classical result of Higman shows that every finite imprimitive rank $3$ permutation group $G$ has a unique non-trivial block system $\mathcal{B}$ and this provides a natural way to partition the analysis of these groups. Indeed, the induced permutation group $G^{\mathcal{B}}$ is $2$-transitive and one can also show that the action induced on each block in $\mathcal{B}$ is also $2$-transitive (and so both induced groups are either affine or almost simple). In this paper, we make progress towards a classification of the rank $3$ imprimitive groups by studying the case where the induced action of $G$ on a block in $\mathcal{B}$ is of affine type. Our main theorem divides these rank $3$ groups into four classes, which are defined in terms of the kernel of the action of $G$ on $\mathcal{B}$. In particular, we completely determine the rank $3$ semiprimitive groups for which $G^{\mathcal{B}}$ is almost simple, extending recent work of Baykalov, Devillers and Praeger. We also prove that if $G$ is rank $3$ semiprimitive and $G^{\mathcal{B}}$ is affine, then $G$ has a regular normal subgroup which is a special $p$-group for some prime $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon previous results, a classification is given of finite $p$-groups of which subgroups of order $p$ are all fused. This completes the classification problem dated back to Higman 1963 on the so-called Suzuki $2$-groups, and confirms a conjecture of Gross proposed in 1974. As a consequence, two open problems on AT-groups and FIF-groups are solved.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. For all but finitely many $m\in \mathbb{N}$, we exhibit the first examples of non-locally rigid, Zariski dense, robust quasi-isometric embeddings of hyperbolic groups in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{K})$ which are not limits of Anosov representations. As a consequence, we show that higher rank analogues of Sullivan's structural stabilty theorem and of the density theorem for Kleinian groups fail for Anosov representations in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{C}), m\geq 30$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the class of all left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal. We call them Dedekind left braces. It is proved that every finite Dedekind left brace is centrally nilpotent. Structural results about Dedekind left braces and a complete description of those ones whose additive group is elementary abelian are also shown. As a consequence, every hypermultipermutational Dedekind left brace whose additive group is elementary abelian is multipermutational of level $2$. A new class of left braces, the extraspecial left braces, is introduced and plays a prominent role in our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study of the perfect kernel of the space of transitive actions of Baumslag-Solitar groups by investigating high transitivity. We show that actions of finite phenotype are never highly transitive, except when the phenotype is 1, in which case high transitivity is actually generic. In infinite phenotype, high transitivity is generic, except when |m|=|n| where it is empty. We also reinforce the dynamical properties of the action by conjugation on the perfect kernel that we had established in our first paper, replacing topological transitivity by high topological transitivity.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterization of quaternionic positive definite functions on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the spectral characteristics of quaternionic positive definite functions on the real line. We generalize the Stone's theorem to the case of a right quaternionic linear one-parameter unitary group via two different types of functional calculus. From the generalized Stone's theorems we obtain a correspondence between continuous quaternionic positive definite functions and spectral systems, i.e., unions of a spectral measure and a unitary anti-self-adjoint operator that commute with each other; and then deduce that the Fourier transform of a continuous quaternionic positive definite function is an unusual type of quaternion-valued measure which can be described equivalently in two different ways. One is related to spectral systems (induced by the first generalized Stone's theorem), the other is related to non-negative finite Borel measures (induced by the second generalized Stone's theorem). An application to weakly stationary quaternionic random processes is also presented.</description>

      <title>Covers and pseudocovers of symmetric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudocover, which is a counterpart of cover, for symmetric graphs. The only known example of pseudocovers of symmetric graphs so far was given by Praeger, Zhou and the first-named author a decade ago, which seems technical and hard to extend to obtain more examples. In this paper, we present a criterion for a symmetric extender of a symmetric graph to be a pseudocover, and then apply it to produce various examples of pseudocovers, including (1) with a single exception, each Praeger-Xu's graph is a pseudocover of a wreath graph; (2) each connected tetravalent symmetric graph with vertex stabilizer of size divisible by $32$ has connected pseudocovers.</description>

      <title>Marked Length Spectrum Rigidity for Surface Amalgams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that simple, thick negatively curved two-dimensional P-manifolds, a large class of surface amalgams, are marked length spectrum rigid. That is, if two piecewise negatively curved Riemannian metrics (satisfying certain smoothness conditions) on a simple, thick two-dimensional P-manifold assign the same lengths to all closed geodesics, then they differ by an isometry up to isotopy. Our main theorem is a natural generalization of Croke and Otal's celebrated results about marked length spectrum rigidity of negatively curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>Profinite almost rigidity in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any compact, orientable 3-manifold with empty or toral boundary is profinitely almost rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds, i.e. the profinite completion of its fundamental group determines its homeomorphism type to finitely many possibilities. Moreover, the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a mixed 3-manifold, together with the peripheral structure, uniquely determines the homeomorphism type of its Seifert part (i.e. the maximal graph manifold components in the JSJ-decomposition). On the other hand, without assigning the peripheral structure, the profinite completion of a mixed 3-manifold group may not even determine the fundamental group of its Seifert part. The proof is based on JSJ-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Loops, Holonomy and Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a topology on the group of loops in euclidean space such that this group is embedded in a Lie group which is simple relative to the loops. An extension of this Lie group gives the structural group of a principal bundle with connection whose holonomy coincides with the Chen signature map. We also give an alternative geometric new proof of Chen signature Theorem.</description>
