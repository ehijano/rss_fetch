      <title>A Green Solution for Breast Region Segmentation Using Deep Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Annotation of medical breast images is an essential step toward better diagnostic but a time consuming task. This research aims to focus on different selecting sample strategies within deep active learning on Breast Region Segmentation (BRS) to lessen computational cost of training and effective use of resources.
  Methods: The Stavanger breast MRI dataset containing 59 patients was used in this study, with FCN-ResNet50 adopted as a sustainable deep learning (DL) model. A novel sample selection approach based on Breast Anatomy Geometry (BAG) analysis was introduced to group data with similar informative features for DL. Patient positioning and Breast Size were considered the key selection criteria in this process. Four selection strategies including Random Selection, Nearest Point, Breast Size, and a hybrid of all three strategies were evaluated using an active learning framework. Four training data proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% were used for model training, with the remaining data reserved for testing. Model performance was assessed using Dice score, Intersection over Union, precision, and recall, along with 5-fold cross-validation to enhance generalizability.
  Results: Increasing the training data proportion from 10% to 40% improved segmentation performance for nearly all strategies, except for Random Selection. The Nearest Point strategy consistently achieved the lowest carbon footprint at 30% and 40% data proportions. Overall, combining the Nearest Point strategy with 30% of the training data provided the best balance between segmentation performance, efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

      <title>Finite Element Simulation of NMC Particle Fracture during Calendering: a Route to Optimize Electrode Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond active material intrinsic properties, the electrode manufacturing process is a crucial step to reach high energy density and long-life of Li-ion batteries. In particular, very high pressures are applied to the electrode during the calendering step, that directly influence the microstructure and the electrochemical performances. This article reports the first calendering simulation of a NMC cathode using a finite element method (FEM), including the post-fracturation behaviour of the secondary NMC particles. Calibrated with nano-indentation experiments, the mechanical model provides stress-strain predictions fully consistent with experimental data. On assemblies up to 100 particles, simulations reveal three calendering regimes along compression: particle rearrangement, moderatepressure fracturing, and complete crushing. The model shows the strong sensitivity of the electrode microstructure to the calendering pressure level, and can thus be used as a guidance in the multi-criteria optimization of the manufacturing process.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of the positronium lifetime imaging with the Biograph Vision Quadra and J-PET tomographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: After its first ex-vivo and in-vivo demonstration, Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI) has received considerable interest as a potential new diagnostic biomarker. High sensitivity Positron Emission Tomography (PET) systems are needed for PLI since it requires simultaneous registration of annihilation photons and prompt gamma. In this simulation-based study, a~feasibility of PLI with the long axial field-of-view Biograph Vision Quadra (Quadra) and the Total Body J-PET scanner was investigated.
  Methods: The study was performed using the GATE software. Background radiation, present within the Quadra tomograph, was added to the simulation. First, the optimal placement of the energy window for the registration of the prompt gamma was investigated. Next, the organ-wise sensitivity of Quadra was calculated for the $^{68}$Ga, $^{44}$Sc, $^{22}$Na and $^{124}$I radioisotopes. Finally, the sensitivity for the scandium isotope was compared to the sensitivities obtainable with the Total Body J-PET scanner, as well as with the modular J-PET prototype.
  Results: The PLI sensitivities for the Quadra with the background radiation are estimated to 9.22(3), 10.46(4), 5.91(3), and 15.39(4) cps/kBq for the $^{44}$Sc, $^{68}$Ga, $^{22}$Na and $^{124}$I radioisotopes, respectively. The highest sensitivity was obtained when the energy window for the deexcitation photon is adjacent to the energy window for the annihilation photons. The determined PLI sensitivities with Quadra and the Total Body J-PET are in the order of sensitivities of standard PET imaging with the short axial field-of-view ($\sim$20 cm) PET scanners.
  Conclusion: The organ-wise PLI sensitivity of Quadra has been computed for the $^{68}$Ga, $^{44}$Sc, $^{22}$Na and $^{124}$I radioisotopes. A sensitivity gain by a factor of 150 was estimated relative to the modular J-PET system previously used for the first in-vivo PLI.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Coil Matching Toolbox for Magnetic Stimulation and Other Electromagnetics (COMATOSE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coil in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) determines the spatial shape of the electromagnetic field in the head, which structures are concurrently activated, and how focal stimulation is. Most of the readily available coils have been designed intuitively instead of systematic mathematical-physical optimization as there were no methods available at the time. Previous research however demonstrated that these coils are far from optimum, e.g., for pulse energy or efficiency, and leave substantial room for lots of improvements. Techniques for rigorous mathematical optimization have been developed but are only available to very few groups worldwide. This paper presents an open-source toolbox, COMATOSE, to change that situation and make these methods available to a wider community. It incorporates the fundamental formalisms and offers vector space decomposition as well as base mapping as an explicit forward method, which is computationally less demanding than iterative computational optimization but can also form the initial solution for a subsequent optimization run if desired.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electric Charge on Biotherapeutic Transport, Binding and Absorption: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of electric charge on the dynamics of drug transport and absorption in subcutaneous injections of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We develop a novel mathematical and computational model, based on the Nernst-Planck equations and porous media flow theory, to investigate the complex interactions between mAbs and charged species in subcutaneous tissue. The model enables us to study short-term transport dynamics and long-term binding and absorption for two mAbs with different electric properties. We examine the influence of buffer pH, body mass index, injection depth, and formulation concentration on drug distribution and compare our numerical results with experimental data from the literature.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Modeling of the Anode Heel Effect in X-ray Beam Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To develop a machine learning-based framework for accurately modeling the anode heel effect in Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray imaging systems, enabling realistic beam intensity profiles with minimal experimental calibration. Multiple regression models were trained to predict spatial intensity variations along the anode-cathode axis using experimentally acquired weights derived from beam measurements across different tube potentials. These weights captured the asymmetry introduced by the anode heel effect. A systematic fine-tuning protocol was established to minimize the number of required measurements while preserving model accuracy. The models were implemented in the OpenGATE 10 and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits to evaluate their integration feasibility and predictive performance. Among the tested models, gradient boosting regression (GBR) delivered the highest accuracy, with prediction errors remaining below 5% across all energy levels. The optimized fine-tuning strategy required only six detector positions per energy level, reducing measurement effort by 65%. The maximum error introduced through this fine-tuning process remained below 2%. Dose actor comparisons within Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the GBR-based model closely replicated clinical beam profiles and significantly outperformed conventional symmetric beam models. This study presents a robust and generalizable method for incorporating the anode heel effect into Monte Carlo simulations using machine learning. By enabling accurate, energy-dependent beam modeling with limited calibration data, the approach enhances simulation realism for applications in clinical dosimetry, image quality assessment, and radiation protection.</description>
