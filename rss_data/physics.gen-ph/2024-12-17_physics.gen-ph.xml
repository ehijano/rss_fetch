      <title>A Version of Exclusively Perturbative Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a version of renormalizable Quantum Field Theory which does not contain non-perturbative effects. This is otained by the proper use of the boundary conditions in the functional integral of the generating functional of Green functions. It is well known which boundary conditions are applied to the fields of the functional integral to get correct perturbation theory. We propose that these conditions should be used for all fields integrated in the generating functional integral. It is shown that in this case non-perturbative effects are absent. That is we assume that perturbation theory defines the complete generating functional integral. It allows, in particular, to formulate the generating functional integral in a unique way as an exact compact mathematical formula.</description>

      <title>Spin Theory Based on the Extended Least Action Principle and Information Metrics: Quantization, Entanglement, and Bell Test With Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory of electron spin is developed here based on the extended least action principle and assumptions of intrinsic angular momentum of an electron with random orientations. The novelty of the formulation is the introduction of relative entropy for the random orientations of intrinsic angular momentum when extremizing the total actions. Applying recursively this extended least action principle, we show that the quantization of electron spin is a mathematical consequence when the order of relative entropy approaches a limit. In addition, the formulation of the measurement probability when a second Stern-Gerlach apparatus is rotated relative to the first Stern-Gerlach apparatus, and the Schr\"{o}dinger-Pauli equation, are recovered successfully. Furthermore, the principle allows us to provide an intuitive physical model and formulation to explain the entanglement phenomenon between two electron spins. In this model, spin entanglement is the consequence of the correlation between the random orientations of the intrinsic angular momenta of the two electrons. Since spin orientation is an intrinsic local property of the electron, the correlation of spin orientations can be preserved and manifested even when the two electrons are remotely separated. The entanglement of a spin singlet state is represented by two joint probability density functions that reflect the orientation correlation. Using these joint probability density functions, we prove that the Bell-CHSH inequality is violated in a Bell test. To test the validity of the spin-entanglement model, a Bell test experiment with time delay is proposed. As the time delay increases, we predict that the Bell-CHSH inequality changes from being violated to non-violated.</description>

      <title>Effects of external gravitational field on highly rarefied gases: Analysis based on stochastic soft-sphere collision models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the effects of an external gravitational field on highly rarefied gases in the transitional-flow regime near the free-molecular-flow regime. In our theoretical study, we rederive the classical kinetic theory for an ideal gas in terms of the kinetics of the constituent particles to account for the effect of particle acceleration by an external gravitational field. Subsequently, we derive an extended expression for the virial pressure equation as a generic description of the dynamics under an external gravitational field. We employ the soft-sphere model for the following reasons: In highly rarefied gases, short-range and instantaneous collisional interactions are dominant. Thus, by expanding the asymmetric two-body potential in the virial pressure equation and retaining only the contribution of the short-range interaction, we can obtain a soft-sphere model that represents the interaction in the collision direction as a harmonic oscillation. In the absence of dissipation, the softsphere model has been confirmed to reproduce fully elastic collisions. In our collision simulations, we define two parameters. The first parameter represents the collision probability between each pair of approaching particles, and the second represents the ratio of the magnitude of the external potential energy to the total kinetic energy of the particles. The behavior of the system is analyzed by varying the values of these two parameters. Our analysis shows that if the external potential energy is sufficiently small (1 %-5 %) compared with the total kinetic energy, then a pressure difference emerges between the walls. However, the system retains the properties of equilibrium statistical mechanics, as indicated by the Maxwell--Boltzmann (MB) distribution. In conclusion, highly rarefied gases obey the MB distribution even when placed under weak gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Tsallis-Cirto entropy of black hole and black hole atom</title>

Abstract: The quantum tunneling processes related to the black hole determine the black hole thermodynamics. The Hawking temperature is determined by the quantum tunneling processes of radiation of particles from the black hole. On the other hand, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole is obtained by consideration of the macroscopic quantum tunneling processes of splitting of black hole to the smaller black holes. These tunneling processes also determine the composition rule for the black hole entropy, which coincides with the composition rule for the nonextensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ entropy. This composition rule suggests that the mass spectrum of the black hole is equidistant, $M=NM_0$. Here $N$ is an integer number and $M_0=\sqrt{2}m_{\rm P}$ is the mass quantum expressed via the reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}$. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole with mass $M=NM_0$ is $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N^2$.</description>
