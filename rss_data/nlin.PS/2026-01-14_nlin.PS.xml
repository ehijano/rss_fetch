      <title>Geometric Spin Rotation in Triangular Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a geometric phenomenon in which a traveling wave made of degenerate Goldstone modes leaves behind a transformed ground state. In a triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet, a pulse of circularly polarized spin waves rotates the spins within their plane. An exact solution of the nonlinear equations of motion demonstrates that the accumulated rotation is a geometric phase related to parallel transport of the order parameter. We point out a curious analogy between the motion of the magnetic order parameter and that of a wobbling coin. This phenomenon opens a new route for controlling antiferromagnetic order by spin waves and may extend to other frustrated magnets as well as other physical systems with noncommuting broken-symmetry generators.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves in extended Gross-Pitaevskii Models with a Lee-Huang-Yang correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Optical Entropy and Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>
