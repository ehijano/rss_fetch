      <title>Stable Adams operations on $RO(C_2)$-graded homotopy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $C_2$-spectrum of Atiyah's Real $K$-theory is denoted by $\mathbf{KR}$ and the $C_2$-spectrum of topological modular forms of level structure $\Gamma_1(3)$ by $\mathbf{TMF}_1(3)$. In this short note we compute the $C_2$-equivariant stable Adams operations on the $RO(C_2)$-graded homotopy groups of $\mathbf{KR}$ and $\mathbf{TMF}_1(3)$.</description>

      <title>Twisted homological stability for handlebody mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove twisted homological stability for handlebody mapping class groups. Using the categorical framework developed by Randal-Williams and Wahl, we establish that the homology of the handlebody groups stabilises with respect to both genus and the number of marked boundary discs, for all coefficient systems of finite degree. Our first main theorem refines and extends the twisted stability result for handlebodies outlined by Randal-Williams and Wahl, allowing any number of marked discs and boundary points. We then introduce the notion of coefficient bisystem to treat stability under variation of boundary markings. As an application, we deduce homological stability for moduli spaces of 3-dimensional handlebodies equipped with tangential structures.</description>

      <title>Products of Chern Classes and Chern Numbers on the Permutohedral Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A root system $\Phi$ of rank $n$ determines an $n$-dimensional smooth projective toric variety $X(\Phi)$ associated with the fan of its Weyl chambers. For the root system of type $A_n$, this variety is the well-known permutohedral variety $X_{A_n}$. Using purely combinatorial methods, we obtain an explicit closed formula expressing the product of Chern classes $c_k c_{n-k}$ as a multiple of the top Chern class $c_n$ in the rational cohomology ring $H^*(X_{A_n};\mathbb{Q})$. The resulting coefficient, which depends only on $k$ and $n$, is given by a closed-form expression. As an application, we compute the Chern number $\langle c_k c_{n-k}, [X_{A_n}] \rangle$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we record the proof of a theorem about the coincidence of genuine and homotopy fixed points for isometric group actions on complete Riemannian manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature, and more generally, certain quotients of universal spaces for families. The result is put into context with the Nielsen realisation problem for aspherical manifolds, and we give a unifying account of different formulations of that problem, made possible by the same methods.</description>

      <title>Relative $\mathbb{A}^1$-Contractibility of Koras-Russell Prototypes and Exotic Motivic Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koras-Russell threefolds are a certain family of smooth, affine contractible threefolds exhibiting "exotic" behavior in the algebro-geometric context. Our goal in this note is to extend its $\mathbb{A}^1$-contractibility from a field to a general base scheme. As a consequence, we also give a general strategy to extend the $\mathbb{A}^1$-contractibility of Koras-Russell prototypes in higher dimensions over a general base scheme. As a major consequence, we establish the existence of "exotic" motivic spheres in all dimensions at least 4 over infinite perfect fields.</description>

      <title>Simple homotopy types of even dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a closed $n$-manifold, we consider the set of simple homotopy types of $n$-manifolds within its homotopy type, called its simple homotopy manifold set. We characterise it in terms of algebraic K-theory, the surgery obstruction map, and the homotopy automorphisms of the manifold. We use this to construct the first examples, for all $n \ge 4$ even, of closed $n$-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent. In fact, we construct infinite families of manifolds that are all homotopy equivalent but pairwise not simple homotopy equivalent, and our examples can be taken to be smooth for $n \geq 6$.
  Our examples are homotopy equivalent to the product of a circle and a lens space. We analyse the simple homotopy manifold sets of these manifolds, determining exactly when they are trivial, finite, or infinite, and investigating their asymptotic behaviour. The proofs involve integral representation theory and class numbers of cyclotomic fields. We also compare with the relation of $h$-cobordism, and produce similar detailed quantitative descriptions of the manifold sets that arise.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Modular Functors via Factorization Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular functors are traditionally defined as systems of projective representations of mapping class groups of surfaces that are compatible with gluing. They can formally be described as modular algebras over central extensions of the modular surface operad, with the values of the algebra lying in a suitable symmetric monoidal $(2,1)$-category $\mathcal{S}$ of linear categories. In this paper, we prove that modular functors in $\mathcal{S}$ are equivalent to self-dual balanced braided algebras $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{S}$ (a categorification of the notion of a commutative Frobenius algebra) for which a condition formulated in terms of factorization homology with coefficients in $\mathcal{A}$ is satisfied; we call such $\mathcal{A}$ connected. The equivalence in one direction is afforded by genus zero restriction. Our construction of the inverse equivalence is entirely topological and can be thought of as a far reaching generalization of the construction of modular functors from skein theory. In order to verify the connectedness condition in practice, we prove that it can be reduced to a single condition in genus one. Moreover, we show that cofactorizability of $\mathcal{A}$, a condition known to be satisfied for modular categories, is sufficient. Therefore, we recover in particular Lyubashenko's construction of a modular functor from a (not necessarily semisimple) modular category and show that it is determined by its genus zero part. Additionally, we exhibit modular functors that do not come from modular categories and outline applications to the theory of vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>On the topology of real algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by questions arising in the theory of moduli spaces in real algebraic geometry, we develop a range of methods to study the topology of the real locus of a Deligne-Mumford stack over the real numbers. As an application, we verify in several cases the Smith-Thom type inequality for stacks that we conjectured in an earlier work. This requires combining techniques from group theory, algebraic geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rational motives over an arbitrary base scheme $S$ and identify a natural criterion guaranteeing that the principal models of rational motives agree. Starting from the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linearization $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ of the motivic sphere spectrum and from the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf H\mathbb{Q}$ built from rational finite correspondences, we analyse the canonical ring map $\Phi_S:\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]\to\mathbf H\mathbb{Q}$. Our first main result shows that $\Phi_S$ is a stable motivic equivalence as soon as motivic cohomology groups computed in Ayoub's framework agree, for all smooth $S$-schemes $X$ of finite type and all bidegrees, with those computed in Voevodsky's (Nisnevich) theory. From this identification of stable homotopy sheaves we deduce several consequences: for every excellent geometrically unibranch base the map $\Phi_S$ is an equivalence; modules over $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ recover the usual Beilinson/Ayoub/Morel incarnations of rational motives; and under the hypothesis that $\Phi_-$ is an equivalence formation of $\mathbf H\mathbb{Q}$ commutes with base change. Our last results shows that if motivic rational homology Whitewhead theorem over $S$ is true, then $\Phi_S$ is a stable motivic equivalence.</description>
