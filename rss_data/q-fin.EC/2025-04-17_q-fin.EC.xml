      <title>Particle-Hole Creation in Condensed Matter: A Conceptual Framework for Modeling Money-Debt Dynamics in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework that models money-debt dynamics in economic systems through a direct analogy to particle-hole creation in condensed matter physics. In this formulation, issuing credit generates a symmetric pair-money as a particle-like excitation and debt as its hole-like counterpart-embedded within a monetary vacuum field. The model is formalized via a second-quantized Hamiltonian that incorporates time-dependent perturbations to represent real-world effects such as interest and profit, which drive asymmetry and systemic imbalance. This framework successfully captures both macroeconomic phenomena, including quantitative easing (QE) and gold-backed monetary regimes, and microeconomic credit creation, under a unified quantum-like formalism. In particular, QE is interpreted as generating entangled-like pairs of currency and bonds, exhibiting systemic correlations akin to nonlocal quantum interactions. Asset-backed systems, on the other hand, are modeled as coherent superpositions that collapse upon use. This approach provides physicists with a rigorous and intuitive toolset to analyze economic behavior using many-body theory, laying the groundwork for a new class of models in econophysics and interdisciplinary field analysis.</description>

      <title>Digital Adoption and Cyber Security: An Analysis of Canadian Businesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how Canadian firms balance the benefits of technology adoption against the rising risk of cyber security breaches. We merge data from the 2021 Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use and the 2021 Canadian Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime to investigate the trade-off firms face when adopting digital technologies to enhance productivity and efficiency, balanced against the potential increase in cyber security risk. The analysis explores the extent of digital technology adoption, differences across industries, the subsequent impacts on efficiency, and associated cyber security vulnerabilities. We build aggregate variables, such as the Business Digital Usage Score and a cyber security incidence variable to quantify each firm's digital engagement and cyber security risk. A survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator is employed, and a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models is introduced to identify the drivers of technological efficiency and cyber risk. The analysis reveals a digital divide linked to firm size, industry, and workforce composition. While rapid expansion of tools such as cloud services or artificial intelligence can raise efficiency, it simultaneously heightens exposure to cyber threats, particularly among larger enterprises.</description>

      <title>The Paradox of Professional Input: How Expert Collaboration with AI Systems Shapes Their Future Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective paper examines a fundamental paradox in the relationship between professional expertise and artificial intelligence: as domain experts increasingly collaborate with AI systems by externalizing their implicit knowledge, they potentially accelerate the automation of their own expertise. Through analysis of multiple professional contexts, we identify emerging patterns in human-AI collaboration and propose frameworks for professionals to navigate this evolving landscape. Drawing on research in knowledge management, expertise studies, human-computer interaction, and labor economics, we develop a nuanced understanding of how professional value may be preserved and transformed in an era of increasingly capable AI systems. Our analysis suggests that while the externalization of tacit knowledge presents certain risks to traditional professional roles, it also creates opportunities for the evolution of expertise and the emergence of new forms of professional value. We conclude with implications for professional education, organizational design, and policy development that can help ensure the codification of expert knowledge enhances rather than diminishes the value of human expertise.</description>

      <title>Quantifying walkable accessibility to urban services: An application to Florence, Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of quality of life in urban settings is increasingly associated to the accessibility of amenities within a short walking distance for residents. However, this narrative still requires thorough empirical investigation to evaluate the practical implications, benefits, and challenges. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for evaluating urban accessibility to services, with an application to the city of Florence, Italy. Our approach involves identifying the accessibility of essential services from residential buildings within a 10-minute walking distance, employing a rigorous spatial analysis process and open-source geospatial data. As a second contribution, we extend the concept of 10-minute accessibility within a network theory framework and apply a clustering algorithm to identify urban communities based on shared access to essential services. Finally, we explore the dimension of functional redundancy. Our proposed metrics represent a step forward towards an accurate assessment of the adherence to the 10-minute city model and offer a valuable tool for place-based policies aimed at addressing spatial disparities in urban development.</description>

      <title>Systemic risk mitigation in supply chains through network rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The networked nature of supply chains makes them susceptible to systemic risk, where local firm failures can propagate through firm interdependencies that can lead to cascading supply chain disruptions. The systemic risk of supply chains can be quantified and is closely related to the topology and dynamics of supply chain networks (SCN). How different network properties contribute to this risk remains unclear. Here, we ask whether systemic risk can be significantly reduced by strategically rewiring supplier-customer links. In doing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network structures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of fundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk through rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects firm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the national SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be considerably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of firms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals that this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in non-trivial ways. These results suggest that actual SCN topologies carry unnecessarily high levels of systemic risk. We discuss the possibility of devising policies to reduce systemic risk through minimal, targeted interventions in supply chain networks through market-based incentives.</description>

      <title>Energy Storage Autonomy in Renewable Energy Systems Through Hydrogen Salt Caverns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion of renewable energy sources leads to volatility in electricity generation within energy systems. Subsurface storage of hydrogen in salt caverns can play an important role in long-term energy storage, but their global potential is not fully understood. This study investigates the global status quo and how much hydrogen salt caverns can contribute to stabilizing future renewable energy systems. A global geological suitability and land eligibility analysis for salt cavern placement is conducted and compared with the derived long-term storage needs of renewable energy systems. Results show that hydrogen salt caverns can balance between 43% and 66% of the global electricity demand and exist in North America, Europe, China, and Australia. By sharing the salt cavern potential with neighboring countries, up to 85% of the global electricity demand can be stabilized by salt caverns. Therefore, global hydrogen can play a significant role in stabilizing renewable energy systems.</description>
