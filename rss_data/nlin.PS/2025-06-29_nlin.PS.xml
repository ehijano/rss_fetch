      <title>Pattern formation in a Swift-Hohenberg equation with spatially periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Swift-Hohenberg equation - a paradigm model for pattern formation - with "large" spatially periodic coefficients and find a Turing bifurcation that generates patterns whose leading order form is a Bloch wave modulated by solutions of a Ginzburg-Landau type equation. Since the interplay between forcing wavenumber and intrinsic wavenumber crucially shapes the spectrum and emerging patterns, we distinguish between resonant and non-resonant regimes. Extending earlier work that assumed asymptotically small coefficients, we tackle the more involved onset analysis produced by O(1) forcing and work directly in Bloch space, where the richer structure of the bifurcating solutions becomes apparent. This abstract framework is readily transferable to more complex systems, such as reaction-diffusion equations arising as dryland vegetation models, where topography induces spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Model-free Forecasting of Rogue Waves using Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated Reservoir Computing's capability to model various chaotic dynamical systems, yet its application to Hamiltonian systems remains relatively unexplored. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Reservoir Computing in capturing rogue wave dynamics from the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, a challenging Hamiltonian system with modulation instability. The model-free approach learns from breather simulations with five unstable modes. A properly tuned parallel Echo State Network can predict dynamics from two distinct testing datasets. The first set is a continuation of the training data, whereas the second set involves a higher-order breather. An investigation of the one-step prediction capability shows remarkable agreement between the testing data and the models. Furthermore, we show that the trained reservoir can predict the propagation of rogue waves over a relatively long prediction horizon, despite facing unseen dynamics. Finally, we introduce a method to significantly improve the Reservoir Computing prediction in autonomous mode, enhancing its long-term forecasting ability. These results advance the application of Reservoir Computing to spatio-temporal Hamiltonian systems and highlight the critical importance of phase space coverage in the design of training data.</description>

      <title>Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations seeded the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features, pointing towards future experimental probes of the less understood interaction-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Vegetation Patterning Can Both Impede and Trigger Critical Transitions from Savanna to Grassland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel ''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse.</description>
