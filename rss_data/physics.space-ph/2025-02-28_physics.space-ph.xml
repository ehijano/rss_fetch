      <title>Helium Abundance Periods Observed by the Solar Probe Cup on Parker Solar Probe: Encounters 1-14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19492</link>

Abstract: Parker Solar Probe is a mission designed to explore properties of the solar wind closer than ever before. Detailed particle observations from the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) have primarily focused on examining the proton population in the solar wind. However, several periods throughout the Parker mission have indicated that SPC has observed a pronounced and distinctive population of fully ionized helium, He$^{2+}$. Minor ions are imprinted with properties of the solar wind's source region, as well as mechanisms active during outflow, making them sensitive markers of its origin and formation at the Sun. Through a detailed analysis of the He$^{2+}$ velocity distributions functions, this work examines periods where significant and persistent He$^{2+}$ peaks are observed with SPC. We compute the helium abundance and examine the stream's bulk speed, density, temperature, magnetic field topology, and electron strahl properties to identify distinctive solar wind features that can provide insight to their solar source. We find that nearly all periods exhibit an elevated mean helium composition ($8.34\%$) compared to typical solar wind and a majority ($\sim87\%$) of these periods are connected to coronal mass ejections, with the highest abundance reaching $23.1\%$. The helium abundance and number of events increases as the solar cycle approaches maximum with a weak dependence on speed. Additionally, the events not associated with a CME are clustered near the heliospheric current sheet suggesting they are connected to streamer belt outflows. However, there are currently no theoretical explanations that fully describe the range of depleted and elevated helium abundances observed.</description>

      <title>New Models of Jupiter's Magnetopause and Bow Shock through the Juno Prime Mission: Probabilistic Location, Shape, and Internally-driven Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09186</link>

Abstract: The interaction between Jupiter's magnetosphere and the solar wind is not well-constrained: while internal energetic plasma processes are thought to dominate plasma circulation, the solar wind nonetheless exerts significant control over the shape and scale of the whole structure. To better constrain this interaction, we derive new functional forms for Jupiter's magnetopause and bow shock using data from the $Ulysses$, Galileo, Cassini, and Juno missions and calibrated solar wind estimates from the Multi-Model Ensemble System for the Heliosphere (MMESH). We design an empirical Bayesian model to estimate the locations of the boundaries using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, expanding our model to sample all times, not only boundary crossing events. The boundary surfaces which best describe the data are thus estimated without the need for a full, physics-based magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) treatment of the Jovian magnetosphere and the additional assumptions required for such. The new magnetopause model exhibits significant polar flattening and dawn-dusk asymmetry, and includes a narrowing of the magnetotail when compared to previous models. The new bow shock model is largely axisymmetric. Both boundary models describe surfaces which lie closer to Jupiter than previous models, which has important implications for the modern picture of Jupiter's dynamic magnetosphere and the expected science results of current and upcoming Jupiter-bound spacecraft. Applying these models to Juno's trajectory, we estimate that the spacecraft should be expected to spend ${\sim}19\%$ of each orbit in the magnetosheath and ${\sim}4\%$ of each orbit in the solar wind starting from Perijove 64 (PJ64, 21 July 2021).</description>
