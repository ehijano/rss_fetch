      <title>Natural Convection Heat Transfer from an Inclined Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation derives a novel formula predicting the natural convective heat transfer from an inclined cylinder given its length, diameter, inclination angle, Rayleigh number, and the fluid's Prandtl number and thermal conductivity.
  The present formula was tested with 93 inclined cylinder measurements having length-to-diameter ratios between 1.48 and 104 in nine data-sets from three peer-reviewed studies, yielding (data-set) root-mean-squared relative error values between 1.6% and 4.7%.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Complex Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MRPARCv2, Multi-resolution Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network, designed to model complex flows by embedding the structure of advection-diffusion-reaction equations and leveraging a multi-resolution architecture. MRPARCv2 introduces hierarchical discretization and cross-resolution feature communication to improve the accuracy and efficiency of flow simulations. We evaluate the model on a challenging 2D turbulent radiative layer dataset from The Well multi-physics benchmark repository and demonstrate significant improvements when compared to the single resolution baseline model, in both Variance Scaled Root Mean Squared Error and physics-driven metrics, including turbulent kinetic energy spectra and mass-temperature distributions. Despite having 30% fewer trainable parameters, MRPARCv2 outperforms its predecessor by up to 50% in roll-out prediction error and 86% in spectral error. A preliminary study on uncertainty quantification was performed, and we also analyzed the model's performance under different levels of abstractions of the flow, specifically on sampling subsets of field variables. We find that the absence of physical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) in the network architecture leads to degraded accuracy. A variable substitution experiment confirms that this issue persists regardless of which physical quantity is predicted directly. Our findings highlight the advantages of multi-resolution inductive bias for capturing multi-scale flow dynamics and suggest the need for future PIML models to embed EOS knowledge to enhance physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>From Time Series Expansion to Proper Generalized Decomposition via Graph-Theoretical Connection: Stabilized Simulation of Fluids Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ graph theory to establish a connection between the Time Series Expansion (TSE) and Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) methods. Using the concept of a directed graph, we demonstrate how one can transition from the computation of space modes in the TSE--first illustrated for the diffusion equation--to those of space modes in PGD, in which an inhomogeneous Volterra-type convolution recurrence relation, weighted by time-dependent coefficients, appears. This recurrence relation is simplified through graph-based analysis into a compact form using a simple path traversal, reducing the computational complexity. Moreover, the compact formulation reveals a natural stabilization process in the computation of space modes, where stabilized coefficients are automatically derived and can be used in the Stabilized-TSE (STSE) framework. To explicitly construct these coefficients, we consider a Simplified PGD (SPGD) formulation in which the time modes are chosen to be the time polynomial basis $t^n$. This choice yields a one-level Volterra-type recurrence relation that is similarly simplified using a simple path representation, demonstrating a connection in the computation of space modes from TSE, through STSE and SPGD, to PGD. This graph-based connection is exhibited in the case of inviscid flow to check how crucial the addition of an artificial diffusion is in stabilizing the recurrence formula of TSE. Finally, we extend the approach to the incompressible, dimensionless Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and build stabilization coefficients that depend on the Reynolds number Re, the space mode rank, and the simulation time step. Both the STSE and SPGD approaches are tested to simulate the wake behind a bluff body at Re = 5 000.</description>

      <title>Reynolds effects on transition to turbulence for hypersonic expansion and compression corner flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This experimental and numerical study examines transition to turbulence for a Cone-Cylinder-Flare geometry at Mach 7 and across a broad Reynolds number range. The focus is set on both attached boundary layers and separated shock-boundary layer interactions. The campaign is conducted in the R2Ch facility. Unsteady wall pressure fluctuations and high-speed schlieren images are analysed using data-driven techniques and compared with base flow computations and global linear stability analysis. The results distinguish two transition regimes. At high Reynolds numbers, transition is dominated by the second Mack mode and its non-linear interactions on the cone. High-frequency wall pressure measurements and schlieren imaging permit the capture of both fundamental waves and their non-linear harmonics. Non-linear interaction regions are resolved with unprecedented detail, clarifying the boundary-layer state before rapid breakdown at reattachment. At lower Reynolds numbers, the transition scenario is more intricate, marked by the coexistence of low- and high-frequency modes. A complex coupling between separated flow and convective instabilities is revealed, with trapped acoustic waves inside the recirculation region measured experimentally for the first time. Their linear origin is demonstrated through global stability analysis, and a simple acoustic duct model is provided to predict their frequencies. These waves offer a new interpretation of low-frequency pressure signatures and suggest a mechanism for energy transfer from high to low frequencies, ultimately driving transition on the flare. The findings advance understanding of hypersonic boundary-layer transition and its dependence on Reynolds number and flow separation.</description>

      <title>Model of incompressible turbulent flows via a kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic theory offers a promising alternative to conventional turbulence modelling by providing a mesoscopic perspective that naturally captures non-equilibrium physics such as non-Newtonian effects. In this work, we present an extension and theoretical analysis of the recent kinetic model for incompressible turbulent flows developed by Chen et al. (Atmos. 14(7), 1109, 2023), constructed for unbounded flows. The first extension is to reselect a relaxation time such that the turbulent transport coefficients are obtained more consistently and better align with well-established turbulence theory. The Chapman-Enskog (CE) analysis of the kinetic model reproduces the traditional linear eddy viscosity and gradient diffusion models for Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy flux at the first order, and yields nonlinear eddy viscosity and closure models at the second order. Particularly, a previously unreported CE solution for turbulent kinetic energy flux is obtained. The second extension is to enable the model for wall-bounded turbulent flows with preserved near-wall asymptotic behaviours. This involves developing a low-Reynolds number kinetic model incorporating wall damping effects and viscous diffusion, with boundary conditions enabling both viscous sublayer resolution and wall function application. Comprehensive validation against experimental and DNS data for turbulent plane Couette flow demonstrates excellent agreement in predicting mean velocity profiles, skin friction coefficients, and Reynolds stress distributions. It reveals that an averaged turbulent flow behaves similarly to a rarefied gas flow at a finite Knudsen number, capturing non-Newtonian effects inaccessible to linear eddy viscosity models. This kinetic model provides a physics-based foundation for turbulence modelling with reduced empirical dependence.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Bending in Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Characteristic Bending (CB) method, a general framework for advecting quantities under incompressible velocity fields. The method builds on standard semi-Lagrangian advection by interpreting the backward-in-time characteristic reconstruction as the construction of a reference map, a diffeomorphism between the current and initial geometries of the advected space. From this viewpoint, the CB method applies a volume-preserving projection to the map, systematically removing spurious compressible errors arising from time integration, interpolation, or from velocity fields that are only approximately divergence-free. This projection bends the characteristics toward the divergence-free space, preserving mass and geometric features of the advected fields, even in the presence of significant error. We demonstrate the method in both two and three dimensions using benchmark problems and for multiphase flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The results show that the CB method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional semi-Lagrangian schemes and as an augmentation of reference map formulations, offering improved robustness and accuracy in incompressible flow simulations.</description>

      <title>A Coupled CFD Framework for Combustor Turbine Interaction in a Research Aeroengine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fully coupled combustor turbine simulation framework applied to the MYTHOS aeroengine, developed within the Horizon Europe project MYTHOS, aimed at assessing the impact of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) and hydrogen on next generation propulsion systems. The numerical setup features a dynamic, bidirectional coupling between a pressure-based solver with detailed finite rate chemistry, deployed in the combustor, and a density-based turbomachinery solver employing tabulated thermochemistry for efficiency, used for the turbine. The coupling is realised through a flux-averaging methodology that ensures conservative exchange of flow quantities and allows flow in arbitrary directions across the interface. Previous validation steps of presented methodology have shown the viability of the approach and are also shortly reviewd. The paper focuses on the chemistry handling strategy that guarantees thermochemical consistency between the two solvers. Coupled reacting simulations at cruise operating conditions demonstrate the capability of the framework to capture combustor generated hot streaks transport and their influence on turbine aerothermal loading. Comparison with segregated simulations of the two components shows that coupling captures the highly unsteady temperature and flow distributions at the turbine inlet and across the blade rows. Whilst mean aerodynamic loading are essentially unchanged, a realistic circumferential variability in blade thermal loading can be observed in the coupled simulations, thus establishing a consistent foundation for future studies on the effects of alternative fuels on core engine components.</description>

      <title>Concentration Matters: Enhancing Particle Settling in Narrow Tilted Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles are known to sediment faster in containers with tilted walls than in vertical ones, a phenomenon known as the Boycott effect. In this work, we investigate how the tilt angle influences sedimentation in narrow channels across different particle volume fractions. Using particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, we reveal that there exists a concentration-dependent optimal tilt angle that maximizes sedimentation rates. Furthermore, at large tilt angles, the flow profiles across the channel deviate from the classical parabolic shape. We show that these non-parabolic profiles can be accurately captured by a one-dimensional Brinkman model, providing a predictive framework for understanding and tuning sedimentation in tilted geometries. Our findings demonstrate the potential to control and optimize particle settling by adjusting the channel tilt according to particle concentration, opening new possibilities for design in industrial and laboratory processes.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>

      <title>Half-explicit Runge-Kutta integrators for variational multiscale turbulence modeling: Toward higher-order accuracy in space and time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual-based variational multiscale (VMS) formulation has achieved remarkable success in large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows. However, its temporal discretization has largely remained limited to second-order implicit schemes. The present work aims at advancing this direction through the introduction of Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes within the VMS framework in a mathematically consistent manner. Guided by the Rothe method, the half-explicit RK scheme is employed as its accuracy is theoretically guaranteed for index-2 differential-algebraic equations. Owing to the explicit treatment of the nonlinear term, the resulting spatial problem exhibits a structure analogous to that of the Darcy equation. Following the philosophy of the VMS analysis, a subgrid-scale model is derived without invoking linearization based on perturbation series and related assumptions. The analysis further reveals that the parameter in the subgrid model is independent of the spatial mesh size. Fourier analysis demonstrates that the Rothe method, compared with the conventional vertical method of lines, provides improved dissipation and dispersion properties and exhibits a larger stability region for convection-dominated regimes. In the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, the proposed schemes demonstrate superior performance as a large-eddy simulation model, achieving higher fidelity in predicting the kinetic energy evolution, energy spectra, and vortex structures than the conventional VMS formulation. Simulations of the open cavity flow further show that the proposed schemes can accurately capture the periodic limit cycle caused by the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, confirming its effectiveness and fidelity for highly sensitive flow instability problems.</description>

      <title>Birth of a bubble: Drop impact onto a thin liquid film for an immiscible three-fluid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a drop impacts a solid substrate or a thin liquid film, a thin gas disc is entrapped due to surface tension, the gas disc retracts into one or several bubbles. While the evolution of the gas disc for impact on solid substrate or film of the same fluid as the drop have been largely studied, little is known on how it varies when the liquid of the film is different that of the drop. We study numerically the latter unexplored area, focussing on the contact between the drop and the film, leading to the formation of the air bubble. The volume of fluid method was adapted to three fluids in the framework of Basilisk solver. The numerical simulations show that the deformation of the liquid film due to the air cushioning plays a crucial role in the bubble entrapment. A new model for the contact time and the entrapment geometry was deduced from the case of the impact on a solid substrate. This was done by considering the deformation of the thin immiscible liquid layer during impact depending mainly on its thickness and viscosity. The lubrication of the gas layer was found to be the major effect governing the bubble entrapment. However the film viscosity was also identified as having a critical role in bubble formation and evolution; the magnitude of its influence was also quantified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare experiments and fully-resolved particle simulations designed to match the experimental conditions of a weakly inertial, neutrally buoyant, moderately oblate spheroid in shear flow under confinement. Experimental and numerical results are benchmarked against theory valid for asymptotically small particle Reynolds numbers and for unconfined systems. By considering the combined effects of confinement and inertia, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the time span of observation, we reconcile the findings of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that confinement significantly influences the orientational stability of log-rolling spheroids compared to weak inertia, with the primary consequence being a reduced drift rate towards the stable log-rolling orbit.</description>

      <title>The macroscopic contact angle of water on ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wettability quantifies the affinity of a liquid over a substrate, and determines whether the surface is repellent or not. When both the liquid and the solid phases are made of the same chemical substance and are at thermal equilibrium, complete wetting is expected in principle, as observed for instance with drops of molten metals spreading on their solid counterparts. However, this is not the case for water on ice. Although there is a growing consensus on the partial wetting of water on ice and several estimates available for the value of the associated contact angle, the question of whether these values correspond to the equilibrium angle without thermal effects is still open. In the present paper, we address this issue experimentally and demonstrate the existence of a macroscopic contact angle of water on ice using theoretical arguments. Indeed, when depositing water droplets on smooth ice layers with accurately controlled surface temperatures, we observe that spreading is unaffected by thermal effects and phase change close enough to the melting point. Whereas the short time \C{motion of the contact line} is driven by an inertial-capillary balance, the evolution towards equilibrium is described by a viscous-capillary dynamics and is therefore capillary - and not thermally - related. Moreover, we show that this contact angle remains constant for undercoolings below 1 K. This way, we show the existence of a non-zero equilibrium contact angle of water on ice, that it is very close to 12$^\circ$. We anticipate this key finding to significantly improve the understanding of capillary flows in the presence of phase change, which is especially useful in the context of ice morphogenesis and of glaciology, but also in the aim of developing numerical methods for resolving triple-line dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLI) on hypersonic cone step flows exhibit a range of intrinsic unsteady behaviors, from shear-layer oscillations to large-scale pulsations. This work investigates the unsteadiness in a cone-step geometry at Mach 6 under quiet flow conditions at different freestream Reynolds numbers using time-resolved Schlieren imaging and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). Experimental results are compared with high-fidelity axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations. Results demonstrate regime transition in the parameter space, across the unsteadiness boundary, all the way from shear-layer breakdown to shock system oscillations and ultimately to large-amplitude pulsations. The dominant mode in the experiments and the simulations corresponds to a Strouhal number St ~ 0.17 for small oscillations reducing to St ~ 0.13 for large pulsations. A detailed description of the unsteady shock dynamics, the instability of the shear layer during onset of unsteadiness and an analysis of the nonlinear limit cycle is presented.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-assisted airfoil optimization in rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With growing interest in space exploration, optimized airfoil design has become increasingly important. However, airfoil design in rarefied gas flows remains underexplored because solving the Boltzmann equation formulated in a six dimensional phase space is time consuming. To address this problem, a solver-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization framework for symmetric, thickness-only airfoils is developed. First, airfoils are parameterized using a class shape transformation that enforce geometric admissibility. Second, a Gaussian process expected improvement surrogate is coupled in batches to a fast converging, asymptotic preserving Boltzmann solver for sample efficient exploration. Drag minimizing airfoils are identified in a wide range of gas rarefaction. It is found that, at Mach numbers Ma=2 and 4, the streamwise force increases with the gas rarefaction and shifts from pressure dominated to shear dominated drag, while optimization reduces drag at all conditions. The benefit of optimization peaks in the weakly rarefied regime, about 30% at Ma=2 and 40 to 50% at Ma=4, and falls to a few percent in transition and free-molecular flow regimes. Drag decomposition shows that these gains come mainly from reduced pressure drag, with viscous drag almost unchanged. The optimal airfoils form a coherent rarefaction-aware family: they retain a smooth, single-peaked thickness profile, are aft-loaded at low gas rarefaction, and exhibit a forward shift of maximum thickness and thickness area toward mid-chord as gas rarefaction increases. These trends provide a physically interpretable map that narrows the design space.</description>

      <title>Shock trapping and inertial escape: Dust-particle clustering in compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and clustering of dust particles with inertia in shock-dominated compressible turbulence using the two-dimensional, stochastically forced Burgers equation. At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the velocity fluctuations in sedimenting suspensions of rigid fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use direct numerical simulations to investigate fluid-solid interactions in suspensions of rigid fibres settling under gravity in a quiescent fluid. The solid-to-fluid density ratio is $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while the Galileo number ($Ga$) and fibre concentration ($n\ell_f^3$) are varied over the ranges $Ga \in [180, 900]$ and $n\ell_f^3 \in [0.36, 23.15]$; $\ell_f$ denotes the fibre length and $n$ the number density. At high $Ga$ and/or low $n\ell_f^3$, fibres cluster into gravity-aligned streamers with elevated concentrations and enhanced settling velocities, disrupting the flow homogeneity. As $Ga$ increases and/or $n\ell_f^3$ decreases, the fluid-phase kinetic energy rises and the energy spectrum broadens, reflecting enhanced small-scale activity. The flow anisotropy is assessed by decomposing the energy spectrum into components aligned with and transverse to gravity. Vertical fluctuations are primarily driven by fluid-solid interactions, while transverse ones are maintained by pressure-strain effects that promote isotropy. With increasing $Ga$, nonlinear interactions become more prominent, producing a net forward energy cascade toward smaller scales, punctuated by localised backscatter events. Analysis of the local velocity gradient tensor reveals distinct flow topologies: at low $Ga$, the flow is dominated by axisymmetric compression and two-dimensional straining; at high $Ga$, regions of high fibre concentration are governed by two-dimensional strain, while voids are associated with axisymmetric extension. The fluid motion is predominantly extensional rather than rotational.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Study of the Effects of Leading-Edge Serration on a Two-Section Planar Wing in ground-effect at Low Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A preliminary study has been conducted on the effects of serration on the leading-edge of a two-element trapezoidal wing placed both out-of- and in-ground effect. Aerodynamic performance and flow behaviour were evaluated numerically and validated experimentally. Results indicate an increase in maximum lift coefficient and stall angle obtained implementing a serrated leading-edge geometry due to the flow being re-energized by the formation of a series of counter-rotating pairs of vortices.
  Results from the analysis of the wing in ground effect appear less well defined. Both leading-edge geometries -- straight and serrated -- show an increase in efficiency due to the proximity to the ground. The wing with the straight leading-edge geometry shows constant improvement up to stall, whilst numerical results show a significant decrease in lift performance at high angles of attack. This may be caused by the lower-fidelity numerical model implemented at higher angles of attack, thus yielding less accurate results.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in wave-induced microplastic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microplastics are transported by ocean surface waves in ways that depart significantly from the Stokes drift of fluid parcels, and accurate modeling of this transport requires accounting for forces beyond linear drag. Existing modeling of microplastic transport often neglect the Basset-Boussinesq history force, effectively limiting their use to the smallest particle sizes. Here, we extend the applicability of these models by implementing the history term with a multistep integration scheme, allowing us to capture the transport of larger microplastics in linear surface waves of arbitrary depth. We quantify when the Basset-Boussinesq history force significantly affects microplastic transport by surface gravity waves. We show that memory effects become the leading-order horizontal drag once $S=St/\gamma^2$ exceeds a critical value $S\approx 0.25$, where $St$ is the Stokes number and $\gamma$ is the density ratio of the particle and the fluid. The corresponding critical $St$ number is found to be a factor of about three smaller than that given by classical inertial estimates that neglect history effects. These results help provide regime maps that can be used to indicate when history effects can be safely neglected. Our simulations also reveal that history effects significantly increase horizontal transport distances and enhance orbit shearing of particle ensembles.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Fluid Simulations in Structured Domains Using the Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity fluid simulations are central to understanding transport phenomena, yet resolving large or geometrically complex systems remains computationally prohibitive with existing methods. Here we introduce a tensor-network formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method based on matrix product states (MPS), commonly known as a quantum-inspired approach, enabling compressed representations of structured flow fields with inherent error control. We demonstrate the generality of the method on flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing for the first time that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex, irregular domains. We show that in the presence of translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry, fluid states exhibit low effective complexity in MPS form, yielding compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fold catastrophe in breaking waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical-systems perspective on wave breaking for ideal incompressible free-surface flows. By tracking the most energetic hotspot on the wave surface, we find that near breaking the surface slope m evolves on a fast timescale governed by the small parameter epsilon = (partial_z u)^(-1), the inverse vertical velocity gradient at the hotspot, while the focusing parameter A = (U - Ce)/(U - Creq) varies slowly and adiabatically. Here U is the horizontal fluid velocity at the energetic point, Ce its propagation speed, and Creq the equivalent crest speed. This slow-fast structure reveals a fold catastrophe in the (m, A) space whose boundary forms the geometric skeleton organizing the dynamics near breaking. Finite-time blowup occurs when the trajectory crosses this boundary, marking the onset of breaking.
  The inception of breaking is further characterized by crossing the slope threshold theta* = arctan(sqrt(2) - 1) = 22.5 degrees. This critical angle marks the maximum anisotropy that can be sustained between the Hessians of the velocity and pressure fields, reflecting an imbalance between kinetic and potential energy fluxes. The anisotropy of the velocity Hessian also gives rise to the classical 30-degree slope observed at the inflection point of steep waves near breaking inception. The crest height is limited by the maximum excess of kinetic over potential energy that the flow can sustain, beyond which breaking becomes inevitable. Wave breaking can also be interpreted as a gravity analogue of a collapsing black hole, with apparent and event horizons representing the onset and inception of breaking.</description>

      <title>Integral constraints on the linear instability of stratified flow with planar shear at an arbitrary angle to the vertical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral constraints on the linear instability of stratified parallel flow with planar shear at an arbitrary angle to the vertical are derived using the analytical approach of Miles and Howard, for perturbations with 2D spatial structure, which are thought to be the most unstable. The general stability formulation reproduces the Miles-Howard stability criterion for vertical shear, but yields no stability condition for non-vertical shear, confirming expectations from earlier studies. This study also extends Howard's semicircle theorem to non-vertical planar shear, and derives a new expression for the upper bound of the instability growth rate (extending that obtained by Howard), which is consistent with published numerical results.</description>

Abstract: We present two promising applications of training machine learning models inside a differentiable astrophysical (magneto)hydrodynamics simulator. First, we address the problem of slow convergence in hydrodynamical simulations of wind-blown bubbles with radiative cooling. We demonstrate that a learned cooling function can recover high-resolution dynamics in low-resolution simulations. Secondly, we train a convolutional neural network to correct 2D magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a specific blast wave problem. These case studies pave the way for the principled application of more general machine learning models inside astrophysical simulators.

      <title>Neural reconstruction of 3D ocean wave hydrodynamics from camera sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of wave free surfaces and associated velocity fields is essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of ocean physics. To address the high computational cost of dense visual reconstruction in long-term ocean wave observation tasks and the challenges introduced by persistent visual occlusions, we propose an wave free surface visual reconstruction neural network, which is designed as an attention-augmented pyramid architecture tailored to the multi-scale and temporally continuous characteristics of wave motions. Using physics-based constraints, we perform time-resolved reconstruction of nonlinear 3D velocity fields from the evolving free-surface boundary. Experiments under real-sea conditions demonstrate millimetre-level wave elevation prediction in the central region, dominant-frequency errors below 0.01 Hz, precise estimation of high-frequency spectral power laws, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of nonlinear velocity fields, while enabling dense reconstruction of two million points in only 1.35 s. Built on a stereo-vision dataset, the model outperforms conventional visual reconstruction approaches and maintains strong generalization in occluded conditions, owing to its global multi-scale attention and its learned encoding of wave propagation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Protocol to evaluate the viscoelastic response of a polymer suspension to an active agent via oscillatory shear rheometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms inhabit viscoelastic environments, where their locomotion can deform polymers and trigger local complex viscoelastic responses. However, a systematic approach to quantify such responses remains lacking. Here, we propose a protocol that maps the shear effect induced by an active agent to oscillatory shear rheometry. The central idea is to establish a correspondence between the mean shear rate generated by swimming and that produced by an oscillating plate. In this mapping, the swimming velocity and active stress are translated into an effective oscillation frequency and strain amplitude. The resulting viscoelastic response can then be evaluated by standard oscillatory rheometry. The protocol is validated using lattice Boltzmann simulations of a squirmer embedded in polymer solutions. Our framework is generic and can be naturally extended to active microrheology, providing a pathway to quantify swimmer-induced viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>How do cold pools influence the size of tropical cyclone embryos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The size of tropical cyclone (TC) embryos is an essential predictor of TC genesis. Recent studies have identified cold pools and planetary rotation as factors that increase and decrease TC embryo size. While the planetary rotation effect has been depicted using a quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, the cold pool effect still lacks a theoretical model. This paper presents a cloud chain model to derive the length scale regarding the influence of cold pools on the TC embryo vortex. Within the model, the amount of rain evaporation during a single convective event determines the wind speed and humidity at the cold pool edge, influencing the amount of sub-cloud moisture convergence for the next-generation convection and, therefore, the intensity of the next-generation cold pool. A perturbation analysis shows that cold pools exhibit a nonlocal dependence on air-column humidity, with the influence range determined by the cold pool size and a convective memory weight. The memory weight relies on the sum of the contributions of mechanical lifting and thermodynamic forcing to convective initiation. A crucial parameter is the ratio of rain evaporation to surface evaporation in a cold pool. By coupling the cloud chain model with the QG equation, an analytical expression for the TC embryo size is obtained. The theory captures the trend but overestimates the TC embryo size in cloud-permitting simulations. The deviation might be due to the oversimplification in estimating the fractional contribution of cold pools to convective initiation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Invariant Manifolds and Flow Reversals in Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how symmetry, exact coherent structures (ECSs), and their invariant manifolds organize spontaneous flow reversals in a 2D active nematic confined to a periodic channel. In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a compact data-driven Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model for wind turbine wake prediction, built as an enhancement of the standard \(k\)-\(\varepsilon\) formulation. Several candidate models were discovered using the symbolic regression framework Sparse Regression of Turbulent Stress Anisotropy (SpaRTA), trained on a single Large Eddy Simulation (LES) dataset of a standalone wind turbine. The leading model was selected by prioritizing simplicity while maintaining reasonable accuracy, resulting in a novel linear eddy viscosity model. This selected leading model reduces eddy viscosity in high-shear regions, particularly in the wake, to limit turbulence mixing and delay wake recovery. This addresses a common shortcoming of the standard \(k\)-\(\varepsilon\) model, which tends to overpredict mixing, leading to unrealistically fast wake recovery. Moreover, the formulation of the leading model closely resembles that of the established \(k\)-\(\varepsilon\)-\(f_P\) model. Consistent with this resemblance, the leading and \(k\)-\(\varepsilon\)-\(f_P\) models show nearly identical performance in predicting velocity fields and power output, but they differ in their predictions of turbulent kinetic energy. In addition, the generalization capability of the leading model was assessed using three unseen six-turbine configurations with varying spacing and alignment. Despite being trained solely on a standalone turbine case, the model produced results comparable to LES data. These findings demonstrate that data-driven methods can yield interpretable, physically consistent RANS models that are competitive with traditional modeling approaches while maintaining simplicity and achieving generalizability.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Experimental Evaluation of Chip Evacuation and Lubricant Flow using Optimized Drill Heads for Ejector Deep Hole Drilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ejector deep hole drilling offers great potential to utilize the typical advantages of deep hole drilling processes on conventional machining centers in a cost-effective and resource-efficient manner. However, maintaining reliable chip evacuation and stable process conditions often relies on high flow volumes of metalworking fluid, resulting in considerable energy consumption in industrial settings. Therefore, to analyze the highly sophisticated chip evacuation dynamics of the process, two flow-optimized drill heads and a reference drill head were evaluated with smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation using experimentally obtained chip shapes. In addition, modified drill heads were additively manufactured and experimentally investigated to validate the numerical results and to determine the positive effect on the necessary fluid flow for a stable ejector drilling process. The modifications aim to improve chip evacuation by reducing vortex formation and optimizing flow conditions near the cutting zone. Therefore, the minimum volume flow required for a stable drilling process without chip clogging is reduced, leading to an energy-efficient sustainable ejector drilling process.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal wall pressure forecast of a rectangular cylinder with physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance. Wind tunnel testing was performed to collect wall pressures on two-dimensional rectangular cylinders using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found capable of forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy on the rectangular cylinder with side ratio 1.5. The comparison between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in statistical information and physical interpretation. It is also found that embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient b in the DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information, particularly, high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability. Last, the DeepUFNet is tested for generalization in unseen cases, rectangular cylinders with side ratio 4 and 3.75, and the model presents satisfactory generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Transition to the ultimat regime of turbulent convection in stratified inclined duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stratified inclined duct (SID) flow provides a canonical model for sustained, buoyancy-driven exchange between two reservoirs of different density, and emerges as a new paradigm in geophysical fluid dynamics. Yet, the flow dynamics remain unclear in the highly turbulent regime; laboratory experiments can access this regime but they lack resolution, while direct numerical simulations (DNS) at realistically high Prandtl number $\mathrm{Pr}=7$ (for heat in water) have not achieved sufficiently high Reynolds numbers $\mathrm{Re}$. We conduct three-dimensional DNS up to $\mathrm{Re}= 8000$ and observe the transition to the so-called ultimate regime of turbulent convection as evidenced by the Nusselt number scaling $\mathrm{Nu} \sim \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$, i.e., considerably enhanced transport. At the transition the shear Reynolds number, a key parameter characterizing boundary layer (BL) dynamics, exceeds the threshold range of 420 for turbulent kinetic BLs with the emergence of logarithmic velocity profiles. The nature of the transition towards ultimate SID flow is of nonlinear-normal nature, i.e., subcritical and hysteretic, as typical for the transition to fully turbulent shear flows. Our work connects SID flow with the broader class of wall-bounded turbulent convection flows and gives insight into mixing in the vigorously turbulent regimes in oceanography and industry.</description>

      <title>A flux bounce-back scheme for the filtered Spectral Element Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a spectral element lattice Boltzmann method (SELBM) with the flux bounce-back (FBB) scheme, to enable accurate simulations of single-phase fluid dynamics in unstructured mesh. We adopt an Eulerian description of the streaming process in place of the perfect shift in the regular LBM. The spectral element method is used to spatially discretize the convective term, while the strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method is used for time integration. To increase stability, we investigate the use of an explicit filter, particularly in the context of the sensitive double shear layer problem. The results indicate that by using the high-order polynomial, we can effectively eliminate the small vortices around the neck region. We introduce the flux bounce-back scheme to enable the current scheme to handle complex boundaries. The proposed scheme and flux boundary method are validated through benchmark simulations, including the unsteady Couette flow and the planar Poiseuille flow. Further validation is provided through the Taylor-Green vortex problem, demonstrating the accuracy and convergence of the scheme for isotropic turbulence. Finally, we consider a fully developed turbulent flow within a cylindrical pipe and correctly predict the turbulent boundary layer profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free or clamped edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.</description>

      <title>In vivo evidence of blood flow slippage: failure of the no-slip boundary condition assumption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assumption that blood adheres to vessel walls, the ``no-slip'' boundary condition, is an essential premise of cardiovascular fluid dynamics. Yet, whether it holds true \emph{in vivo} has not been established. Using 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging of the human thoracic aorta and modeling blood as a Navier--Stokes fluid, we quantify the velocity of blood at the wall. We find tangential wall velocities of about 30--80\% of the mean luminal velocity, providing clear evidence of blood slippage. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the no-slip condition does not apply to blood flow \emph{in vivo}. This finding challenges a fundamental assumption in cardiovascular modeling and directly affects key blood flow characteristics such as pressure drop, vorticity, wall shear stress, and energy dissipation, all of which play important roles across a wide range of cardiovascular conditions.</description>

      <title>Discrete Contact Angles and Electric Field Singularity in Electrowetting: A Multi-Scale Complex Potential Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study constructed a multi-scale theoretical framework to resolve the electric field singularity at the Triple Contact Point in electrowetting. Utilizing conformal transformation and complex analysis, we established the structure for both the global potential and local field solutions, complementing the analysis with numerical methods. Our primary finding is that the contact angle $\theta$ is not continuously adjustable but is restricted to a discrete set of values, constrained by the characteristic exponent $\lambda$. Analysis of the complex potential established $\text{Re}[\lambda] \ge 1$ as the critical condition for a non-singular electric field; conversely, singular solutions ($\text{Re}[\lambda] &lt; 1$) are localized exclusively in the acute-angle regime ($\theta &lt; \pi/2$). The high-order solution region exhibits a degeneracy phenomenon at specific angles, implying the local field structure is geometrically stable and universally applicable for a wide range of permittivity ratios $k$. Furthermore, we determined that the onset of electric field oscillation requires the simultaneous satisfaction of two critical conditions: the geometry must approach a flat boundary ($\theta \to \pi$) and the dielectric ratio must approach homogeneity ($k \to 1$). These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for designing non-singular electric fields and mitigating the common contact angle saturation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Large/small eddy simulations: A posteriori analysis in high Reynolds number isotropic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While direct numerical simulations (DNS) are the most accurate method for studying turbulence, their large computational cost restricts their use to idealized configurations and to Reynolds numbers well below those found in practical systems. A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility.</description>

      <title>A data-driven framework to identify restenosis-prone regions in femoral arteries from geometric and inflow waveform parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haemodynamic indices derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), such as Time-averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS) and Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), are closely associated with restenosis risk in Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). However, translating these insights into clinical practice may require computationally efficient approaches such as Reduced Order Model (ROM) or Machine Learning (ML). In this work, we developed an ML-ROM framework to predict critical, restenosis-prone, haemodynamic regions accounting for both vessel geometries and inlet flow waveforms. We generated 500 synthetic femoral-artery geometries parameterised by six geometric parameters, and created physiologically realistic inflow waveforms via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of patient data. CFD was used to obtain the Wall Shear Stress (WSS) distribution, from which TAWSS and OSI were computed. Critical regions were then defined by applying threshold-based criteria to the TAWSS and OSI. Four critical-region definitions were considered: two with vessel-specific relative thresholds (TAWSS&lt; 33rd percentile and OSI&gt; 66nd percentile) and two with absolute thresholds (TAWSS&lt; 0.5 Pa and OSI&gt; 0.2). Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was then applied to these high-dimensional critical-region data to obtain ROMs; These were then used to train ML models from which the critical region regions could be reconstructed. Three ML architectures were explored: a Fourier-based architecture, a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The Fourier models achieved the highest performance, with the median values of Balanced Accuracy (BA) exceeding 0.92 across all critical-region definitions. The ML-ROM framework also offered a substantial speed-up ratio, about nine orders of magnitude faster than traditional CFD.</description>

Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for producing monodisperse micro-scale emulsions in a rectangular container holding two stably stratified layers of immiscible liquids by applying horizontal vibration. This setup enables the excitation of a single line of ordered Faraday waves along each end wall when viscous forces dominate interfacial dynamics. Our experiments and theoretical modelling show that the critical non-dimensional acceleration for the breakup of the wave tips in a regular array of droplets scales as $N^{-1/2} \omega^{*3/2}$, where $N$ is the kinematic viscosity ratio and $\omega^{*}$ is the frequency of forcing on the viscous-capillary scale. The droplet diameter can be easily tuned by varying the forcing parameters, and the number of droplets generated per cycle is proportional to the width of the container.</description>

      <title>Space-time resonances in the spatiotemporal spectrum of nonlinear dispersive waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In weakly nonlinear dispersive wave systems, long-time dynamics are typically governed by time resonances, where wave phases evolve coherently due to exact frequency matching. Recent advances in spatio-temporal spectrum measurements, however, reveal prominent features that go beyond the predictions of time resonance theory. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to interpret these signatures by identifying and characterizing an alternative mechanism: space resonances. These arise when wave packets share the same group velocity and remain co-located, leading to long-lived interactions. We further show that gauge-breaking terms in the Hamiltonian give rise to space resonances supported on negative frequencies. By combining sea-surface elevation data, numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we derive the leading-order spatio-temporal spectrum for weakly interacting water waves, providing a unified explanation for its observed features.</description>

Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we construct a chiral model mapping overdamped agents to supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the sound radiation of shallow water flows. We show that disorder activates a topological heat pump driving an inverse cascade toward a negative-temperature Onsager dipole, unless arrested into a vortex glass by insufficient dispersion. This mapping identifies a universality class unifying active swarms with the statistical mechanics of classical inviscid fluids.</description>

      <title>A novel multiscale modelling for the hemodynamics in retinal microcirculation with an analytic solution for the capillary-tissue coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03446</link>

Abstract: Mathematical modelling of the microcirculatory hemodynamics in the retina is an essential tool for understanding various diseases of the retina, yet remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of the retinal vasculature and its coupling to surrounding tissue. To address this, we develop a multiscale model that couples retinal vasculature across scales with interstitial tissue. Our model combines the one-dimensional (1D) model for arteries and veins with the coupled Darcy equations for capillaries and tissue. The model uses an analytic solution for capillary-tissue coupled system that provides a simple interpretation of the results along with much faster computation. The analytic solution implies a dynamic coupling condition that links the capillary bed with upstream arterial and downstream venous flows. The model is mathematically robust, demonstrated through analysis of the solution's truncation error and convergence. Its predictive accuracy is verified against experimental data and other models, making it useful in interpreting experimental results. Finally, the role of various parameters in controlling retinal hemodynamics is explored.</description>
