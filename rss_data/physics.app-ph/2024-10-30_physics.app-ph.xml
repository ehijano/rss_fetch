      <title>Resolving thermal gradients and solidification velocities during laser melting of a refractory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, such as laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), can yield high-value parts with unique geometries and features, substantially reducing costs and enhancing performance. However, the material properties from L-PBF processes are highly sensitive to the laser processing conditions and the resulting dynamic temperature fields around the melt pool. In this study, we develop a methodology to measure thermal gradients, cooling rates, and solidification velocities during solidification of refractory alloy C103 using in situ high-speed infrared (IR) imaging with a high frame rate of approximately 15,000 frames per second (fps). Radiation intensity maps are converted to temperature maps by integrating thermal radiation over the wavelength range of the camera detector while also considering signal attenuation caused by optical parts. Using a simple method that assigns the liquidus temperature to the melt pool boundary identified ex situ, a scaling relationship between temperature and the IR signal was obtained. The spatial temperature gradients (dT/dx), heating/cooling rates (dT/dt), and solidification velocities (R) are resolved with sufficient temporal resolution under various laser processing conditions, and the resulting microstructures are analyzed, revealing epitaxial growth and nucleated grain growth. Thermal data shows that a decreasing temperature gradient and increasing solidification velocity from the edge to the center of the melt pool can induce a transition from epitaxial to equiaxed grain morphology, consistent with the previously reported columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) trend. The methodology presented can reduce the uncertainty and variability in AM and guide microstructure control during AM of metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck in the weak exchange coupled van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) refers to the creation of spin currents due to a temperature gradient in the magnetic materials or across magnet-normal metal interfaces, which can be electrically detected through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) when in contact with heavy metals. It offers fundamental insights into the magnetic properties of materials, including the magnetic phase transition, static magnetic order, and magnon excitations. However, the SSE in van der Waals antiferromagnet is still elusive, especially across the spin-flip transition. Here, we demonstrate the SSE in the weak exchange coupled van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS$_4$. The SSE increases as the magnetic field increases before the spin-flip transition due to the enhancement of the thermal spin current as a function of the applied field. A peak of SSE is observed at the spin-flip field, which is related to the magnon mode edges across the spin-flip field. Our results extend SSE research to van der Waals antiferromagnets and demonstrate an enhancement of SSE at the spin-flip transition.</description>

      <title>Large Orbital to Charge Conversion in Weak Spin Orbit Coupling Element Zr via Spin Orbital Pumping and Spin Orbital Seebeck Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of spin-orbital currents is crucial for advancing energy-efficient spintronic devices. Here, the intricate process involved in the generation and conversion of spin and orbital to charge currents in Zr(t=2, 3, 4.5, 6, &amp;10nm)/Co60Fe20B20(CFB), Zr/Pt/CFB, and Zr/Pt/CFB/Pt heterostructures are investigated using spin-orbital pumping ferromagnetic resonance and longitudinal spin-orbital Seebeck effect measurements. The moderate spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the CFB layer facilitates the simultaneous generation of spin and orbital currents, which are transferred into adjacent Zr and Pt layers. Different spin-orbital to charge current contributions, namely, Inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), Inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE), and Inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect (IOREE) are analyzed. Notably, introducing a single Pt layer increases the spin-orbital to charge current conversion via combined effects: ISHE in Pt, IOREE in Zr/Pt interface. An enhanced effective spin-orbital Hall angle ({\theta}_eff) of 0.120 {\pm} 0.004 is observed for Zr/Pt/CFB, compared to that of 0.065 {\pm} 0.002 for the Zr/CFB, and 0.077 {\pm} 0.003 for the Zr/Pt/CFB/Pt heterostructures. These findings provide new insights into orbital-moment dependent phenomena and offer promising avenues for developing advanced spintronic devices exploiting both spin and orbital degrees of freedom, even in materials with lower SOC.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Origin of Mysterious Luminescence peak at 3.45 eV in GaN Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for GaN Nanowires (NWs)-based optoelectronic devices has rapidly increased over the past few years due to its superior crystalline quality compare to their planar counterparts. However, NWs-based devices face significant challenges because of number of surface states, basal plane stacking faults and coalescence related defect states. While the origins of most of the defect states have been identified and mitigated using well-established methods, the origins of few defect states remain unknown, and thus their suppression methods have yet to be explored. One such defect state is the 3.45 eV luminescence peak, known as the UX-band. In this report, we have investigated the origin of this peak in NWs grown on a sapphire substrate by using Plasma Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PAMBE) tool. We have found that the defect states, generated due to oxygen incorporation, especially when the oxygen atoms substitute the Ga atoms, are the primary cause of this band. Actually the excitons are localized at this defect center and the radiative recombination of localized excitons gives the characteristic UX-band. By protecting the NWs from oxygen incorporation through AlN encapsulation process, we have completely suppressed the 3.45 eV peak and proved further that the peak is caused by oxygen induced defect states. Thus we have addressed an issue that persisted over the last three decades, potentially paving the way for efficiency improvements in optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin resonance without a spin: A microwave analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analog of nuclear magnetic resonance is realized in a microwave network with symplectic symmetry. The network consists of two identical subgraphs coupled by a pair of bonds with a length difference corresponding to a phase difference of $\pi$ for the waves traveling through the bonds. As a consequence all eigenvalues appear as Kramers doublets. Detuning the length difference from the $\pi$ condition Kramers degeneracy is lifted, which may be interpreted as a Zeeman splitting of a spin 1/2 in a magnetic field. The lengths of another pair of bonds are modulated periodically with frequencies of some 10 MHz by means of diodes, thus emulating a magnetic radiofrequency field. Features well-known from NMR such as the transition from the laboratory to the rotating frame, and Lorentzian shaped resonance curves can thus be realized.</description>

      <title>Cumulenic sp-carbon Atomic Wires Wrapped Polymers for Supercapacitor Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon atomic wires, a linear atomic chain of sp-carbon, is theoretically predicted to have around five times higher surface area than graphene, notable charge mobilities, as well as excellent optical and thermal properties. Despite these impressive properties, the properties of sp-carbon as an electrochemical energy-storage electrode have not been reported so far. Herein, we prepare solution processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulenic sp-carbon atomic wires embedded in a polymer matrix, in which sp-carbon atomic wires feature three cumulated carbon-carbon double bonds terminated at each end by two phenyl groups. Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy are used to confirm the presence and possible degradation of sp-carbons inside the polymeric matrix. Finally, we investigate the supercapacitor performance of cumulenic sp-carbon atomic wires embedded polymer in three aqueous mediums, namely 1M Na2SO4 (neutral), 1M H2SO4 (acidic), and 6M KOH (basic). The results suggest 6M KOH is the best electrolyte to obtain high charge-storage performance of device with areal capacitance of 2.4 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s, 85% cycle stability after 10000 charge-discharge cycles, and excellent frequency response.</description>

      <title>Low-density functionalized amorphous carbon nanofoam as binder-free Supercapacitor electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous carbon materials containing small domains of sp2-carbon with highly disordered structures are promising for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we synthesize amorphous carbon nanofoam with 98% volumetric void fraction and low mass density of around 30 mg/cm3 by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. With the unavoidable oxygen functional groups on the nanoporous surface, pristine and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofoams are directly grown on the desired substrate under background gas of Ar, N2 and N2-H2employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Among the background gases used in synthesis, the use of nitrogen yields nanofoam with higher thickness and more N-content with higher graphitic-N, which is correlated with plasma plume behaviour. From the test of amorphous carbon nanofoam supercapacitor device, nitrogenated amorphous carbon show a higher areal capacitance of 4.1 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s in aqueous electrolyte, a better capacitance retention at higher current, and excellent cycle stability (98%) over prolonged 10000 charge-discharge cycles are achieved for compared to pristine counterpart prepared under Ar background gas (2.7 mF/cm2 and cycle stability of 88%).</description>

      <title>In-situ Study of Understanding the Resistive Switching Mechanisms of Nitride-based Memristor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface-type resistive switching (RS) devices with lower operation current and more reliable switching repeatability exhibits great potential in the applications for data storage devices and ultra-low-energy computing. However, the working mechanism of such interface-type RS devices are much less studied compared to that of the filament-type devices, which hinders the design and application of the novel interface-type devices. In this work, we fabricate a metal/TiOx/TiN/Si (001) thin film memristor by using a one-step pulsed laser deposition. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and current-voltage (I-V) characteristic demonstrate that the device is switched between high resistive state (HRS) and low resistive state (LRS) in a bipolar fashion with sweeping the applied positive and negative voltages. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveal that the charged defects (such as oxygen vacancies) can migrate along the intrinsic grain boundaries of TiOx insulating phase under electric field without forming obvious conductive filaments, resulting in the modulation of Schottky barriers at the metal/semiconductor interfaces. The fundamental insights gained from this study presents a novel perspective on RS processes and opens up new technological opportunities for fabricating ultra-low-energy nitride-based memristive devices.</description>

      <title>Graphene calorimetric single-photon detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photon detectors (SPDs) are essential technology in quantum science, quantum network, biology, and advanced imaging. To detect the small quantum of energy carried in a photon, conventional SPDs rely on energy excitation across either a semiconductor bandgap or superconducting gap. While the energy gap suppresses the false-positive error, it also sets an energy scale that can limit the detection efficiency of lower energy photons and spectral bandwidth of the SPD. Here, we demonstrate an orthogonal approach to detect single near-infrared photons using graphene calorimeters. By exploiting the extremely low heat capacity of the pseudo-relativistic electrons in graphene near its charge neutrality point, we observe an electron temperature rise up to ~2 K using a hybrid Josephson junction. In this proof-of-principle experiment, we achieve an intrinsic quantum efficiency of 87% (75%) with dark count &lt; 1 per second (per hour) at operation temperatures as high as 1.2 K. Our results highlight the potential of electron calorimetric SPDs for detecting lower-energy photons from the mid-IR to microwave regimes, opening pathways to study space science in far-infrared regime, to search for dark matter axions, and to advance quantum technologies across a broader electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Towards Neural-Network-based optical temperature sensing of Semiconductor Membrane External Cavity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine-learning non-contact method to determine the temperature of a laser gain medium via its laser emission with a trained few-layer neural net model is presented. The training of the feed-forward Neural Network (NN) enables the prediction of the device's properties solely from spectral data, here recorded by visible-/nearinfrared-light compact micro-spectrometers for both a diode pump laser and optically-pumped gain membrane of a semiconductor disk laser. Fiber spectrometers are used for the acquisition of large quantities of labelled intensity data, which can afterwards be used for the prediction process. Such pretrained deep NNs enable a fast, reliable and easy way to infer the temperature of a laser system such as our Membrane External Cavity Laser, at a later monitoring stage without the need of additional optical diagnostics or read-out temperature sensors. With the miniature mobile spectrometer and the remote detection ability, the temperature inference capability can be adapted for various laser diodes using transfer learning methods with pretrained models. Here, mean-square-error values for the temperature inference corresponding to sub-percent accuracy of our sensor scheme are reached, while computational cost can be saved by reducing the network depth at the here displayed cost of accuracy, as appropriate for different application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable moir\'e superlattice potentials in twisted hexagonal boron nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an advanced atomically thin van der Waals interfacial ferroelectricity platform. Nanoscale periodic ferroelectric moir\'e domains with out-of-plane potentials in twisted hBN allow the hosting of remote Coulomb superlattice potentials to adjacent two-dimensional materials for tailoring strongly correlated properties. Therefore, the new strategies for engineering moir\'e length, angle, and potential strength are essential for developing programmable quantum materials and advanced twistronics applications devices. Here, we demonstrate the realization of twisted hBN-based moir\'e superlattice platforms and visualize the moir\'e domains and ferroelectric properties using Kelvin probe force microscopy. Also, we report the KPFM result of regular moir\'e superlattice in the large area. It offers the possibility to reproduce uniform moir\'e structures with precise control piezo stage stacking and heat annealing. We demonstrate the high tunability of twisted hBN moir\'e platforms and achieve cumulative multi-ferroelectric polarization and multi-level domains with multiple angle mismatched interfaces. Additionally, we observe the quasi-1D anisotropic moir\'e domains and show the highest resolution analysis of the local built-in strain between adjacent hBN layers compared to the conventional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate in-situ manipulation of moir\'e superlattice potential strength using femtosecond pulse laser irradiation, which results in the optical phonon-induced atomic displacement at the hBN moir\'e interfaces. Our results pave the way to develop precisely programmable moir\'e superlattice platforms and investigate strongly correlated physics in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>SLICES-PLUS: A Crystal Representation Leveraging Spatial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the realm of crystalline materials has witnessed a surge in the development of generative models, predominantly aimed at the inverse design of crystals with tailored physical properties. However, spatial symmetry, which serves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the design process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry, potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and generation have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES. Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical properties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot learning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of computational materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of excitons in the near ideal performance of perovskite light emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent reports indicate that perovskite based light emitting diodes (LEDs) have achieved an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32% - rather an internal quantum efficiency close to 100%. Much of this improved performance is attributed to the role of excitons. While the experimental trends are encouraging, the recombination parameters estimated through extensive curve-fitting of photoluminescence (PL) transients are often not amenable to reasonable interpretations. In view of the same, through a detailed analysis of free carrier - exciton dynamics in perovskite optoelectronic materials, here we identify a coherent scheme to unambiguously back extract the relevant parameters. The model predictions compare well with the recent experimental results on perovskite LEDs with record EQE thus quantifying the role of excitons. Importantly, this work identifies a physics aware scheme for the design of experiments tailored towards consistent exploration of underlying physical mechanisms and hence could enable a synergistic optimization of process technology and device performance.</description>

      <title>3D Printable Plasmonic Titanium Nitride Nanoparticles Enhanced Thermoplastic Polyurethane Composite for Improved Photothermal De-Icing and Infrared Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanomaterials offer a direct and effective approach to harnessing solar energy. Specifically, plasmonic semiconductors enable a highly efficient light-to-heat conversion process, outperforming noble metals in stability, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. In this study, a composite 3D printing filament (T-TPU), composed of titanium nitride (TiN) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), was synthesized using a combined extrusion process involving a twin-screw extruder and a single-screw extruder. The resulting T-TPU filament could be used with fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing to produce custom-designed patterns. Notably, these printed patterns exhibited superior photothermal performance, with potential applications in photothermal de-icing and infrared labeling. Additionally, the wavelength-dependent plasmonic and photothermal responses of the printed patterns were experimentally investigated and supported by finite elemental method (FEM) simulations, revealing a temperature increase of approximately 2.5 under IR LED light when compared to commercial black thermoplastic polyurethane (C-TPU), that was more obvious than a difference less than 1 under UV or visible LED light sources. Finally, the mechanical properties of T-TPU, altered by the inclusion of TiN nanoparticles, were assessed, showing a slight enhancement in modulus and friction coefficient relative to neat TPU (N-TPU). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that the TiN nanoparticles promoted strong interactions between polymer chains and TiN particles, enhancing the modulus of elasticity and contributing to the improved mechanical properties of T-TPU. These findings suggest improved abrasion resistance, demonstrating the stability and durability of the composite material.</description>

      <title>CO$_2$ Conversion in Cu-Pd based Disordered Network Metamaterials with Ultra-Small Mode Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmons can drive chemical reactions by directly exciting intramolecular transitions. However, strong coupling of plasmons to single molecules remains a challenge as ultra-small mode volumes are required. In the presented work, we propose Cu-Pd plasmonic network metamaterials as a scalable platform for plasmon-assisted catalysis. Due to the absence of translational symmetry, these networks provide a unique plasmonic environment featuring a large local density of optical states and an unparalleled density of hotspots that effectively localizes light in mode volumes $V&lt;8\cdot10^{-24}$ m$^3$. Catalytic performance tests during CO$_2$ conversion reveal production rates of up to 4.3$\cdot$10$^2$ mmol g$^{-1}$h$^{-1}$ and altered reaction selectivity under light illumination. Importantly, we show that the selectivity of the catalytic process can be tuned by modifying the network's chemical composition, offering a versatile approach to optimize reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Highly stable aluminum air-bridges with stiffeners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air-bridges play a critical role in the performance of microwave circuits integrated with superconducting quantum bits, and their mechanical stability is predominant for reliable operation. This study is devoted to the technological issues that lead to air-bridge instability. We propose an optimized bridge geometry designed to enhance mechanical resilience. Through systematic testing, we established that bridges incorporating this novel geometry achieved complete stability for lengths up to 170 micrometers in our technological processes. The findings provide an insight into the problem and a practical solution for technologists that faced with the challenges of air-bridge stability. The implementation of our technology has the potential to significantly improve the mechanical robustness of air-bridges in multi-qubit circuits for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Deep noise squeezing in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we investigate white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. We use Green's functions to analyse the response of resonators to added noise. In one approach, we obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method, while in the second approach, exactly, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonators response to added noise. In a single parametric resonator, due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning at the instability threshold in a single parametrically-driven resonator. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a dynamical system consisting a parametric resonator linearly coupled to a harmonic resonator. In this system, we were able to observe deep squeezing at around $-40$~dB in one of the quadratures of the harmonic resonator response. We noticed that this occurs near a Hopf bifurcation to parametric instability, which is only possible when the dynamics of the coupled resonators cannot be decomposed into normal modes. Finally, we also showed that our analysis of squeezing based on Floquet theory can be applied to multiple coupled resonators with parametric modulation and multiple noise inputs.</description>

      <title>Defect density quantification in monolayer MoS2 using helium atom micro-diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2D materials continue to be pivotal in the advancement of modern devices. Their optoelectronic, mechanical and thermal properties can be finely modulated using a variety of methods, including strain, passivation, doping and defect density. Vacancy-type defect density, as found in the prototypical MoS2, in 2D materials is inherently difficult to measure due to their thickness. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction using a 5 {\mu}m beam size can be used to measure defect density in ~15x20 {\mu}m monolayer MoS2 quickly and easily at low cost compared to standard methods. We find that diffracted helium intensity is inversely proportional to defect density and that the method can be used as a standalone measure of vacancy-type defect density in monolayer MoS2, with the ability to spatially map defect density. We compare our results to photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and stoichiometric beam-line XPS. Furthermore, we provide computational and theoretical evidence that the method is agnostic to sample chemistry and can therefore immediately be applied to the measurement of vacancy-type defect density on the surface of any crystalline material. Our results demonstrate helium atom micro-diffraction as a rapid, low cost and lab-based alternative to often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming beam-line techniques such as XPS, improving accessibility to 2D materials science and device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Giant magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy in Fe--Co alloy under uniaxial compression: first-principles prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniaxially strained Fe--Co disordered alloys have emerged as promising candidates for cost-effective rare-earth-free permanent magnets due to their high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Using first-principles, fully relativistic calculations within the coherent potential approximation and PBE exchange-correlation potential, we explore the MAE of tetragonal Fe--Co alloys under uniaxial compression. Our results reveal a previously uncharted high-MAE region, distinct from known structures and accessible through uniaxial compression.</description>
