      <title>A double explosive Kuramoto transition in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a generalised concept that will enable double explosive transitions in the forward and backward directions or a combination thereof. We found two essential factors for generating such phase transitions: the use of higher-order (triadic) interactions and the partial adaptation of a global order parameter acting on the triadic coupling. A compromise between the two factors may result in a double explosive transition. To reinforce numerical observations, we employed the Ott--Antonsen ansatz. We observed that for a wide class of hypergraphs, combining two elements can result in a double explosive transition.</description>

      <title>Soliton foam formation in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of composite solitons produced by scalar fields without thermal phase transitions in the early Universe is considered. We present numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of soliton structures at the post-inflationary stage. The realistic initial conditions are obtained through the simulation of multiple quantum fluctuations during the inflation epoch. The initial field distributions allow to form local soliton clusters in the early Universe without the need for the thermal production of a soliton network throughout the Universe. We find that in three-dimensional space, the nontrivial composite field structures are formed in the form of &lt;&lt;soliton foam&gt;&gt;, consisting of closed domain walls, domain walls bounded by cosmic strings, and scalar field radiation. The possible cosmological implications of the soliton foam are discussed.</description>

      <title>Oscillons in AdS space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study oscillons in a real scalar field theory in a (3+1)-dimensional AdS space with global coordinates. The initial configuration is given by a Gaussian shape with an appropriate core size as in Minkowski spacetime. The solution exhibits a long lifetime. In particular, since the AdS space can be seen as a box, the recurrence phenomenon can be observed under suitable conditions. Finally, we discuss some potential applications of the oscillon in the context of AdS/CFT duality.</description>

      <title>Kink movement on a periodic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of the kink in the sine-Gordon (sG) model in the presence of periodic inhomogeneity is studied. An ansatz is proposed that allows for the construction of a reliable effective model with two degrees of freedom. Effective models with excellent agreement with the original field-theoretic partial differential equation are constructed, including in the non-perturbative region and for relativistic velocities. The numerical solutions of the sG model describing the evolution of the kink in the presence of a barrier as well as in the case of a periodic heterogeneity under the potential additional influence of a switched bias current and/or dissipation were obtained. The results of the field equation and the effective models were compared. The effect of the choice of initial conditions in the field model on the agreement of the results with the effective model is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Quantum and Stochastic Toolbox: xSPDE4.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the fourth major release of the xSPDE toolbox, which solves stochastic partial and ordinary differential equations, with applications in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physics and quantum technologies. It computes statistical averages, including time-step and sampling error estimation. xSPDE can provide higher order convergence, Fourier spectra and probability densities. The toolbox has graphical output and $\chi^{2}$ statistics, as well as weighted, projected, or forward-backward equations. It can generate input-output quantum spectra. The equations can have independent periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann or Robin boundary conditions in any dimension, for any vector component, and at either end of any interval. xSPDE has functions that can numerically solve both ordinary and partial differential stochastic equations of any type, obtaining correlations, probabilities and averages. The toolbox has a core treating stochastic differential equations, with averages, probability distributions and full error estimates. There are stochastic extensions treating applications to partial differential equations, projected equations, quantum stochastic equations, master equations and quantum phase-space simulations including Gaussian boson sampling experiments.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>
