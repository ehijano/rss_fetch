      <title>Initial Conditions from Galaxies: Machine-Learning Subgrid Correction to Standard Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid method for reconstructing the primordial density from late-time halos and galaxies. Our approach involves two steps: (1) apply standard Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) reconstruction to recover the large-scale features in the primordial density field and (2) train a deep learning model to learn small-scale corrections on partitioned subgrids of the full volume. At inference, this correction is then convolved across the full survey volume, enabling scaling to large survey volumes. We train our method on both mock halo catalogs and mock galaxy catalogs in both configuration and redshift space from the Quijote $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation suite. When evaluated on held-out simulations, our combined approach significantly improves the reconstruction cross-correlation coefficient with the true initial density field and remains robust to moderate model misspecification. Additionally, we show that models trained on $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ can be applied to larger boxes--e.g., $(3h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$--without retraining. Finally, we perform a Fisher analysis on our method's recovery of the BAO peak, and find that it significantly improves the error on the acoustic scale relative to standard BAO reconstruction. Ultimately, this method robustly captures nonlinearities and bias without sacrificing large-scale accuracy, and its flexibility to handle arbitrarily large volumes without escalating computational requirements makes it especially promising for large-volume surveys like DESI.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approaches for multi-scale structural analysis with atomic resolution electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-resolution imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the nanoscale structure of materials, in particular features such as defects, local strains, and symmetry-breaking distortions. In addition to advanced instrumentation, the effectiveness of the technique depends on computational image analysis to extract meaningful features from complex datasets recorded in experiments, which can be complicated by the presence of noise and artifacts, small or overlapping features, and the need to scale analysis over large representative areas. Here, we present image analysis approaches which synergize real and reciprocal space information to efficiently and reliably obtain meaningful structural information with picometer scale precision across hundreds of nanometers of material from atomic-resolution electron microscope images. Damping superstructure peaks in reciprocal space allows symmetry-breaking structural distortions to be disentangled from other sources of inhomogeneity and measured with high precision. Real space fitting of the wave-like signals resulting from Fourier filtering enables absolute quantification of lattice parameter variations and strain, as well as the uncertainty associated with these measurements. Implementations of these algorithms are made available as an open source Python package.</description>

      <title>STRAUSS: Sonification Tools &amp; Resources for Analysis Using Sound Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sonification, or conveying data using non-verbal audio, is a relatively niche but growing approach for presenting data across multiple specialist domains including astronomy, climate science, and beyond. The STRAUSS Python package aims to provide such a tool, which builds upon previous approaches to provide a powerful means to explore different ways of expressing data, with fine control over the output audio and its format. STRAUSS is a free, open source (FOSS) package, designed to allow flexible and effective sonification to be integrated into data workflows, in analogy to widely used visualisation packages. The remit of STRAUSS is broad; it is intended to be able to bridge between ad-hoc solutions for sonifying very particular datasets, and highly technical compositional and sound-design tools that are not optimised for sonification, or may have a steep learning curve. The code offers a range of approaches to sonification for a variety of contexts (e.g. science education, science communication, technical data analysis, etc). To this end, STRAUSS is packaged with a number of examples of different sonification approaches, and preset configurations to support "low-barrier, high-ceiling" approach. STRAUSS has been used to produce both educational resources and analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Augmenting chemical databases for atomistic machine learning by sampling conformational space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a standard tool for the exploration of chemical space. Much of the performance of such models depends on the chosen database for a given task. Here, this aspect is investigated for "chemical tasks" including the prediction of hybridization, oxidation, substituent effects, and aromaticity, starting from an initial "restricted" database (iRD). Choosing molecules for augmenting this iRD, including increasing numbers of conformations generated at different temperatures, and retraining the models can improve predictions of the models on the selected "tasks". Addition of a small percentage of conformers (1 % ) obtained at 300 K improves the performance in almost all cases. On the other hand, and in line with previous studies, redundancy and highly deformed structures in the augmentation set compromise prediction quality. Energy and bond distributions were evaluated by means of Kullback-Leibler ($D_{\rm KL}$) and Jensen-Shannon ($D_{\rm JS}$) divergence and Wasserstein distance ($W_{1}$). The findings of this work provide a baseline for the rational augmentation of chemical databases or the creation of synthetic databases.</description>

      <title>Composition Design of Shape Memory Ceramics based on Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Gaussian process machine learning model to predict the transformation temperature and lattice parameters of ZrO$_2$-based ceramics. Our overall goal is to search for a shape memory ceramic with a reversible transformation and low hysteresis. The identification of a new low hysteresis composition is based on design criteria that have been successful in metal alloys: (1) $\lambda_2 = 1$, where $\lambda_2$ is the middle eigenvalue of the transformation stretch tensor, (2) minimizing the max$|q(f)|$, which measures the deviation from satisfying the cofactor conditions, (3) high transformation temperature, (4) low transformational volume change, and (5) solid solubility. We generate many synthetic compositions, and identify a promising composition, 31.75Zr-37.75Hf-14.5Y-14.5Ta-1.5Er, which closely satisfies all the design criteria based on predictions from machine learning. However, differential thermal analysis reveals a relatively high thermal hysteresis of 137{\deg}C for this composition, indicating that the proposed design criteria are not universally applicable to all ZrO$_2$-based ceramics. We also explore reducing tetragonality of the austenite phase by addition of Er$_2$O$_3$. The idea is to tune the lattice parameters of austenite phase towards a cubic structure will increase the number of martensite variants, thus, allowing more flexibility for them to accommodate high strain during transformation. We find the effect of Er$_2$O$_3$ on tetragonality is weak due to limited solubility. We conclude that a more effective dopant is needed to achieve significant tetragonality reduction. Overall, Gaussian process machine learning models are shown to be highly useful for prediction of compositions and lattice parameters, but the discovery of low hysteresis ceramic materials apparently involves other factors not relevant to phase transformations in metals.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Random Concentrated Optimization Without Convexity Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to minimize a continuous function over a subset $\mathcal{S}$ of high-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^K$ without assuming convexity. The method alternates between Global Search (GS) to identify candidates and Concentrated Search (CS) regimes to improve an eligible candidate in $\mathcal{S}$. Beyond the alternation between regimes, the originality of the method lies in leveraging high dimensionality. We demonstrate concentration properties under the $CS$ regime. In parallel, we show that $GS$ reaches any point in finite time. Finally, two applications are proposed. The first is the reduction of the $L_1$ norm in the Lasso to demonstrate the relevance of the method. In a second application, we compress neural network by pruning weights while maintaining performance. Our approach achieves significant weight reduction with minimal performance loss, offering an effective solution for network optimization.</description>

      <title>Low-power multi-mode fiber projector overcomes shallow neural networks classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of disordered photonics, the characterization of optically opaque materials for light manipulation and imaging is a primary aim. Among various complex devices, multi-mode optical fibers stand out as cost-effective and easy-to-handle tools, making them attractive for several tasks. In this context, we cast these fibers into random hardware projectors, transforming an input dataset into a higher dimensional speckled image set. The goal of our study is to demonstrate that using such randomized data for classification by training a single logistic regression layer improves accuracy compared to training on direct raw images. Interestingly, we found that the classification accuracy achieved is higher than that obtained with the standard transmission matrix model, a widely accepted tool for describing light transmission through disordered devices. We conjecture that the reason for such improved performance could be due to the fact that the hardware classifier operates in a flatter region of the loss landscape when trained on fiber data, which aligns with the current theory of deep neural networks. These findings suggest that the class of random projections operated by multi-mode fibers generalize better to previously unseen data, positioning them as promising tools for optically-assisted neural networks. With this study, in fact, we want to contribute to advancing the knowledge and practical utilization of these versatile instruments, which may play a significant role in shaping the future of neuromorphic machine learning.</description>
