      <title>On positive Jacobi matrices with compact inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider positive Jacobi matrices $J$ with compact inverses and consequently with purely discrete spectra. A number of properties of the corresponding sequence of orthogonal polynomials is studied including the convergence of their zeros, the vague convergence of the zero counting measures and of the Christoffel--Darboux kernels on the diagonal. Particularly, if the inverse of $J$ belongs to some Schatten class, we identify the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of orthogonal polynomials and express it in terms of its regularized characteristic function. In the even more special case when the inverse of $J$ belongs to the trace class we derive various formulas for the orthogonality measure, eigenvectors of $J$ as well as for the functions of the second kind and related objects. These general results are given a more explicit form in the case when $-J$ is a generator of a Birth--Death process. Among others we provide a formula for the trace of the inverse of $J$. We illustrate our results by introducing and studying a modification of $q$-Laguerre polynomials corresponding to a determinate moment problem.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst-case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Functional Inequalities for doubly weighted Brownian Motion with Sticky-Reflecting Boundary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give upper bounds for the Poincar\'e and Logarithmic Sobolev constants for doubly weighted Brownian motion on manifolds with sticky reflecting boundary diffusion under curvature assumptions on the manifold and its boundary. We therefor use an interpolation approach based on energy interactions between the boundary and the interior of the manifold and the weighted Reilly formula. Along the way we also obtain a lower bound on the first nontrivial doubly weighted Steklov eigenvalue and an upper bound on the norm of the doubly weighted boundary trace operator on Sobolev functions. We also consider the case of weighted Brownian motion with pure sticky reflection.</description>

      <title>Dirac bag model on thin domains: a microlocal viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dirac operator is considered on a bidimensional domain whose boundary carries the infinite mass boundary condition. The analysis is focused on the existence of discrete spectrum and on its asymptotic description in the thin width limit. We revisit a recent result by using an alternative view point inspired by microlocal analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Maxwell Equations for a Flat Interface between Homogeneous Dispersive Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper determines and classifies the spectrum of a non-self-adjoint operator pencil generated by the time-harmonic Maxwell problem with a nonlinear dependence on the frequency for the case of two homogeneous materials joined at a planar interface. We study spatially one-dimensional and two-dimensional reductions in the whole space $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$. The dependence on the spectral parameter, i.e. the frequency, is in the dielectric function and we make no assumptions on its form. These function values determine the spectral sets. In order to allow also for non-conservative media, the dielectric function is allowed to be complex, yielding a non-self-adjoint problem. The whole spectrum consists of eigenvalues and the essential spectrum, but the various standard types of essential spectra do not coincide in all cases. The main tool for determining the essential spectra are Weyl sequences.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time Strichartz estimates and cubic Schr\"odinger equation in a conical singular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:1702.05813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on a metric cone $X$, where $X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)_r\times Y$ and the cross section $Y$ is a $(n-1)$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$. For the metric $g$ on $X$ given by $g=dr^2+r^2h$, let $\Delta_g$ be the positive Friedrichs extension Laplacian on $X$ and $V=V_0 r^{-2}$ where $V_0\in\CC^\infty(Y)$ is a real function such that the operator $P:=\Delta_h+V_0+(n-2)^2/4$ is a strictly positive operator on $L^2(Y)$. We establish the full range of global-in-time Strichartz estimates without loss for the Schr\"odinger equation associated with the operator $\LL_V=\Delta_g+V_0 r^{-2}$ including the endpoint estimate both in homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. A new finding reveals that the range of admissible pairs at $\dot H^s$-level is influenced by the smallest eigenvalue of the operator $P$. This additionally proves the conjecture in Wang [Ann. Inst. Fourier 2006] and generalizes the results of Ford [Comm. Math. Phys. 2010] and Baskin-Marzuola-Wunsch [Contemp. Math. 2014]. As an application, we show the well-posedness theory and scattering theory for the Schr\"odinger equation with a cubic nonlinearity on this setting which verifies a conjecture in Baskin-Marzuola-Wunsch [Contemp. Math. 2014].</description>

      <title>On absolutely continuous spectrum for one-channel unitary operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the radial transfer matrix formalism for unitary one-channel operators. This generalizes previous formalisms for CMV matrices and scattering zippers. We establish an analog of Carmona's formula and deduce criteria for absolutely continuous spectrum which we apply to random Hilbert Schmidt perturbations of periodic scattering zippers.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous spaces of entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous spaces are de Branges' Hilbert spaces of entire functions with the property that certain weighted rescaling transforms induce isometries of the space into itself. A classical example of a homogeneous space is the Paley-Wiener space of entire functions with exponential type at most a being square integrable on the real axis. Other examples occur in the theory of the Bessel equation. Being homogeneous is a strong property, and one can describe all homogeneous spaces, their structure Hamiltonians, and the measures associated with chains of such spaces, explicitly in terms of powers, logarithms, and confluent hypergeometric functions.
  The theory of homogeneous spaces was in large parts settled by L.de Branges in the early 1960's. However, in his work some connections and explicit formulae are not given, some results are stated without a proof, and last but not least a mistake occurs which seemingly remained unnoticed up to the day.
  In this paper we give a detailed account on homogeneous spaces. We provide explicit proofs for all formulae and relations between the mentioned objects, and correct the mentioned mistake.</description>
