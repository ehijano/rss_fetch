      <title>Tracing back a second-generation star stripped from Terzan 5 by the Galactic bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic bulge hosts the Milky Way's oldest stars, possibly coming from disrupted globular clusters (GCs) or the bulge's primordial building blocks, making these stars witnesses to the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. The Galactic bar currently dominates the bulge's region, altering the orbits of objects formed before its formation and complicating the trace of the field stars' original clusters. Here, we present the discovery of a fossil record of this evolution, SOS1 -- a star trapped in the bar, exhibiting significant enhancements in nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, typical of second-generation GC stars. SOS1 also shows an s-process Ce enhancement, suggesting an old age and early enrichment by fast-rotating massive stars in the Galaxy's earliest phases. With the purpose of finding the SOS1's parent GC, we derive its precise chemodynamical properties by combining high-precision proper motions from Gaia with APOGEE detailed chemical abundances. Our analysis suggests that SOS1 was possibly stripped from the GC Terzan 5 by the Galactic bar's gravitational influence approximately 350 Myr ago. We also found chemical similarities suggesting that SOS1 belonged to the most metal-poor, ancient, and peripheral stellar population of Terzan 5. These results not only support the hypothesis that Terzan 5 is a remnant of a primordial building block of the Galactic bulge, but also suggest this cluster continues losing stars to the bar. Our method highlights how powerful the use of chemodynamical properties in the Gaia era is for tracing the Galaxy's evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dark Side of UV/Optical Bright Galaxies: Optically Thick Dust Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, a population of galaxies invisible in optical/near-infrared, but bright at longer wavelengths, have been identified through color selections. These so-called optically faint/dark galaxies are considered to be massive quiescent galaxies or highly dust-attenuated galaxies. Having the entire galaxy obscured by dust, however, is likely an extreme case of the much more common occurrence of optically thin and thick absorption coexisting in the same system. With the power of JWST imaging, we are able to spatially resolve massive galaxies at z~3, accurately model their spectral energy distributions, and identify candidate optically thick substructures. We target galaxies with log(M*/Msun)&gt;10.3 and 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.5, and get 486 galaxies in CEERS and PRIMER fields. Based on excess NIR luminosity, we identify 162 galaxies (~33\% of the parent sample) as candidate hosts of optically thick substructures. We then carry out spatially resolved SED modeling to explore the physical properties of those dark substructures and estimate the amount of optically thick obscuration. We find that optically thick dust is ubiquitous in normal massive galaxies with a wide variety of SFR and morphology. 10-20\% of the stellar mass/SFR are unaccounted for in our selected galaxies, and the fraction is insensitive to stellar mass or SFR. The dark substructures are generally dustier than the rest of the galaxies and are irregularly distributed, arguing against an obscured AGN as the source of the NIR excess. A correlation between the obscured luminosity and the presence of a recent starburst in the past &lt;100 Myr is also observed.</description>

      <title>Radio-AGN activity across the galaxy population: dependence on stellar mass, star-formation rate, and redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the co-evolution of radio-loud AGN and their galaxies by mapping the dependence of radio-loud AGN activity on stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time (out to $z \sim 1.5$). Deep LOFAR radio observations are combined with large galaxy samples to study the incidence of radio-loud AGN across the galaxy population; the AGN are further split into low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We find that LERG activity occurs over a wide range of SFRs, whereas HERGs are typically found in galaxies with ongoing star formation. The LERGs are then split based on their SFRs relative to the main sequence, across redshift. Within quiescent galaxies, LERG activity shows a steep stellar mass dependence with the same normalisation across the past $\sim$ 10 Gyr; this indicates that hot gas fuels LERGs in quiescent galaxies across cosmic time. In massive galaxies ($\log_{10}(M/\rm{M_{\odot}}) \gtrsim 11$), the incidence of LERGs is roughly constant across the galaxy population, suggesting that LERGs in massive galaxies may be fuelled by hot gas regardless of the star-formation activity. At lower masses, however, LERG activity is significantly more enhanced (by a factor of up to 10) in star-forming galaxies compared to quiescent galaxies; this suggests that an additional fuelling mechanism, likely associated with cold gas, may fuel the LERGs in galaxies with higher SFRs. We find that HERGs typically accrete above 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate, and the LERGs typically accrete below this level.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Galaxy-Dust Modeling with Coupled Data-Driven Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A notorious problem in astronomy is the recovery of the true shape and spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy despite attenuation by interstellar dust embedded in the same galaxy. This problem has been solved for a few hundred nearby galaxies with exquisite data coverage, but these techniques are not scalable to the billions of galaxies soon to be observed by large wide-field surveys like LSST, Euclid, and Roman. We present a method for jointly modeling the spatially resolved stellar and dust properties of galaxies from multi-band images. To capture the diverse geometries of galaxies, we consider non-parametric morphologies, stabilized by two neural networks that act as data-driven priors: the first informs our inference of the galaxy's underlying morphology, the second constrains the galaxy's dust morphology conditioned on our current estimate of the galaxy morphology. We demonstrate with realistic simulations that we can recover galaxy host and dust properties over a wide range of attenuation levels and geometries. We successfully apply our joint galaxy-dust model to three local galaxies observed by SDSS. In addition to improving estimates of unattenuated galaxy SEDs, our inferred dust maps will facilitate the study of dust production, transport, and destruction.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Formation History of Intrahalo Light with Horizon Run 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation history of intrahalo light (IHL) using the high-resolution (~1 kpc), large-scale (~Gpc) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Horizon Run 5 (HR5). IHL particles are identified by carefully considering both their binding energies and positions with respect to the tidal radii of individual galaxies. By analyzing more than 1,200 galaxy groups and clusters with $\geq 10^{13} M_{\odot}$ and tracing their individual IHL particles back in time, we classify the origin of each IHL particle at each epoch based on the status of the originating galaxy into three categories: brightest halo galaxy (BHG) formation/merger, satellite galaxy stripping, and pre-processing. Our study reveals that the IHL production through BHG formation/merger is the predominant production channel, contributing over 60\% of the total IHL mass across all redshifts. The second most significant IHL production channel is pre-processing, providing more than 20\% in the final HR5 snapshot. Stripping is negligible at $z&gt;4$ but becomes gradually more important as halos mature at $z&lt;4$. Finally, we verify that IHL production through the disruption of dwarf galaxies and in-situ formation is negligible, contributing less than ~3\% and ~0.5\% to the total IHL production, respectively.</description>

      <title>The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Modelling ALMA and JWST lines to constrain the interstellar medium of $z\sim 5$ galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we devise a model for estimating UV and optical line emission (i.e., CIII] $1909$A, H$\beta$, [OIII] $5007$A, H$\alpha$, [NII] $6583$A) tracing HII regions in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies at $z\sim4-6$ from the ALMA Large Programme ALPINE. The aim is to investigate the impact of binary stars in the stellar population along with an abrupt quenching in the Star Formation History (SFH) on line emission. This is crucial for understanding the ISM's properties in early galaxies and identifying new star formation tracers in high-$z$ galaxies. The model simulates HII+Photodissociation Region (PDR) complexes through radiative transfer in 1D slabs, characterized by gas density ($n$), ionisation parameter ($U$), and metallicity ($Z$). It considers: (a) heating from star formation (SF), simulated with Starburst99 and BPASS to quantify binary stars impact; (b) constant, exponentially declining, and quenched SFH scenarios. For each galaxy, we select theoretical ratios from CLOUDY models between [CII] line emission, tracing PDRs, and nebular lines from HII regions, using these to derive expected optical/UV lines from observed [CII]. We find binary stars strongly impact line emission post-quenching, keeping UV photon flux higher for longer, maintaining free electron temperature and ionised column density in HII regions up to 5 Myr after quenching. We constrain ISM properties of our subsample, finding a low ionisation parameter $\log U{\approx}-3.8\pm 0.2$ and moderate/high densities $\log(n/\rm cm^{-3}){\approx}2.9\pm 0.6$. Finally, we derive UV/optical line luminosities-SFR relations for different burstiness parameters ($k_s$). In the fiducial BPASS model, relations show negligible SFH dependence but depend on $k_s$, while in the SB99 case, dependence is on SFH. We propose their use for characterising the burstiness of high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>The VANDELS Survey: Star formation and quenching in two over-densities at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Understanding galaxy evolution in dense environments, particularly proto-clusters, is crucial for studying mechanisms driving star formation and quenching. Aims: This study examines how two proto-cluster over-densities at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4 impact star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and morphology, focusing on quenched galaxies. Methods: We identified proto-cluster over-densities in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) regions of the VANDELS survey. Using spectral energy distribution analysis, Bayesian methods (BEAGLE and BAGPIPES) helped derive best-fit parameters and U-V and V-J rest-frame colours (UVJ), classifying galaxies as quenched or star-forming based on UVJ diagrams and specific star formation rates (sSFR). TNG300 simulations aided interpretation. Results: Two of 13 proto-cluster over-densities host quenched galaxies with red U-V colours, low sSFR, and properties like massive passive galaxies. These quenched members are redder, older, more massive, and more compact. The highest-density peaks at z=3.55 and z=3.43 have dark matter halo masses consistent with proto-clusters and host AGNs, with five and three AGNs, respectively. Compared to field galaxies, these quenched members are in denser environments. TNG300 simulations suggest proto-clusters with quenched galaxies at high redshift evolve to contain more passive galaxies by z=1. Conclusions: The over-densities host massive quenched galaxies and AGNs in their densest peaks. Simulations reveal that sSFR for passive galaxies in proto-clusters was high at z=6, with median mass growth rates of 96% from z=6 to z=3. Conditions for mass assembly likely involve galaxy interactions and high gas accretion in dense environments. Black hole growth and AGN feedback appear to drive quenching at z=3, aligning with the properties of quenched galaxies observed in our study.</description>

      <title>Revisiting rotationally excited CH at radio wavelengths: A case study towards W51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since they were first detected in the interstellar medium, the radio wavelength (3.3 GHz) hyperfine-structure splitting transitions in the rotational ground state of CH have been observed to show anomalous excitation. Astonishingly, this behaviour has been uniformly observed towards a variety of different sources probing a wide range of physical conditions. While the observed level inversion can be explained globally by a pumping scheme involving collisions, a description of the extent of 'over-excitation' observed in individual sources requires the inclusion of radiative processes, involving transitions at higher rotational levels. Therefore, a complete description of the excitation mechanism in the CH ground state, observed towards individual sources entails observational constraints from the rotationally excited levels of CH and in particular that of its first rotationally excited state. Given the limited detections of these lines, the objective of this work is to characterise the physical and excitation properties of the rotationally excited lines of CH near 700 MHz, and investigate their influence on the pumping mechanisms of the ground-state lines of CH. This work presents the first interferometric search for the rotationally excited lines of CH near 700 MHz carried out using the uGMRT array and jointly models the physical and excitation conditions traced by lines from both the ground and first rotationally excited states of CH.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Galaxy Morphology-Star Formation Activity-Clustercentric Radius Relations in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate when and how the relations of galaxy morphology and star forming activity with clustercentric radius become evident in galaxy clusters. We identify 162 galaxy clusters with total mass $M_{\rm tot}^{\rm cl} &gt; 5 \times 10^{13} {\rm M}_\odot$ at $z = 0.625$ in the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and study how the properties of the galaxies with stellar mass $M_\ast &gt; 5 \times 10^9 {\rm M}_\odot$ near the cluster main progenitors have evolved in the past. Galaxies are classified into disk, spheroid, and irregular morphological types according to the asymmetry and Sersic index of their stellar mass distribution. We also classify galaxies into active and passive ones depending on their specific star-formation rate. We find that the morphology-clustercentric radius relation (MRR) emerges at $z \simeq 1.8$ as the fraction of spheroidal types exceeds 50% in the central region ($d \lesssim 0.1 R_{200}$). Galaxies outside the central region remain disk-dominated. Numerous encounters between galaxies in the central region seem to be responsible for the morphology transformation from disks to spheroids. We also find that the star formation activity-clustercentric radius relation emerges at an epoch different from that of MRR. At $z\simeq0.8$, passive galaxies start to dominate the intermediate radius region ($0.1\lesssim d/R_{200} \lesssim0.3$) and this "quenching region" grows inward and outward thereafter. The region dominated by early-type galaxies (spheroids and passive disks) first appears at the central region at $z\simeq 1.8$, expands rapidly to larger radii as the population of passive disks grows in the intermediate radii, and clusters are dominated by early types after $z\simeq 0.8$.</description>

      <title>The circumgalactic medium traced by Mg II absorption with DESI: dependence on galaxy stellar mass, star formation rate and azimuthal angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) distribution of galaxies is the key to revealing the dynamical exchange of materials between galaxies and their surroundings. In this work, we use DESI EDR dataset to investigate the cool CGM of galaxies ($0.3&lt;z&lt;1.7$) with stacking the spectra of background QSOs to obtain Mg II absorption of foreground galaxies. The equivalent width of Mg II absorption strongly correlates to stellar mass with EW(Mg II) $\propto M_{*}^{0.5}$ for star-forming galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10$, but is independent with mass for galaxies above this mass. At given stellar mass, EW(Mg II) is larger for galaxies of higher star formation rate with impact parameter less than $50$ kpc, while showing little dependence on galaxy size. By studying the dependence on azimuthal angle, we find EW(Mg II) is strongest at the direction near the minor axis for star-forming galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10.0$, while no dependence on azimuthal angle is seen for luminous red galaxies. This indicates that the outflow associated with star formation enhances the Mg II absorption. However, for galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot} &gt; 10.0$, the EW(Mg II) at the minor axis is largely suppressed with respect to low mass galaxies. This suggests that the competing processes, such as stellar feedback and gravity, play a key role in shaping the distribution of outflowing gas.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Dissecting the multiple sub-structures and probing their complex interactions in the \Lyalpha emitter galaxy CR7 at z = 6.6 with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of the \Lyalpha emitter CR7 at z ~ 6.6, observed as part of the GA-NIFS program. Using low-resolution PRISM (R ~ 100) data, we confirm a bright \Lyalpha emitter, and a diffuse \Lyalpha halo extending up to 3 kpc from the peak of ionized emission, both of them associated to the most massive, UV bright galaxy in the system (CR7-A). We confirm the presence of two additional UV-bright satellites (CR7-B and CR7-C) detected at projected distances of 6.4 and 5.2 kpc from the primary source. We perform SED fitting of the low-resolution data and revealed an inverted star formation history between two satellites at early epochs and a spatially resolved anti-correlation of the gas-phase metallicity and the star formation rate density, likely driven by the gas exchange among the satellites, favouring the merger scenario for CR7. From the high-resolution G395H (R ~ 2700) data, we discover at least three additional companions mainly traced by the \OIIIL emission line, although they are not detected in continuum. We disentangle the kinematics of the system and reveal extended ionised emission linking the main galaxy and the satellites. We spatially resolve the \OIIIL, \OIII[4363], and \Hgamma emission lines and use a diagnostic diagram tailored to high-z systems to reveal tentative evidence of AGN ionisation across the main galaxy (CR7-A) and the N-E companion (CR7-B). Moreover, we detect an unresolved blue-shifted outflow from one of the satellites and present first evidence for a redshifted outflow from the main galaxy. Finally, we compute resolved electron temperature (T$_e \sim 1.6 \times 10^4$ K) and metallicity maps (log(Z/\zsun) from --0.8 to --0.5), and provide insights on how the physical properties of the system evolved at earlier epochs.</description>

      <title>Investigating Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei with Long-term Optical and X-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) show the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines in their UV/optical spectra on timescales of months to decades. Here, we investigate how CL transitions depend on several AGN parameters such as accretion rate, obscuration properties and black hole mass. We study a sample of 20 nearby optically-identified CLAGNs from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), using quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observations taken in the last $\sim 40$ years. We find that for all CLAGNs, the transition is accompanied by a change in Eddington ratio. The CL transitions are not associated with changes in the obscuration properties of the AGN. CLAGNs are found to have a median Eddington ratio lower than the AGNs in the BASS sample in which CL transitions were not detected. The median of the transition Eddington ratio (Eddington ratio at which AGN changes its state) is found to be $\sim 0.01$ for type 1 $\leftrightarrow$ 1.8/1.9/2 transition, which is consistent with the hard $\leftrightarrow$ soft state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. Most CL events are constrained to occur within 3-4 years, which is considerably shorter than the expected viscous timescale in AGN accretion disk. The transitions of the optical CLAGNs studied here are likely associated to state changes in the accretion flow, possibly driven by disk-instability.</description>

      <title>Starburst heating and synthetic ion column densities in multiphase galactic outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-driven galactic winds are multiphase outflows of energy and matter connecting the interstellar and circumgalactic media (CGM) with the intergalactic medium. Galactic winds contain a hot and diffuse phase detected in X-rays, and a cold and dense phase detected via emission and absorption lines from the ions populating the outflow. The ion production within galactic winds largely depends on the background UV radiation field produced by star formation, and this in turn depends on the age of the starburst, the gas metallicity, the proximity of the outflowing gas to the central star-forming regions. Our study probes the influence of the proximity of wind-cloud systems to the UV background source, and the effects of magnetic fields on the N V ion production through the analysis of synthetic column densities and spectral lines. We utilise magnetohydrodynamical simulations to study weakly-magnetised wind-cloud systems, and extract synthetic spectral lines with Trident and yt. Our simulations indicate that magnetic fields transverse to the wind have a shielding effect on dense gas, producing broader N V absorption lines. Also, a weak (distant) UV background produces N V only in the outer cloud layers with no spectral signature, while a strong (nearby) UV background produces it in the cloud core with a narrow spectral line. Overall, transverse magnetic fields and a UV radiation at 50 kpc produce the stronger N V spectral lines.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Triatom-Atom Quantum Close-Coupling Dynamics in Full Dimensionality: all rovibrational mode quenching of water due to H impact on a six-dimensional potential energy surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rovibrational level populations, and subsequent emission in various astrophysical environments, is driven by inelastic collision processes. The available rovibrational rate coefficients for water have been calculated using a number of approximations. We present a numerically exact calculation for the rovibrational quenching for all water vibrational modes due to collisions with atomic hydrogen. The scattering theory implements a quantum close-coupling (CC) method on a high level ab initio six-dimensional (6D) potential energy surface (PES). Total rovibrational quenching cross sections for excited bending levels were compared with earlier results on a 4D PES with the rigid-bender close-coupling (RBCC) approximation. General agreement between 6D-CC and 4D-RBCC calculations are found, but differences are evident including the energy and amplitude of low-energy orbiting resonances. Quenching cross sections from the symmetric and asymmetric stretch modes are provided for the first time. The current 6D-CC calculation provides accurate inelastic data needed for astrophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Diverse pathways for supermassive black hole-galaxy coevolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are observed in diverse galaxy populations across time yet a clear understanding of how they coevolve with their hosts has not been reached. Physically-motivated models of SMBH accretion and feedback vary widely between galaxy formation simulations due to the difficulty of modeling the range of scales important for galactic and SMBH processes. Here we use observational data to build an empirical model for SMBH growth. We apply observed specific accretion rate probability distributions as a function of galaxy star formation rate between $z = 0-2$ to the UniverseMachine galaxy formation model to determine SMBH accretion rates based on galaxy properties. We use observed $z = 0$ SMBH-stellar mass relations for the quiescent and star-forming populations to provide the local boundary conditions for SMBH growth histories. We then track the coevolutionary histories of galaxy stellar mass and their SMBHs backwards in time to $z = 2$. We find that the most massive SMBHs at $z = 0$ have grown very little of their total mass between $z = 0-2$, indicating early SMBH mass assembly for these systems. Conversely, lower mass SMBHs at $z = 0$ assembled their mass gradually across $z = 0-2$. This results in substantial evolution of the SMBH-stellar mass relation, shifting to higher normalization and shallower slope with increasing redshift. We find that the substantial scatter observed in the $z = 0$ SMBH-stellar mass relation results in the diversity of growth pathways found in our model, with some galaxies assembling their stellar mass before their SMBHs and others doing the opposite.</description>

      <title>Intranight optical monitoring of the rare quasar J0950+5128, the brightest known candidate for transition from radio-quiet to radio-loud state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a novel pilot project to characterise intra-night optical variability (INOV) of an extremely rare type of quasar, which has recently been caught in the act of transiting from a radio-quiet to radio-loud state, on a decadal time scale. Such rare transitions may signify a recurrence, or conceivably the first switch-on of jet activity in optically luminous quasars. The newly formed jet could well be jittery and unsteady, both in power and direction. The optically brightest among such radio-state transition candidates, the quasar J0950+5128 ($z = 0.2142$), was monitored by us with dense sampling in the R-band, during 2020-21 in 6 sessions, each lasting $&gt;$ 4 hours. This is the first attempt to characterise the INOV properties associated with this recently discovered, extremely rarely observed phenomenon of quasar radio-state transition. The non-detection of INOV in any of the 6 sessions, down to the 1-2% level, amounts to a lack of evidence for a blazar-like optical activity, $\sim$ 2 years after its transition to radio-loud state was found. The only INOV feature detected in J0950+5128 during our observational campaign was a $\sim$ 0.15-mag spike lasting &lt; 6 minutes, seen at 13.97 UT on 18-March-2021. We also report the available optical light curves of this quasar from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, which indicate that it had experienced a phase of INOV activity around the time its transition to the radio-loud state was detected, however that phase did not sustain until the launch of our INOV campaign $\sim$ 2 years later.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the Universe, has traditionally been used to investigate astrophysical processes within and around our own Galaxy. In its chemically neutral, atomic form (known as HI in the astronomical literature), it has tremendous potential today as a tool for precision cosmology and testing theories of fundamental physics. Cosmological HI is accessed through two of its main spectral lines: the Lyman-$\alpha$, with a rest wavelength of 1216 $\r{A}$, in the ultraviolet and visible part of the spectrum, and the 21-cm, which manifests in the radio frequency band. A plethora of radio telescopes worldwide are focused on detecting the faint 21 cm signal from the dark ages and Cosmic Dawn, some of the earliest epochs of the Universe. This chapter will describe the formalism for doing cosmology with HI, the recent results from the facilities and their prospects for studying the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Jet Archaeology and Forecasting: Image Variability and Magnetic Field Configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how magnetic field variations around accreting black holes on event horizon scales affect the morphology of magnetically-driven jet on larger scales. By performing radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we find that temporal variation in the magnetic flux on the event horizon and the jet power are imprinted on the variability of jet width up to several hundred gravitational radii. When the magnetic flux around the black hole drops and then rises, the jet initially narrows or becomes truncated, then widens, creating a thin-thick pattern that propagates down the jet. This suggests that extended jet observations can provide a history record of horizon-scale magnetic field dynamics, and conversely, upcoming changes in the jet image can be predicted from direct observation of the magnetized accreting plasma near the black hole. Furthermore, the pattern of jet width variations shows acceleration up to the relativistic regime as it moves away from the black hole, aligning with plasma bulk motion. We also find in time-averaged images that both the bulk plasma motion and magnetic field configuration in the jet-launching region, which are sensitive to black hole spin, shape diverse features through relativistic beaming and aberration. Higher black hole spins result in more poloidal bulk motion and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to more symmetric jet images and linear polarization patterns. These results suggest a new method for testing the magnetically arrested disk model and the Blandford-Znajek process, and for determining the black hole spin through observations bridging horizon and jet-launching scales.</description>

      <title>Molecular Distributions and Abundances in the Binary-Shaped Outflow of V Hya</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaries are known to play a key role in the mass loss and dynamical environments of evolved stars. Stellar and sub-stellar companion interactions produce complex wind morphologies including rotating/expanding disks, bipolar outflows, and spiral wind patterns; however, the connection between these many structures and the gas phase chemistry they harbor is not well-constrained. To expand the sample of chemical inventories in interacting systems, we present a detailed spectroscopic case study of the binary C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star V Hya. Using spatially resolved ALMA observations at Bands 3, 6 and 7, we characterize the rotational emission lines and distributions of molecules in its surrounding disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE). We detect emission from over 15 molecules and isotopologues toward this source, and present resolved maps for the brightest tracers of carbonaceous chemistry (e.g. CCH, C4H, HC5N, HNC, CH3CN). Employing LTE and non-LTE models of emission from the DUDE, we estimate the abundance distributions for optically thin species, and compare them with prototypical carbon-rich AGB envelopes. We find that the average abundances of detected species are within a factor of ${\sim}5$ from sources with similar mass-loss rates; however, the distribution of daughter species in V Hya is much more compact, with carbon chain species (CCH, C4H, HC3N) appearing with abundances $&gt;$10$^{-7}$ even in the innermost sampled regions (200 au) of the disk.</description>

      <title>The EDGES measurement disfavors an excess radio background during the cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2018 the EDGES experiment claimed the first detection of the global cosmic 21cm signal, which featured an absorption trough centered around $z \sim 17$ with a depth of approximately -500mK. This amplitude is deeper than the standard prediction (in which the radio background is determined by the cosmic microwave background) by a factor of two and potentially hints at the existence of a radio background excess. While this result was obtained by fitting the data with a phenomenological flattened-Gaussian shape for the cosmological signal, here we develop a physical model for the inhomogeneous radio background sourced by the first galaxies hosting population III stars. Star formation in these galaxies is quenched at lower redshifts due to various feedback mechanisms, so they serve as a natural candidate for the excess radio background hinted by EDGES, without violating present day measurements by ARCADE2. We forward-model the EDGES sky temperature data, jointly sampling our physical model for the cosmic signal, a foreground model, and residual calibration errors. We compare the Bayesian evidences obtained by varying the complexity and prior ranges for the systematics. We find that the data is best explained by a model with seven log-polynomial foreground terms, and that it requires calibration residuals. Interestingly, the presence of a cosmic 21cm signal with a non-standard depth is decisively disfavored. This is contrary to previous EDGES analysis in the context of extra radio background models, serving as a caution against using a ''pseudo-likelihood'' built on a model (flattened Gaussian) that is different from the one being used for inference. We make our simulation code and associated emulator publicly-available.</description>

      <title>A Search for Asymmetric Kinematic Components in Circumstellar Envelopes Using OH Main Line Masers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars bf, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>Estimating Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and [{\alpha}/Fe] for LAMOST O-M type Stars Using a Spectral Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we developed a spectral emulator based on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory Stellar Library (MaStar) and a grouping optimization strategy to estimate effective temperature (T_eff), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the abundance of alpha elements with respect to iron ([alpha/Fe]) for O-M-type stars within the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution spectra. The primary aim is to use a rapid spectral-fitting method, specifically the spectral emulator with the grouping optimization strategy, to create a comprehensive catalog for stars of all types within LAMOST, addressing the shortcomings in parameter estimations for both cold and hot stars present in the official LAMOST AFGKM-type catalog. This effort is part of our series of studies dedicated to establishing an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effectively applicable to parameter prediction for LAMOST, with the single-machine processing time within $70$ hr. We observed that the internal error dispersions for T_eff, log g, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] across different spectral types lie within the ranges of $15-594$ K, $0.03-0.27$ dex, $0.02-0.10$ dex, and $0.01-0.04$ dex, respectively, indicating a good consistency. A comparative analysis with external data highlighted deficiencies in the official LAMOST catalog and issues with MaStar parameters, as well as potential limitations of our method in processing spectra with strong emission lines and bad pixels. The derived atmospheric parameters as a part of this work are available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101402/ .</description>

      <title>The overconcentrated dark halo in the strong lens SDSS J0946+1006 is a subhalo: evidence for self interacting dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is poorly constrained on subgalactic scales. Alternative models to cold dark matter, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, could produce very different dark haloes on these scales. One of the few known dark haloes smaller than a galaxy was discovered in the triple source plane strong lens system J0946+1006. Previous studies have found that this structure is much more concentrated than expected in $\Lambda$CDM, but have assumed the dark halo is at the same redshift as the main deflector ($z_{\rm main}=0.222$). In this paper, we fit for the redshift of this dark halo. We reconstruct the first two sources in the system using a forward modelling approach, allowing for additional complexity from multipole perturbations. We find that the perturber redshift is $z_{\rm halo} = {0.207}^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$, and lower bounds on the evidence strongly prefer a subhalo over a line-of-sight structure. Whilst modelling both background sources does not improve constraints on the redshift of the subhalo, it breaks important degeneracies affecting the reconstruction of multipole perturbations. We find that the subhalo is a more than $5\sigma$ outlier from the $\Lambda$CDM $v_{\rm max}$-$r_{\rm max}$ relation and has a steep profile with an average slope of $\gamma_{\rm 2D} = {-1.81}^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ for radii between $0.75-1.25$ kpc. This steep slope might indicate dark matter self-interactions causing the subhalo to undergo gravothermal collapse; such collapsed haloes are expected to have $\gamma_{\rm 2D} \approx -2$.</description>

      <title>Black hole jets on the scale of the Cosmic Web</title>

Abstract: Jets launched by supermassive black holes transport relativistic leptons, magnetic fields, and atomic nuclei from the centres of galaxies to their outskirts and beyond. These outflows embody the most energetic pathway by which galaxies respond to their Cosmic Web environment. Studying black hole feedback is an astrophysical frontier, providing insights on star formation, galaxy cluster stability, and the origin of cosmic rays, magnetism, and heavy elements throughout the Universe. This feedback's cosmological importance is ultimately bounded by the reach of black hole jets, and could be sweeping if jets travel far at early epochs. Here we present the joint LOFAR-uGMRT-Keck discovery of a black hole jet pair extending over $7$ megaparsecs -- the largest galaxy-made structure ever found. The outflow, seen $7.5$ gigayears into the past, spans two-thirds of a typical cosmic void radius, thus penetrating voids at ${\sim}95\%$ probability. This system demonstrates that jets can avoid destruction by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities over cosmological distances, even at epochs when the Universe was 15 to 7 times denser than it is today. Whereas previous record-breaking outflows were powered by radiatively inefficient active galactic nuclei, this outflow is powered by a radiatively efficient active galactic nucleus, a type common at early epochs. If, as implied, a population of early void-penetrating outflows existed, then black hole jets could have overwritten the fields from primordial magnetogenesis. This outflow shows that energy transport from supermassive black holes operates on scales of the Cosmic Web and raises the possibility that cosmic rays and magnetism in the intergalactic medium have a non-local, cross-void origin.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z &gt; 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in the distribution of HSC galaxy spin directions: comment on arXiv:2410.18884v1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, an asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of galaxy spin directions has been observed in data from all relevant digital sky surveys, all showing a higher number of galaxies rotating in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth. Additionally, JWST deep fields have shown that the asymmetry is clear and obvious, and can be sensed even by the naked human eye. These experiments were performed using two separate statistical methods: standard binomial distribution and simple $\chi^2$ statistics. Stiskalek \&amp; Desmond (2024) suggested that the asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions is due to the use of binomial or $\chi^2$ statistics. Instead, they developed a new complex ad-hoc statistical method that shows random distribution in galaxy spin directions, and specifically in data from HSC. Source code for the method was also made available. The primary downside of the new method is that it is not able to identify asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions. Even when the new method is provided with synthetic data with extreme and obvious asymmetry, it still reports a null-hypothesis Universe with random distribution. That shows empirically that the method cannot sense asymmetry in the distribution of the directions of rotation of galaxies. While this further concludes that the distribution of galaxy spin direction as observed from Earth is not symmetric, it is not necessarily an indication of an anomaly in the large-scale structure. The excessive number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way can also be driven by the internal structure of galaxies and the physics of galaxy rotation. The phenomenon can be related to other puzzling anomalies such the Ho tension. Data are publicly available, and no code is needed to reproduce the results since only conventional statistics is used.</description>

      <title>Regression for Astronomical Data with Realistic Distributions, Errors and Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that both the ML based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. We recommend the KS-test based method as the preferred choice for general applications, while the ML based method is suggested for small samples with sizes of $N &lt; 100$. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed ``raddest'', will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <title>JWST observations constrain the time evolution of fine structure constants and dark energy - electromagnetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was hypothesized in the literature that some physical parameters may be time-evolving and the astrophysical data can serve as a probe. Recently, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have released its early observations. In this work, we select the JWST spectroscopic observations of the high redshift ($z&gt;7.1$) galaxies with strong [OIII] ($\lambda=4959$ \AA \,and $5007$ \AA \,in the rest frame) emission lines to constraint the evolution of the fine structure constant ($\alpha$). With the spectra from two galaxies at redshifts of $7.19$ and $8.47$, the deviation of $\alpha$ to its fiducial value is found to be as small as $0.44^{+8.4+1.7}_{-8.3-1.7} \times 10^{-4}$ and $-10.0^{+18+1.5}_{-18-1.5} \times 10^{-4}$, respectively (the first error is statistical and the latter is systematic). The combination of our results with the previous data reveals that $\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{d \alpha}{dt} = 0.30^{+4.5}_{-4.5} \times 10^{-17}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$. Clearly, there is no evidence for a cosmic evolution of $\alpha$. The prospect of further constraining the time evolution of $\alpha$ is also discussed. The scalar field of dark energy is hypothesized to drive the acceleration of the universe's expansion through an interaction with the electromagnetic field. By integrating the observational data of the fine-structure constant variation, $\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}(z)$, we have established a stringent upper limit on the coupling strength between dark energy and electromagnetism. Our analysis yields $\zeta \leq 3.92 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95\% confidence level, representing the most stringent bound to date.</description>

      <title>ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Nested Morphological and Kinematic Structures of Outflows Revealed in SiO and CO Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) reveals complex nested morphological and kinematic features of molecular outflows through the CO (J = 2 - 1) and SiO (J = 5 - 4) emission. We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the ALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and G203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission exhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely-high-velocity (EHV) jets and shell-like low-velocity (LV) cavity walls and new features. More complex, nested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps, triangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions composed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs, are also evident. Such features find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified model of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on the PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic postshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed within the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission between the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These pseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jet-like knotty blobs, creating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is enhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jet-like excitation conditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures induced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle wind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.</description>

Abstract: "Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at $z=2.37$. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found in any other clumps. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly$\beta$ emission, as well as Ly$\alpha$-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Spectra and images of Godzilla and two faint adjacent images, and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data, support the interpretation that Godzilla is an extremely magnified object due to the alignment with lensing caustics. We find that Godzilla is part of a previously identified clump, comprising $\sim10 - 25$ % of it, with magnifications in the range of $\approx600-25,000$ depending on the models and images in comparison. The unique O I source in Godzilla is well explained by a non-erupting LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. If Godzilla is confirmed to contain an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.</description>

      <title>Close Binary Fractions in accreted and in-situ Halo Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of binary stars in the Galactic halo provides crucial insights into the dynamical history and formation processes of the Milky Way. In this work, we aim to investigate the binary fraction in a sample of accreted and in-situ halo stars, focusing on short-period binaries. Utilising data from Gaia DR3, we analysed the radial velocity (RV) uncertainty $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ distribution of a sample of main-sequence stars. We used a novel Bayesian framework to model the dependence in $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ of single and binary systems allowing us to estimate binary fractions $F$ in a sample of bright ($G_{\mathrm{RVS}}$ &lt; 12) Gaia sources. We selected the samples of in-situ and accreted halo stars based on estimating the 6D phase space information and affiliating the stars to the different samples on an action-angle vs energy ($L_{\mathrm{z}}-E$) diagram. Our results indicate a higher, though not significant, binary fraction in accreted stars compared to the in-situ halo sample. We further explore binary fractions using cuts in $E$ and $L_z$ and find a higher binary fraction in both high-energy and prograde orbits that might be explained by differences in metallicity. By cross-matching our Gaia sample with APOGEE DR17 catalogue, we confirm the results of previous studies on higher binary fractions in metal-poor stars and find the fractions of accreted and in-situ halo stars consistent with this trend. Our finding provides new insights into binary stars' formation processes and dynamical evolution in the primordial Milky Way Galaxy and its accreted dwarf Galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) are young quiescent galaxies that have recently experienced a rapid decrease in star formation, allowing us to probe the fast-quenching period of galaxy evolution. In this work, we obtained HST WFC3/F110W imaging to measure the sizes of 171 massive ($\mathrm{log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\sim\,11)}$ spectroscopically identified PSBs at $1&lt;z&lt;1.3$ selected from the DESI Survey Validation Luminous Red Galaxy sample. This statistical sample constitutes an order of magnitude increase from the $\sim20$ PSBs with space-based imaging and deep spectroscopy. We perform structural fitting of the target galaxies with \texttt{pysersic} and compare them to quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey. We find that these PSBs are more compact than the general population of quiescent galaxies, lying systematically $\mathrm{\sim\,0.1\,dex}$ below the established size-mass relation. However, their central surface mass densities are similar to those of their quiescent counterparts ($\mathrm{\,log(\Sigma_{1\,kpc}/(M_{\odot}/kpc^2))\sim\,10.1}$). These findings are easily reconciled by later ex-situ growth via minor mergers or a slight progenitor bias. These PSBs are round in projection ($b/a_{median}\sim0.8$), suggesting that they are primarily spheroids, not disks, in 3D. We find no correlation between time since quenching and light-weighted PSB sizes or central densities. This disfavors apparent structural growth due to the fading of centralized starbursts in this galaxy population. Instead, we posit that the fast quenching of massive galaxies at this epoch occurs preferentially in galaxies with pre-existing compact structures.</description>

      <title>X-ray AGN in Bo\"otes: The lack of growth of the most massive black holes since z=4</title>

Abstract: Supermassive Black Holes (BHs) are known to efficiently grow through gas accretion, but even sustained and intense mass build-up through this mechanism struggles to explain the assembly of the most massive BHs observed in the local Universe. Using the Chandra Deep-Wide Field Survey (CDFWS) in the Bo\"otes field, we measure BH--galaxy assembly in massive galaxies ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{10}\rm M_\odot$) through the AGN fraction and specific Black Hole accretion rate (sBHAR) distribution as a function of redshift and stellar mass. We determine stellar masses and star formation rates for a parent sample of optically selected galaxies as well as those with X-ray detections indicating the presence of an AGN through Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. We derive a redshift-dependent mass completeness limit and extract X-ray information for every galaxy as to provide a comprehensive picture of the AGN population in massive galaxies. While X-ray AGN samples are dominated by moderately massive host galaxies of $M_{\star} \geqslant 10^{10}\rm M_{\odot}$, we do not find a strong stellar mass dependence in AGN fraction (to limits in sBHAR), indicating a bias towards massive galaxies in the observed samples. We derive BH-galaxy growth tracks over time, which reveal that while most BH mass has been accumulated since $z=4$ for lower mass BHs, the assembly of the most massive BHs is more complex, with little to no relative mass gain since $z=4$, implying that rapid and intense growth episodes prior to $z=4$ were necessary to form these massive BHs.</description>

      <title>No evidence for a significant evolution of $M_{\bullet}$-$M_*$ relation in massive galaxies up to z$\sim$4</title>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, tight correlations between black hole masses ($M_\bullet$) and their host galaxy properties have been firmly established for massive galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\gtrsim10$) at low-$z$ ($z&lt;1$), indicating coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. However, the situation at high-$z$, especially beyond cosmic noon ($z\gtrsim2.5$), is controversial. With a combination of \emph{JWST} NIRCam/wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) from FRESCO, CONGRESS and deep multi-band NIRCam/image data from JADES in the GOODS fields, we study the black hole to galaxy mass relation at z$\sim$1--4. After identifying 18 broad-line active galactic nuclei (BL AGNs) at $1&lt;z&lt;4$ (with 8 at $z&gt;2.5$) from the WFSS data, we measure their black hole masses based on broad near-infrared lines (Pa $\alpha$, Pa $\beta$, and He\,I $\lambda$10833\,\AA), and constrain their stellar masses ($M_{*}$) from AGN-galaxy image decomposition or SED decomposition. Taking account of the observational biases, the intrinsic scatter of the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation, and the errors in mass measurements, we find no significant difference in the $M_{\bullet}/M_{*}$ ratio for 2.5 $&lt; $ z $ &lt;$ 4 compared to that at lower redshifts ($1 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$), suggesting no evolution of the $M_{\bullet} - M_{*}$ relation at $\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\gtrsim10$ up to z$\sim$4.</description>

      <title>Core Revelations: the Star Formation and AGN Connection at the Heart of NGC 7469</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation-AGN connection in the Seyfert 1 NGC 7469 using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared spectroscopic integral field unit (IFU) data. We use the IFU data to generate maps of different emission lines present in the spectrum, such as the star-formation (SF) tracer [Ne II] 12.81{\mu}m, or the AGN tracer [Ne V] 14.32{\mu}m. We can separate the AGN- and SF-dominated regions using spatially resolved mid-IR diagnostic diagrams, and further investigate the ionization sources powering each region by constructing photoionization models. We find that the previously detected eastern wind populates an intermediary region of the diagrams, between our star-forming and AGN quadrants. Although it is possible that the star forming ring may inherently not be uniform, this wind also coincides with a reduction in the [Ne II] emission in the ring, which suggests that the ionization cone intersects the ring in this direction.</description>

      <title>Galactic center G objects as dust-enshrouded stars near the supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we revisit the model of a dust-enshrouded star orbiting a low-luminosity galactic nucleus (Zaja\v{c}ek et al. 2014, 2016, 2017). Although it is quite challenging for dust to survive in hot X-ray-emitting plasma surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we now have an observational evidence that compact dusty objects or ``G'' objects can approach the SMBH in the Galactic center (Sgr A*) on the scale of a few 1000 gravitational radii. Since there are about ten G objects in the Galactic center, it is more likely that they are dust-enshrouded stars whose gaseous-dusty envelopes are stable within the corresponding tidal (Hill) radii of the order of a few astronomical units. Such a length-scale is consistent with their infrared broad-band spectral energy distributions. Broad emission lines, in particular Br$\gamma$ recombination line, can be interpreted to arise within the accretion stream from the circumstellar envelopes forming a compact disc that is truncated by the stellar magnetic field. Alternatively, they could also be associated with circumstellar accretion-disc outflows as well as the material within a denser bow shock ahead of the star. In comparison with the line origin in the photoionized envelopes that can generally be tidally stretched, the scenario involving the circumstellar accretion-disc inflow or outflow can ensure that the line luminosity is rather stable, except for the viewing-angle effects. We speculate about the origin of dust-enshrouded stars that could be young stellar objects or binary-merger products.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of S-stars from a Recent Massive Black Hole Merger in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic Center hosts a rotating disk of young stars between 0.05 and 0.5 pc of Sgr A*. The ``S-stars'' at a distance $&lt;0.04$ pc, however, are on eccentric orbits with nearly isotropically distributed inclinations. The dynamical origin of the S-star cluster has remained a theoretical challenge. Using a series of $N$-body simulations, we show that a recent massive black hole merger with Sgr A* can self-consistently produce many of the orbital properties of the Galactic nuclear star cluster within 0.5 pc. A black hole merger results in a gravitational wave recoil kick, which causes the surrounding cluster to form an apse-aligned, eccentric disk. We show that stars near the inner edge of an eccentric disk migrate inward and are driven to high eccentricities and inclinations due to secular torques similar to the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In our fiducial model, starting with a thin eccentric disk with $e = 0.3$, the initially unoccupied region within $0.04$ pc is populated with high eccentricity, high inclination S-stars within a few Myr. This dynamical channel would suggest that a black hole of mass $2^{+3}_{-1.2} \times 10^5 \ M_{\odot}$ merged with Sgr A* within the last 10 Myr.</description>

      <title>Cosmological evolution of dark matter subhaloes under tidal stripping by growing Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the findings of a comprehensive and detailed analysis of merger tree data from ultra-high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations. The analysis, conducted with a particle mass resolution of $5 \times 10^3 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and a halo mass resolution of $10^7 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, provides sufficient accuracy to suppress numerical artefacts. This study elucidates the dynamical evolution of subhaloes associated with the Milky Way-like host haloes. Unlike more massive dark matter haloes, which have been extensively studied, these subhaloes follow a distinct mass evolution pattern: an initial accretion phase, followed by a tidal stripping phase where mass is lost due to the tidal forces of the host halo. The transition from accretion to stripping, where subhaloes reach their maximum mass, occurs around a redshift of $z\simeq1$. Smaller subhaloes reach this point earlier, while larger ones do so later. Our analysis reveals that over 80 per cent of subhaloes have experienced mass loss, underscoring the universality of tidal stripping in subhalo evolution. Additionally, we derived the eccentricities and pericentre distances of subhalo orbits from the simulations and compare them with those of nearby satellite galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite. The results demonstrate a significant alignment between the orbital elements predicted by the cold dark matter model and the observed data, providing robust support for the model as a credible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>PICZL: Image-based Photometric Redshifts for AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing photo-z for AGN is challenging, primarily due to the interplay of relative emissions associated with the SMBH and its host galaxy. SED fitting methods, effective in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in all-sky surveys with fewer bands available, lacking the ability to capture the AGN contribution to the SED accurately. This limitation affects the many 10s of millions of AGN clearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA. Our goal is to significantly enhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while avoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily available data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey for DESI, covering &gt; 20,000 deg$^{2}$ with deep images and catalog-based photometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning algorithm leveraging an ensemble of CNNs. Utilizing a cross-channel approach, the algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained from catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the integration of Gaussian mixture models. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN, PICZL achieves a variance $\sigma_{\textrm{NMAD}}$ of 4.5% with an outlier fraction $\eta$ of 5.6%, outperforming previous attempts to compute accurate photo-z for AGN using ML. We highlight that the model's performance depends on many variables, predominantly the depth of the data. A thorough evaluation of these dependencies is presented in the paper. Our streamlined methodology maintains consistent performance across the entire survey area when accounting for differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep photometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for wide-scale realisation. With this paper, we release updated photo-z (including errors) for the XMM-SERVS W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1 and LSS fields.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fraction of the dense cores that form within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. To this end, here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of ``critical cores'' that are on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion constructed for individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While there exists a global linewidth--size relation for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations constructed around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse, but instead cores collapse at a wide range of densities determined by the local sonic scale, modulated by the local gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores found in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the average properties of a turbulent cloud. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Stellar Expansion or Inflation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.</description>
