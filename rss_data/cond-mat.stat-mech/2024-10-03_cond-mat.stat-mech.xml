      <title>Hard rigid rods on Husimi tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic behavior of hard rigid rods of size $k$ (i.e., $k$-mers) on four- and six-coordinated Husimi lattices (HLs), respectively built with squares (square HL) and triangles (triangular HL). In both lattices, dimers ($k=2$) and trimers ($k=3$) only present a isotropic phase, whereas a isotropic-nematic transition is observed for $k \ge 4$. In the square HL, this transition is continuous and occurs at a critical \textit{monomer} activity which displays a nonmonotonic variation with $k$, while the critical \textit{rod} activity and density are always decreasing functions of $k$. The isotropic-nematic transition is discontinuous in the triangular HL, but the $k$-dependence of the coexistence activities and density is analogous to that found for the square case. No transition from the nematic to a high-density disordered phase is found in these HLs. In general, this scenario is very similar to that already observed for rods on the Bethe lattice, though the critical parameters obtained here are in most cases closer to those reported in the literature for the square and triangular lattices. The entropy per site of fully-packed rods is also investigated in detail in the triangular HL, where its value for dimers differs by only 0.7\% from the exact result for the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Polymer dynamics under tension: mean first passage time for looping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study deals with polymer looping, an important process in many chemical and biological systems. We investigate basic questions on the looping dynamics of a polymer under tension using the freely-jointed chain (FJC) model. Previous theoretical approaches to polymer looping under tension have relied on barrier escape methods, which assume local equilibrium, an assumption that may not always hold. As a starting point we use an analytical expression for the equilibrium looping probability as a function of the number of monomers and applied force, predicting an inverse relationship between looping time and looping probability. Using molecular dynamics simulations the predictions of this theoretical approach are validated within the numerical precision achieved. We compare our predictions to those of the barrier escape approach, by way of a calculation of the mean first passage time (MFPT) for the ends of a polymer to cross. For this purpose, we derive the exact free energy landscape, but resulting temporal predictions do not agree with the observed inverse scaling. We conclude that the traditional barrier escape approach does not provide satisfactory predictions for polymer looping dynamics and that the inverse scaling with looping probability offers a more reliable alternative.</description>

      <title>First-order transition and marginal critical behavior in a novel 2D frustrated Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of a novel two-dimensional frustrated Ising model with both anti-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings is studied using Tensor-Network Renormalization-Group techniques. This model can be seen as two anti-ferromagnetic Ising replicas coupled by non-local spin-spin interactions, designed in such a way that the continuum limit matches that of the still debated J1 -J2 model and induces a marginal critical behavior. Our model has the advantage of having more symmetries than the J1 -J2 model and of allowing a more straightforward implementation of Tensor-Network Renormalization-Group algorithms We demonstrate the existence of two transition lines, featuring both first and second-order regimes. In the latter, the central charge and the critical exponents are shown to be compatible with the Ashkin-Teller universality class. This picture is consistent with that given by Monte Carlo simulations of the J1 -J2 model but not with recent studies with Tensor-Network techniques.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence and Exceptional Points for a Dimerized Hatano-Nelson Model with Staggered Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study by analytical and numerical means a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the eigenspectrum of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions as well as for the singular-value spectrum. We explicitly demonstrate the proper bulk-boundary correspondence between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values in the open case. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Locality approach to the bootstrap percolation paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Bootstrap Percolation model, leveraging recent mathematical advances linking it with its local counterpart. This new perspective resolves, for the first time, historic discrepancies between Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical results: previously, those predictions disagreed even in the first-order asymptotics of the model. In contrast, our framework achieves excellent agreement between numerics and theory, which now match up to the third-order expansion, as the infection probability approaches zero. Our algorithm allows us to generate novel predictions for the model.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Koopmanism and Response Theory: Using Natural Variability to Predict Forced Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a cornerstone result in statistical mechanics that can be used to translate the statistics of the free natural variability of a system into information on its forced response to perturbations. By combining this viewpoint on response theory with the key ingredients of Koopmanism, it is possible to deconstruct virtually any response operator into a sum of terms, each associated with a specific mode of natural variability of the system. This dramatically improves the interpretability of the resulting response formulas. We show here on three simple yet mathematically meaningful examples how to use the Extended Dynamical Mode Decomposition (EDMD) algorithm on an individual trajectory of the system to compute with high accuracy correlation functions as well as Green functions associated with acting forcings. This demonstrates the great potential of using Koopman analysis for the key problem of evaluating and testing the sensitivity of a complex system.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic corrections and criticality in the $d = 3$ Blume-Capel model: Results from small-scale Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the critical and tricritical points of the three-dimensional Blume-Capel model by analyzing the behavior of the first Lee-Yang zero, the density of partition function zeros, and higher-order cumulants of the magnetization. Our analysis is conducted through Monte Carlo simulations, intentionally using only small system sizes. We demonstrate that this approach yields excellent results for studying the critical behavior of the model. Our findings indicate that at the tricritical point, where logarithmic corrections are anticipated, the numerical results align closely with the theoretical exponents describing these corrections. These expected values are then employed to accurately determine the coordinates of the tricritical point. At the model's critical point, the corrections correspond to those of the three-dimensional Ising model criticality, which we also use to precisely ascertain the critical temperature at zero crystal field. Additionally, we utilize more traditional thermodynamic quantities to validate the self-consistency of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Integrable Matrix Probabilistic Diffusions and the Matrix Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a matrix version of the stochastic heat equation, the MSHE, and obtain its explicit invariant measure in spatial dimension $D=1$. We show that it is classically integrable in the weak-noise regime, in terms of the matrix extension of the imaginary-time $1D$ nonlinear Schrodinger equation which allows us to study its short-time large deviations through inverse scattering. The MSHE can be viewed as a continuum limit of the matrix log Gamma polymer on the square lattice introduced recently. We also show classical integrability of that discrete model, as well as of other extensions such as of the semi-discrete matrix O'Connell-Yor polymer and the matrix strict-weak polymer. For all these models, we obtain the Lax pairs of their weak-noise regime, as well as the invariant measure, using a fluctuation--dissipation transformation on the dynamical action.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully Bayesian treatment of complicated predictive models (such as deep neural networks) would enable rigorous uncertainty quantification and the automation of higher-level tasks including model selection. However, the intractability of sampling Bayesian posteriors over many parameters inhibits the use of Bayesian methods where they are most needed. Thermodynamic computing has emerged as a paradigm for accelerating operations used in machine learning, such as matrix inversion, and is based on the mapping of Langevin equations to the dynamics of noisy physical systems. Hence, it is natural to consider the implementation of Langevin sampling algorithms on thermodynamic devices. In this work we propose electronic analog devices that sample from Bayesian posteriors by realizing Langevin dynamics physically. Circuit designs are given for sampling the posterior of a Gaussian-Gaussian model and for Bayesian logistic regression, and are validated by simulations. It is shown, under reasonable assumptions, that the Bayesian posteriors for these models can be sampled in time scaling with $\ln(d)$, where $d$ is dimension. For the Gaussian-Gaussian model, the energy cost is shown to scale with $ d \ln(d)$. These results highlight the potential for fast, energy-efficient Bayesian inference using thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of the flexural Ising model in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the compressible Ising model in which spins are hosted on an elastic $D$-dimensional lattice embedded in $d&gt;D$ dimensions is studied. Two critical systems interact when temperature is tuned to the Ising transition point, as a freely-fluctuating thermalized crystalline membrane in its flat phase is already critical. Noting that the upper critical dimension of both the membrane and Ising model is $D_{uc}=4$, renormalization group recursion relations are found by expanding in $\epsilon=4-D$. The coupling between spin and elastic degrees of freedom is shown to be a relevant operator for the physical case of a two-dimensional membrane fluctuating in three-dimensional space ($D=2$, $d=3$), which suggests that the thermalized membrane and Ising systems become more strongly coupled at long wavelengths. The coupling is irrelevant when the difference between the space dimension and membrane dimension is greater than twelve.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry in the Landau Level Problem with a Disorder Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a supersymmetric (SUSY) theory that arises in the Landau level problem with disorder. Charged particles in a strong magnetic field and a local potential are described by small excitations around the ground state, the lowest Landau level (LLL). Around forty years ago Br\'ezin, Gross and Itzykson showed that for a disorder potential certain observables in the LLL limit are described by a chiral SUSY theory. As a consequence, the problem undergoes a dimensional reduction by two dimensions, simplifying the computations. We generalize their findings by identifying the chiral SUSY as a special limit of a `magnetic Parisi-Sourlas (PS)' theory. The latter is a modification of the theories associated to fixed points of random field models. We show that the SUSY features extend to a much larger class of observables and to higher Landau levels. Finally we identify a set of new super-Ward identities and show how observables in the disordered theory must satisfy them.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in Ferromagnetic $q-$state Models: Contours, Long-Range Interactions and Decaying Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the group structure of the state space of $q-$state models and a new definition of contour for long-range spin-systems in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with $d\geq 2$, a multidimensional version of Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer contours, we prove the phase transition for a class of ferromagnetic long-range systems which includes the Clock and Potts models. Our arguments work for the entire region of exponents of regular power-law interactions, namely $\alpha &gt; d$, and for any $q \geq 2$. As an application, we prove the phase transition for Potts models with decaying fields when the field decays fast enough.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While "complexity science" has achieved significant successes in several interdisciplinary fields such as economics and biology, it is only a very recent observation that legal systems -- from the way legal texts are drafted and connected to the rest of the corpus, up to the level of how judges and courts reach decisions under a variety of conflicting inputs -- share several features with standard Complex Adaptive Systems. This review is meant as a gentle introduction to the use of quantitative tools and techniques of complexity science to describe, analyse, and tame the complex web of human interactions that the Law is supposed to regulate. We offer an overview of the main directions of research undertaken so far as well as an outlook for future research, and we argue that statistical physicists and complexity scientists should not ignore the opportunities offered by the cross-fertilisation between legal scholarship and complex-systems modelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing probability distributions from experimental data is a crucial problem across various fields. An effective approach is to optimize a theoretical or computational model of the distribution under an objective functional that evaluates consistency with the experimental data. However, achieving convergence in optimization remains a challenge. Given the manifold structure of the probability distribution space, we demonstrate that transformation of distribution in optimization should be infinitesimal displacements along exponential geodesics. Our theory was validated through the reconstruction of protein conformational ensembles, showing its broad applicability.</description>

Abstract: We follow the Boltzmann-Clausius-Maxwell (BCM) proposal to solve a long-standing problem of identifying the underlying cause of the second law (SL) of spontaneous irreversibility, a stochastic universal principle, as the mechanical equilibrium (stable or unstable) principle (Mec-EQ-P) of analytical mechanics of an isolated nonequilibrium system of any size. The principle leads to nonnegative system intrinsic (SI) microwork and SI-average macrowork dW during any spontaneous process. In conjuction with the first law, Mec-EQ-P leads to a generalized second law (GSL) dQ=dW&gt;0, where dQ=TdS is the purely stochastic SI-macroheat that corresponds to dS&gt;0 for T&gt;0 and dS&lt;0 for T&lt;0, where T is the temperature. The GSL supercedes the conventional SL formulation that is valid only for a macroscopic system for positive temperatures temperatures, but reformulates it to dS&lt;0 for negative temperatures. It is quite surprising that GSL is not only a direct consequence of intertwined mechanical and stochastic macroquantities through the first law but also remains valid for any arbitrary irreversible process in a system of any size as an identity for positive and negative temperatures. It also becomes a no-go theorem for GSL-violation unless we abandon Mec-EQ-P of analytical mechanics used in the BCM proposal, which will be catastrophic for theoretical physics. In addition, Mec-EQ-P also provides new insights into the roles of spontaneity, nonspontaneity, negative temperatures, instability, and the significance of dS&lt;0 due to nonspontaneity and inserting internal constraints.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures of discontinuous phase transitions: How phase coexistence determines exponential versus power-law scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the finite-size scaling of the Liouvillian gap and dynamical fluctuations at discontinuous phase transitions, with various studies reporting either exponential or power-law behavior. We clarify this issue by employing large deviation theory. We distinguish two distinct classes of discontinuous phase transitions that have different dynamical properties. The first class is associated with phase coexistence, i.e., the presence of multiple stable attractors of the system dynamics (e.g., local minima of the free energy functional) in a finite phase diagram region around the phase transition point. In that case, one observes asymptotic exponential scaling related to stochastic switching between attractors (though the onset of exponential scaling may sometimes occur for very large system sizes). In the second class, there is no phase coexistence away from the phase transition point, while at the phase transition point itself there are infinitely many attractors. In that case, one observes power-law scaling related to the diffusive nature of the system relaxation to the stationary state.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion in confining potentials: non-equilibrium distribution tails and optimal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At long times, a fractional Brownian particle in a confining external potential reaches a non-equilibrium (non-Boltzmann) steady state. Here we consider scale-invariant power-law potentials $V(x)\sim |x|^m$, where $m&gt;0$, and employ the optimal fluctuation method (OFM) to determine the large-$|x|$ tails of the steady-state probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(x)$ of the particle position. The calculations involve finding the optimal (that is, the most likely) path of the particle, which determines these tails, via a minimization of the exact action functional for this system, which has recently become available. Exploiting dynamical scale invariance of the model in conjunction with the OFM ansatz, we establish the large-$|x|$ tails of $\ln \mathcal{P}(x)$ up to a dimensionless factor $\alpha(H,m)$, where $0&lt;H&lt;1$ is the Hurst exponent. We determine $\alpha(H,m)$ analytically (i) in the limits of $H\to 0$ and $H\to 1$, and (ii) for $m=2$ and arbitrary $H$, corresponding to the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. Our results for the fOU process are in agreement with the previously known exact $\mathcal{P}(x)$ and autocovariance. The form of the tails of $\mathcal{P}(x)$ yields exact conditions, in terms of $H$ and $m$, for the particle confinement in the potential. For $H\neq 1/2$, the tails encode the non-equilibrium character of the steady state distribution, and we observe violation of time reversibility of the system except for $m=2$. To compute the optimal paths and the factor $\alpha(H,m)$ for arbitrary permissible $H$ and $m$, one needs to solve an (in general nonlinear) integro-differential equation. To this end we develop a specialized numerical iteration algorithm which accounts analytically for an intrinsic cusp singularity of the optimal paths for $H&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in $q$-state clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q-$state clock model, sometimes called the discrete $XY$ model, is known to show a second-order (symmetry breaking) phase transition in two-dimension (2D) for $q\le 4$ ($q=2$ corresponds to the Ising model). On the other hand, the $q\to\infty$ limit of the model corresponds to the $XY$ model, which shows the infinite order (non-symmetry breaking) Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in 2D. Interestingly, the 2D clock model with $q\ge 5$ is predicted to show three different phases and two associated phase transitions. There are varying opinions about the actual characters of phases and the associated transitions. In this work, we develop the basic and higher-order mean-field (MF) theories to study the $q$-state clock model systematically. Our MF calculations reaffirm that, for large $q$, there are three phases: (broken) $\mathbb{Z}_q$ symmetric ferromagnetic phase at the low temperature, emergent $U(1)$ symmetric BKT phase at the intermediate temperature, and paramagnetic (disordered) phase at the high temperature. The phase transition at the higher temperature is found to be of the BKT type, and the other transition at the lower temperature is argued to be a large-order spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) type (the largeness of transition order yields the possibility of having some of the numerical characteristics of a BKT transition). The higher-order MF theory developed here better characterizes phases by estimating the spin-spin correlation between two neighbors.</description>

      <title>Branching States as The Emergent Structure of a Quantum Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism builds on decoherence theory to explain the emergence of classical behavior in a fundamentally quantum universe. Within this framework we prove two crucial insights about the emergence of classical phenomenology, centered around quantum discord as the measure of quantumness of correlations. First, we show that the so-called branching structure of the joint state of the system and environment is the only one compatible with zero discord. Second, we prove that for small but nonzero discord and for good but not perfect decoherence, the structure of the globally pure state must be arbitrarily close to the branching form, with each branch exhibiting low entanglement. Our results significantly improve on previous bounds and reinforce the existing evidence that this class of branching states is the only one compatible with the emergence of classical phenomenology, as described by Quantum Darwinism.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism for a Quenched Quantum Inverted Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-dependent behaviour of quantum correlations of a system of an inverted oscillator governed by out-of-equilibrium dynamics using the well-known Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in presence of quantum mechanical quench. Considering a generalized structure of a time-dependent Hamiltonian for an inverted oscillator system, we use the invariant operator method to obtain its eigenstates and continuous energy eigenvalues. Using the expression for the eigenstates, we further derive the most general expression for the generating function as well as the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) for the given system using this formalism. Further, considering the time-dependent coupling and frequency of the quantum inverted oscillator characterized by quench parameters, we comment on the dynamical behaviour, specifically the early, intermediate and late time-dependent features of the OTOC for the quenched quantum inverted oscillator. Next, we study a specific case, where the system of inverted oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviour by computing the quantum Lyapunov exponent from the time-dependent behaviour of OTOC in presence of the given quench profile.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions from conformal field theory: generalized $\phi^{2n+1}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate $\phi^{2n+1}$ deformations of the generalized free theory in the $\epsilon$ expansion, where the canonical kinetic term is generalized to a higher-derivative version. For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet recombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the fundamental scalar operator $\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators $\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with $S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\phi$ is promoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots and their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n&gt;1$, the leading anomalous dimensions of $\phi$ and $ \mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and contain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed by the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing symmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.</description>
