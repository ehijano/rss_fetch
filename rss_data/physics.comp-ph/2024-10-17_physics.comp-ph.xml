      <title>Stochastic Operator Learning for Chemistry in Non-Equilibrium Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for physically consistent model error characterization and operator learning for reduced-order models of non-equilibrium chemical kinetics. By leveraging the Bayesian framework, we identify and infer sources of model and parametric uncertainty within the Coarse-Graining Methodology across a range of initial conditions. The model error is embedded into the chemical kinetics model to ensure that its propagation to quantities of interest remains physically consistent. For operator learning, we develop a methodology that separates time dynamics from other input parameters. Karhunen-Loeve Expansion (KLE) is employed to capture time dynamics, yielding temporal modes, while Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is subsequently used to map model error and input parameters to KLE coefficients. The proposed model offers three significant advantages: i) Separating time dynamics from other inputs ensures stability of chemistry surrogate when coupled with fluid solvers; ii) The framework fully accounts for model and parametric uncertainty, enabling robust probabilistic predictions; iii) The surrogate model is highly interpretable, with visualizable time modes and a PCE component that facilitates analytical calculation of sensitivity indices. We apply this framework to O2-O chemistry system under hypersonic flight conditions, validating it in both a 0D adiabatic reactor and coupled simulations with a fluid solver in a 1D shock case. Results demonstrate that the surrogate is stable during time integration, delivers physically consistent probabilistic predictions accounting for model and parametric uncertainty, and achieves maximum relative error below 10%. This work represents a significant step forward in enabling probabilistic predictions of non-equilibrium chemistry with coupled fluid solvers, offering a physically accurate approach for hypersonic flow predictions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Radiative Transfers Interactions with Material Ablative Response for Hypersonic Atmospheric Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer interactions with material ablation are critical contributors to vehicle heating during high-altitude, high-velocity atmospheric entry. However, the inherent complexity of fully coupled multi-physics models often necessitates simplifying assumptions, which may overlook key phenomena that significantly affect heat loads, particularly radiative heating. Common approximations include neglecting the contribution of ablation products, applying simplified frozen wall boundary conditions, or treating radiative transfer in a loosely coupled manner. This study introduces a high-fidelity, tightly coupled multi-solver framework designed to accurately capture the multi-physics challenges of hypersonic flow around an ablative body. The proposed approach consistently accounts for the interactions between shock-heated gases, surface material response, and radiative transfer. Our results demonstrate that including radiative heating in the surface energy balance substantially influences the ablation rate. Ablation products are shown to absorb radiative heat flux in the vacuum-ultraviolet spectrum along the stagnation line, while strongly emitting in off-stagnation regions. These findings emphasize the necessity of a tightly coupled multiphysics framework to faithfully capture the complex, multidimensional interactions in hypersonic flow environments, which conventional, loosely coupled models fail to represent accurately.</description>

      <title>Differential Shape Optimization with Image Representation for Photonic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for differentiating shapes represented in binary images with respect to their parameters. This framework functions as an automatic differentiation tool for shape parameters, generating both binary density maps for optical simulations and computing gradients when the simulation provides a gradient of the density map. Our algorithm enables robust gradient computation that is insensitive to the image's pixel resolution and is compatible with all density-based simulation methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and generalizability of our differential shape algorithm using photonic designs with different shape parametrizations across several differentiable optical solvers. We also demonstrate a substantial reduction in optimization time using our gradient-based shape optimization framework compared to traditional black-box optimization methods.</description>

      <title>On the new and accurate (Goudsmit-Saunderson) model for describing e-/e+ multiple Coulomb scattering (Geant4 Technical Note)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model, for the accurate simulation of multiple Coulomb scattering (MSC) of e-/e+, has been implemented in Geant4 recently and made available with version Geant4-10.4. The model is based on Goudsmit-Saunderson (GS) angular distributions computed by utilising the screen Rutherford (SR) DCS and follows very closely the formulation developed by Kawrakow [1, 2] and utilised in the EGSnrc toolkit [3]. Corrections, for taking into accountenergy loss [2] neglected by the GS theory, spin-relativistic effects [3] not included in the SR but might be accounted on the basis of Mott DCS as well as the so-called scattering power correction [4], i.e. appropriately incorporating deflections due to sub-threshold delta ray productions, are all included similarly to the EGSnrc model [3]. Furthermore, an accurate electron-step algorithm [5, 6, 2] is utilised for path length correction, i.e. for calculating the post-step position in each condensed history simulation steps such that the corresponding single-scattering longitudinal and lateral (post step point) distributions are very well reproduced. An e-/e+ stepping algorithm, including the simulation step-limit due to the MSC and boundary crossing [2]), free from step-size artefacts, makes the model complete. Details on this new model, including all the above-mentioned components and corrections, are provided in this Geant4 technical note.
  It must be noted, that a Goudsmit-Saunderson model for MSC was available before Geant4-10.4., documented in [7], that has been completely replaced by the model described in this technical note (keeping only the G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel name of the C++ class from that previous version)</description>

      <title>Federated scientific machine learning for approximating functions and solving differential equations with data heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging neural networks, the emerging field of scientific machine learning (SciML) offers novel approaches to address complex problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In practical applications, challenges arise due to the distributed essence of data, concerns about data privacy, or the impracticality of transferring large volumes of data. Federated learning (FL), a decentralized framework that enables the collaborative training of a global model while preserving data privacy, offers a solution to the challenges posed by isolated data pools and sensitive data issues. Here, this paper explores the integration of FL and SciML to approximate complex functions and solve differential equations. We propose two novel models: federated physics-informed neural networks (FedPINN) and federated deep operator networks (FedDeepONet). We further introduce various data generation methods to control the degree of non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data and utilize the 1-Wasserstein distance to quantify data heterogeneity in function approximation and PDE learning. We systematically investigate the relationship between data heterogeneity and federated model performance. Additionally, we propose a measure of weight divergence and develop a theoretical framework to establish growth bounds for weight divergence in federated learning compared to traditional centralized learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, we conducted 10 experiments, including 2 on function approximation, 5 PDE problems on FedPINN, and 3 PDE problems on FedDeepONet. These experiments demonstrate that proposed federated methods surpass the models trained only using local data and achieve competitive accuracy of centralized models trained using all data.</description>

      <title>Multihyperuniformity in high entropy MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MXenes are a large family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides that possess excellent electrical conductivity, high volumetric capacitance, great mechanical properties, and hydrophilicity. In this work, we generalize the concept of multihyperuniformity (MH), an exotic state that can exist in a disordered multi-component system, to two-dimensional materials MXenes. Disordered hyperuniform systems possess an isotropic local structure that lacks traditional translational and orientational order, yet they completely suppress infinite-wavelength density fluctuations as in perfect crystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range order. In particular, we evaluate the static structure factor of the individual components present in the high entropy (HE) MXene experimental sample TiVCMoCr based on high-solution SEM imaging data, which suggests this HE MXene system is at least effectively multihyperuniform. We then devise a packing algorithm to generate multihyperuniform models of HE MXene systems. The MH HE MXenes are predicted to be energetically more stable compared to the prevailing (quasi)random models of the HE MXenes due to the hidden long-range order. Moreover, the MH structure exhibits a distinctly smaller lattice distortion, which has a vital effect on the electronic properties of HE MXenes, such as the density of states and charge distribution. This systematic study of HE MXenes strengthens our fundamental understanding of these systems, and suggests possible exotic physical properties, as endowed by the multihyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>From PINNs to PIKANs: Recent Advances in Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a key tool in Scientific Machine Learning since their introduction in 2017, enabling the efficient solution of ordinary and partial differential equations using sparse measurements. Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the training and optimization of PINNs, covering aspects such as network architectures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition, and the use of adaptive weights and activation functions. A notable recent development is the Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANS), which leverage a representation model originally proposed by Kolmogorov in 1957, offering a promising alternative to traditional PINNs. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in PINNs, focusing on improvements in network design, feature expansion, optimization techniques, uncertainty quantification, and theoretical insights. We also survey key applications across a range of fields, including biomedicine, fluid and solid mechanics, geophysics, dynamical systems, heat transfer, chemical engineering, and beyond. Finally, we review computational frameworks and software tools developed by both academia and industry to support PINN research and applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation of longitudinal Landau damping in bunches with space charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a single hadron bunch affected by longitudinal space charge in a stationary rf bucket we analyze the frequency spectrum close to the expected loss of Landau damping for the lowest order dipole mode. For different bunch intensity parameters we obtain the bunch oscillation spectrum from a conventional longitudinal particle tracking code with a grid-based space charge solver. We validate selected results against a grid-less space charge solver. We highlight the importance of the choice of the cut-off parameter $h_c$ in the space charge impedance for the long-term accuracy of grid-based schemes. For typical bunch parameters in an ion synchrotron at injection energies we find that the branching point, where the dipole mode frequency emerges from the incoherent synchrotron frequency spectrum, as well as the damping of the dipole mode do not depend on $h_c$, chosen well below the actual value for realistic beam pipes.</description>

      <title>Solving eigenvalue problems obtained by the finite element method on a quantum annealer using only a few qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main obstacles for achieving a practical quantum advantage in quantum computing lies in the relatively small number of qubits currently available in quantum hardware. Here, we show how to circumvent this problem in the context of eigenvalue problems obtained by the finite element method, via the use of an adaptive algorithm for quantum annealers -- the Adaptive Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (AQAE) -- in a way that only a few qubits are required to achieve a high precision. As an example, we apply AQAE to eigenvalue problems that are relevant in a wide range of contexts, such as electromagnetism, acoustics and seismology, and quantify its robustness against different types of experimental errors. Our approach could be applied to other algorithms, and makes it possible to take the most of current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Vortex Detection in Atomic 2D Bose Gases in the Presence of a Phononic Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices play a crucial role in both equilibrium and dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) superfluid systems. Experimental detection of these excitations in 2D ultracold atomic gases typically involves careful labelling of density depletions in absorption images following short time-of-flight expansions, however the presence of a significant phononic background renders the problem challenging, often beyond the capability of simple algorithms or the human eye. Here, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect vortices in the presence of strong long- and intermediate-length scale density modulations in finite-temperature 2D Bose gases. We train the model on datasets obtained from ab initio Monte Carlo simulations using the classical-field method for density and phase fluctuations, and Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of realistic expansion dynamics. We benchmark the performance of our method by comparing it to the matter-wave interferometric detection of vortices, confirming the observed scaling of vortex density across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical point. The combination of a relevant simulation pipeline with machine-learning methods is a key development towards the comprehensive understanding of complex vortex-phonon dynamics in out-of-equilibrium 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Model for Constructing Reaction Path from Initial to Final States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping the chemical reaction pathways and their corresponding activation barriers is a significant challenge in molecular simulation. Given the inherent complexities of 3D atomic geometries, even generating an initial guess of these paths can be difficult for humans. This paper presents an innovative approach that utilizes neural networks to generate initial guesses for reaction pathways based on the initial state and learning from a database of low-energy transition paths. The proposed method is initiated by inputting the coordinates of the initial state, followed by progressive alterations to its structure. This iterative process culminates in the generation of the guess reaction path and the coordinates of the final state. The method does not require one-the-fly computation of the actual potential energy surface, and is therefore fast-acting. The application of this geometry-based method extends to complex reaction pathways illustrated by organic reactions. Training was executed on the Transition1x dataset of organic reaction pathways. The results revealed the generation of reactions that bore substantial similarities with the test set of chemical reaction paths. The method's flexibility allows for reactions to be generated either to conform to predetermined conditions or in a randomized manner.</description>

      <title>Flow and clogging of capillary droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capillary droplets form due to surface tension when two immiscible fluids are mixed. We describe the motion of gravity-driven capillary droplets flowing through narrow constrictions and obstacle arrays in both simulations and experiments. Our new capillary deformable particle model recapitulates the shape and velocity of single oil droplets in water as they pass through narrow constrictions in microfluidic chambers. Using this experimentally validated model, we simulate the flow and clogging of single capillary droplets in narrow channels and obstacle arrays and find several important results. First, the capillary droplet speed profile is nonmonotonic as the droplet exits the narrow orifice, and we can tune the droplet properties so that the speed overshoots the terminal speed far from the constriction. Second, in obstacle arrays, we find that extremely deformable droplets can wrap around obstacles, which leads to decreased average droplet speed in the continuous flow regime and increased probability for clogging in the regime where permanent clogs form. Third, the wrapping mechanism causes the clogging probability in obstacle arrays to become nonmonotonic with surface tension $\Gamma$. At large $\Gamma$, the droplets are nearly rigid and the clogging probability is large since the droplets can not squeeze through the gaps between obstacles. With decreasing $\Gamma$, the clogging probability decreases as the droplets become more deformable. However, in the small-$\Gamma$ limit the clogging probability increases, since the droplets are extremely deformable and cause clogs as they wrap around the obstacles. The results from these studies are important for developing a predictive understanding of capillary droplet flows through complex and confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Palabos Turret: A Particle-Resolved Numerical Framework for Settling Dynamics of Arbitrary-Shaped Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles transported in fluids are everywhere, occurring for example in indoor air, the atmosphere, the oceans, and engineering applications. In this study, a novel three-dimensional numerical framework -- the Palabos Turret is presented, which allows fully resolved simulations of the settling dynamics of heavy particles with arbitrary shapes over a wide range of particle Reynolds numbers. The numerical solver is based on the lattice Boltzmann method utilizing immersed-boundary approach and a recursive-regularized collision model to fully resolve the particle-fluid interactions. A predictor-corrector scheme is applied for the robust time integration of the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) rigid-body motion. Finally, the multi-scale nature arising from the long free-fall distances of a particle is addressed through a dynamic memory allocation scheme allowing for a virtually infinite falling distance. This solver allows for the simulation of particles of any arbitrary shape. The proposed framework is validated using the analytical and experimental data of freely-falling spheres, ellipsoids, and an irregular particle in a wide range of Reynolds numbers between $5\times10^{-1}$ and $4\times10^4$. For different Reynolds numbers and particle shapes considered, the Palabos Turret shows excellent agreement compared to theoretical and experimental values with a median relative deviation of $\pm1.5\%$ and a maximum deviation of $\pm5\%$. The Palabos Turret enables an in-depth analysis of the translational and rotational dynamics of particles with complex geometries.</description>

Abstract: In the canonical approach of loop quantum gravity, arguably the most important outstanding problem is finding and interpreting solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint. In this work, we demonstrate that methods of machine learning are in principle applicable to this problem. We consider $U(1)$ BF theory in 3 dimensions, quantized with loop quantum gravity methods. In particular, we formulate a master constraint corresponding to Hamilton and Gauss constraints using loop quantum gravity methods. To make the problem amenable for numerical simulation we fix a graph and introduce a cutoff on the kinematical degrees of freedom, effectively considering $U_q(1)$ BF theory at a root of unity. We show that the Neural Network Quantum State (NNQS) ansatz can be used to numerically solve the constraints efficiently and accurately. We compute expectation values and fluctuations of certain observables and compare them with exact results or exact numerical methods where possible. We also study the dependence on the cutoff.</description>

      <title>Scalable Training of Trustworthy and Energy-Efficient Predictive Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12909</link>

Abstract: We present our work on developing and training scalable, trustworthy, and energy-efficient predictive graph foundation models (GFMs) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 Graphic Compute Dies (GCDs) on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Each HPO trial was ranked based on both accuracy and energy consumption. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures (selected with judicious balance between accuracy and energy consumption) continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contributions establish core capabilities for rapidly developing, training, and deploying further GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>Generalized convolutional many body distribution functional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20471</link>

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) models of chemical and materials systems with billions of parameters require vast training datasets and considerable computational efforts. Lightweight kernel or decision tree based methods, however, can be rapidly trained, leading to a considerably lower carbon footprint. We introduce generalized convolutional many-body distribution functionals (cMBDF) as highly compute and data efficient atomic representations for accurate kernels that excel in low-data regimes. Generalizing the MBDF framework, cMBDF encodes local chemical environments in a compact fashion using translationally and rotationally invariant functionals of smooth atom centered Gaussian electron density proxy distributions weighted by interaction potentials. The functional values can be efficiently evaluated by expressing them in terms of convolutions which are calculated via fast Fourier transforms and stored on pre-defined grids. In the generalized form each atomic environment is described using a set of functionals uniformly defined by three integers; many-body, derivative, weighting orders. Irrespective of size/composition, cMBDF atomic vectors remain compact and constant in size for a fixed choice of these orders controlling the structural and compositional resolution. While being up to two orders of magnitude more compact than other popular representations, cMBDF is shown to be more accurate for the learning of various quantum properties such as energies, dipole moments, homo-lumo gaps, heat-capacity, polarizability, optimal exact-exchange admixtures and basis-set scaling factors. Applicability for organic and inorganic chemistry is tested as represented by the QM7b, QM9 and VQM24 data sets. Due to its compactness, model training and testing times are reduced from 23 hours to 8 minutes, implying a corresponding reduction in carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Data Efficiency in $\Delta$-ML and Multifidelity Models for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) methods has made quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible by reducing the compute cost incurred in conventional QC methods. This has since been translated into the overhead cost of generating training data. Increased work in reducing the cost of generating training data resulted in the development of $\Delta$-ML and multifidelity machine learning methods which use data at more than one QC level of accuracy, or fidelity. This work compares the data costs associated with $\Delta$-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML (o-MFML) in contrast with a newly introduced Multifidelity$\Delta$-Machine Learning (MF$\Delta$ML) method for the prediction of ground state energies over the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression (KRR) case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard $\Delta$-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. For cases, where $\Delta$-ML method might be favored, such as small test set regimes, the MF$\Delta$-ML method is shown to be more efficient than conventional $\Delta$-ML.</description>
