      <title>T-Minkowski noncommutative spacetimes II: classical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly charging the conformally dressed black holes preserving duality and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start this paper by concisely rederiving ModMax, which is nothing but the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's equations preserving conformal and duality invariance. The merit of this new derivation is its transparency and simplicity since it is based on an approach where the elusive duality invariance is manifest. In the second part, we couple the ModMax electrodynamics to Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant together with a standard conformal scalar field, and new stationary spacetimes with dyonic charges are found. These solutions are later used as seed configurations to generate nonlinearly charged (super-)renormalizably dressed spacetimes by means of a known generating method that we extend to include any nonlinear conformal electrodynamics. We end by addressing the issue of how to generalize some of these results to include the recently studied non-Noetherian conformal scalar fields, whose equation of motion still enjoys conformal symmetry even though its action does not. It results that the static non-Noetherian conformally dressed black holes also become amenable to being charged by ModMax.</description>

      <title>Enumerating 6D supergravities with $T\leq 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of 6D supergravities with minimal supersymmetry is greatly constrained by anomaly cancellation. Nevertheless, a large number of models satisfy all low-energy consistency conditions and in this work we make progress towards exhaustively enumerating all anomaly-free models with at most one tensor multiplet. Generalizing previous techniques, we describe a general algorithm using multi-hypergraphs and simplicial complexes to systematically enumerate anomaly-free models with gauge groups of any number of simple factors and with hypermultiplets falling into any representations. Using these new ideas, we obtain a \emph{complete} list of anomaly-free models for $T\leq 1$, the only simplifying assumption being that the gauge group contains no $\operatorname{U}(1)$, $\operatorname{SU}(2)$, $\operatorname{SU}(3)$ or $\operatorname{Sp}(2)$ factors. We also study how many/which models in this ensemble satisfy several UV and swampland bounds which have been proposed and previously utilized to great effect, finding that none are ruled out for $T=0$ and $\approx\!50\%$ are inconsistent with quantum gravity for $T=1$.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of regular spinor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Lounesto classification, there are three types of regular spinors. They are classified by the condition that at least one of the scalar or pseudo scalar norms are non-vanishing. The Dirac spinors are regular spinors because their scalar and pseudo scalar norms are non-zero and zero respectively. We construct local and Lorentz-covariant fermionic fields from all three classes of regular spinors. By computing the invariants and bilinear covariants of the regular spinor fields, we show that they are physically equivalent to the Dirac fields in the sense that whatever interactions one writes down using the regular spinor fields, they can always be expressed in terms of the Dirac fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present higher-derivative deformations of the ModMax theory which preserve both $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality symmetry and Weyl invariance. In particular, we single out a class of deformations expected to describe a low-energy effective action for the ModMax theory. We also elaborate on higher-derivative deformations of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ super ModMax theory.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of renormalization group flow, Perelman's entropy functional, and emergent dual holography in the worldsheet nonlinear $\sigma$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the renormalization group (RG) flow of worldsheet bosonic string theory, we construct an effective holographic dual description, where an extra dimension is identified with an RG scale. As a result, we obtain a dilaton-gravity effective theory for the dynamics of an emergent target spacetime, analogous to the low-energy description of bosonic M theory. We argue that this holographic dual effective field theory is non-perturbative in nature for the $\alpha'$ expansion, where the RG flow of the target spacetime manifests in the level of an effective bulk action. Based on the holographic dual effective field theory, we investigate the monotonicity of the RG flow. Inspired by the monotonicity of the Ricci flow given by Perelman, we propose a holographic construction of the Perelman's entropy functional. Based on the equivalence between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the local RG equation, we show that the RG flow of holographic Perelman's entropy functional is nothing but the Weyl anomaly. This leads us to the monotonicity of the RG flow of the emergent target spacetime. Furthermore, considering the entropy production along the RG flow, we construct a microscopic entropy functional based on the probability distribution function of the holographic dual effective field theory, regarded as Gibbs or Shannon entropy. We find that the monotonicity of this microscopically constructed entropy functional shows a strong connection with the monotonicity of the holographic Perelman's entropy functional.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Gravity, Dark Energy and Conformal Symmetry: Testing the Hierarchies of Anomaly-Induced Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal back-reaction generates cosmological models where the trace anomaly reflects the breaking of Weyl invariance. Analyzing these actions yields a dynamic approach to dark energy through anomaly-induced actions (AIAs), that are variational solutions of the trace anomaly functional constraint. Expanded around Minkowski space, they produce semiclassical correlators subject to hierarchical anomalous Ward identities, tied to conformal symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance. We focus on comparing the hierarchy of a specific 4-point function, particularly the 2-gravitons-2-photons correlator $(TTJJ)$, generated by AIAs, to free field theory realizations of the same correlator. We observe that the free field theory original hierarchy splits into one ordinary and one anomalous hierarchy, both satisfying the conservation Ward identities from diffeomorphism invariance. However, we find that the anomalous hierarchy derived from ordinary AIAs in both the Riegert or Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauges, are either affected by double poles or violate the hierarchy of the trace Ward identity, respectively. We show that correct forms of the anomalous hierarchies of 4-point functions (for the $TTTT$ and $TTJJ$), identified in a perturbative free field theory expansion around flat space, are characterised by anomaly poles, corresponding to a curvature expansion in $R\Box^{-1}$, together with Weyl invariant terms. We derive the effective action that generates the correct form of the hierarchy for the $TTJJ$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators with Double Massive Exchanges: Bootstrap Equation and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recently developed cosmological bootstrap method, we compute the exact analytical solution for the seed integral appearing in cosmological correlators with double massive scalar exchanges. The result is explicit, valid in any kinematic configuration, and free from spurious divergences. It is applicable to any number of fields' species with any masses. With an appropriate choice of variables, the results contain only single-layer summations. We also propose simple approximate formulas valid in different limits, enabling direct and instantaneous evaluation.Supported by exact numerical results using CosmoFlow, we explore the phenomenology of double massive exchange diagrams. Contrary to single-exchange diagrams with ubiquitous Lorentz-covariant interactions, the size of the cubic coupling constant can be large while respecting perturbativity bounds. Because of this property, the primordial bispectrum from double-exchange diagrams can be as large as, coincidentally, current observational constraints. In addition to being sizable on equilateral configurations, we show that the primordial bispectrum exhibits a large cosmological collider signal in the squeezed limit, making the double massive exchanges interesting channels for the detection of massive primordial fields. We propose to decisively disentangle double-exchange channels from single-exchange ones with cosmological observations by exploiting the phase information of the cosmological collider signal, the inflationary flavor oscillations from multiple fields' species exchanges and the double soft limit in the primordial trispectrum.</description>

      <title>An $S^3\times S^3$ bundle over $S^4$ and new supergravity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric of $S^7$ can be written as an $SU(2)$-instanton bundle over $S^4$. It is also possible to write it differently as an anti-instanton bundle. We use this observation to construct an instanton--anti-instanton, $SU(2)\times SU(2)$, bundle over $S^4$. We show that this 10d manifold admits two Einstein metrics. We then rewrite the metric to isolate two $U(1)$ directions of the fibre and dimensionally reduce along them to get an eight dimensional metric describing an $S^2\times S^2$ bundle over $S^4$. This metric allows a harmonic 4-form which we use to derive new supergravity solutions in eleven and ten dimensions as $AdS_3\times M_8$ and $AdS_2\times M_8$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scattering on the supermembrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitude of massless scalars on the world volume of an infinite $D = 11$ supermembrane quantized in the static gauge. The resulting expression is manifestly finite and turns out to be much simpler than in the bosonic membrane case in arXiv:2308.12189 being simply proportional to the tree-level scattering amplitude. We also consider the case of $\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \times S^1$ membrane with one dimension compactified on a circle of radius R and demonstrate how the supermembrane scattering amplitude reduces to the one on an infinite $D = 10$ Green-Schwarz superstring in the limit of R $\rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the general theory of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), we prove that causality implies both the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and, surprisingly, the Strong Energy Condition (SEC). This has implications for gravitational applications, such as regular black holes supported by NLED matter. For self-dual NLED theories, weak-field causality alone implies both the DEC and SEC, as we illustrate with Born-Infeld and ModMax electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing the standardizability of, and deriving cosmological constraints from, a new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst data compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Self-interactions can (also) destabilize bosonic stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical stability of Proca-Higgs stars, in spherical symmetry. These are solutions of the Einstein-Proca-Higgs model, which features a Higgs-like field coupled to a Proca field, both of which minimally coupled to the gravitational field. The corresponding stars can be regarded as Proca stars with self-interactions, while avoiding the hyperbolicity issues of self-interacting Einstein-Proca models. We report that these configurations are stable near the Proca limit in the candidate stable branches, but exhibit instabilities in certain parts of the parameter space, even in the candidate stable branches, regaining their stability for very strong self-interactions. This shows that for these models, unlike various examples of scalar boson stars, self-interactions can deteriorate, rather than improve, the dynamical robustness of bosonic stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the BPS Lagrangian method, we obtain a distinct set of Bogomolny equations for the Cho-Maison monopoles from the bosonic sector of a regularized electroweak theory. In the limit of $n\rightarrow\infty$ of the permittivity regulator, $\epsilon\left(\rho^n\right)$, the mass of the monopole can be estimated to be $M_W\sim3.56$ TeV. This value is within the latest theoretical window, 2.98 TeV - 3.75 TeV. We also discuss some possible regularization mechanisms of electroweak monopole in the Yang-Mills sector and the existence of its BPS state.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on future rip scenarios with holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the charge and heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method within the quasiparticle model. Utilizing a novel collision integral for both the relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) models, we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to estimate the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity. We have investigated the temperature dependence of these transport coefficients. We have also provided a comparison between our findings and those of the standard RTA and BGK models. Further, we have explored the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries have emerged as a tool for developing viable and physically coherent models, particularly in scenarios incorporating a negative cosmological constant. This study demonstrates that when the bulk geometry accommodates a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which operate on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (be they spacelike or timelike), it leads to the existence of two distinct families of five-dimensional spacetimes. These spacetimes represent the general solutions to the bulk field equations. An aspect of these models is the composition of their energy-momentum tensor, which includes two key components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. This framework can be perceived as a $5D$ extension of the recently identified Spatially Inhomogeneous and Irrotational spacetimes. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the Randall-Sundrum theory. This exploration is essential for deepening our understanding of the role of higher dimensions in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Quantum deformed phantom dynamics in light of the generalized uncertainty principle</title>

Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the Unruh-thermalized CERN-NA63 radiation reaction data set from the point of view of a diphoton Rindler bath. Under the assumption that these Hawking-Unruh diphoton pairs are microscopic trans-Planckian black holes, we find the resultant heat capacity describes the measured energy spectrum and is thus a dual description of the data set. Then, employing an n-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann analysis, we find the power radiated by a black hole in the standard 3+1 spacetime dimensions in complete agreement with the data. Finally, we utilize this power spectrum to directly measure Newtons constant of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound of Barrow Entropy Index from Black Hole Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both classical and quantum arguments suggest that if Barrow entropy is correct, its index $\delta$ must be energy dependent, which would affect the very early universe. Based on thermodynamic stability that sufficiently large black holes should not fragment, we argue that Barrow entropy correction must be small except possibly at the Planckian regime. Furthermore, the fact that a solar mass black hole does not fragment implies an upper bound $\delta \lesssim O(10^{-3})$, which surprisingly lies in the same range as the bound obtained from some cosmological considerations assuming fixed $\delta$. This indicates that allowing $\delta$ to run does not raise its allowed value. We briefly comment on the case of Kaniadakis entropy.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of vector Horndeski black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horndeski's vector-tensor (HVT) gravity is described by a Lagrangian in which the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$ of a vector field $A_{\mu}$ interacts with a double dual Riemann tensor $L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ in the form $\beta L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\alpha \beta}$, where $\beta$ is a constant. In Einstein-Maxwell-HVT theory, there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions with electric or magnetic charges, whose metric components are modified from those in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. The electric-magnetic duality of solutions is broken even at the background level by the nonvanishing coupling constant $\beta$. We compute a second-order action of BH perturbations containing both the odd- and even-parity modes and show that there are four dynamical perturbations arising from the gravitational and vector-field sectors. We derive all the linear stability conditions associated with the absence of ghosts and radial/angular Laplacian instabilities for both the electric and magnetic BHs. These conditions exhibit the difference between the electrically and magnetically charged cases by reflecting the breaking of electric-magnetic duality at the level of perturbations. In particular, the four angular propagation speeds in the large-multipole limit are different from each other for both the electric and magnetic BHs. This suggests the breaking of eikonal correspondence between the peak position of at least one of the potentials of dynamical perturbations and the radius of photon sphere. For the electrically and magnetically charged cases, we elucidate parameter spaces of the HVT coupling and the BH charge in which the BHs without naked singularities are linearly stable.</description>

Abstract: We give a generalization of Goncharov's Hodge correlator twistor connection. Our generalized version is a connection 1-form with values in a DG Lie algebra of uni-trivalent graphs which may have loops and satisfies some Maurer--Cartan equation. This connection and the Maurer--Cartan equation can be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of effective action and quantum master equation respectively in non-acyclic Chern--Simons perturbation theory associated with the trivial local system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parametrized black hole quasinormal ringdown formalism, which is a robust framework used to analyze quasinormal modes in systems that closely resemble general relativity, paying particular attention to the higher overtones. We find that larger deviations from the general relativity case typically appear in the quasinormal frequencies for the higher overtones. This growing tendency for higher overtones can be understood using an analytical method, and its relations to previous works are briefly discussed. Our findings indicate that we can impose a strong constraint on gravity theories by considering the overtones of quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>A machine learning-based study of open-charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions, the study of charm hadrons plays a pivotal role in understanding the QCD medium and provides an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interaction, as they are mostly produced in the early stages of collisions via hard partonic interactions. The lightest open-charm, $D^{0}$ meson ($c\bar{u}$), can originate from two separate sources. The prompt $D^{0}$ originates from direct charm production or decay of excited open charm states, and the nonprompt stems from the decay of beauty hadrons. In this paper, using different machine learning (ML) algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, an attempt has been made to segregate the prompt and nonprompt production modes of $D^{0}$ meson signal from its background. The ML models are trained using the invariant mass ($M_{\pi K}$) through its hadronic decay channel, i.e., $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+} K^{-}$, pseudoproper time ($t_{z}$), pseudoproper decay length ($c\tau$), and distance of closest approach of $D^{0}$ meson, using PYTHIA8 simulated $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\rm{TeV}$. The ML models used in this analysis are found to retain the pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and collision energy dependence. In addition, we report the ratio of nonprompt to prompt $D^{0}$ yield, the self-normalized yield of prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$ and explore the charmonium, $J/\psi$ to open-charm, $D^{0}$ yield ratio as a function of transverse momenta and normalized multiplicity. The observables studied in this manuscript are well predicted by all the ML models compared to the simulation.</description>

Abstract: We construct representations of the quantum algebras ~$U_{q{\bf q}}(gl(n))$ and ~$U_{q{\bf q}}(sl(n))$~ which are in duality with the multiparameter quantum groups ~$GL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$, ~$SL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$,~ respectively. These objects depend on ~$n(n-1)/2+1$~ deformation parameters ~$q,q_{ij}$ ($1\leq i &lt;j\leq n$) which is the maximal possible number in the case of $GL(n)$. The representations are labelled by $n-1$ complex numbers ~$r_i$~ and are acting in the space of formal power series of ~$n(n-1)/2$~ non-commuting variables. These variables generate quantum flag manifolds of ~$GL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$, ~$SL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$. The case $n=3$ is treated in more detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the unique features of quantum gravity is the lack of local observables and the completeness of boundary observables. We show that the existence of boundary observables for particles with mass $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{H}=\infty$ in scalar field cosmologies where $a(t)\sim t^{p}$ is equivalent to TCC, which implies $p\leq 1$. Moreover, the mass of weakly-coupled particles must decay like $m\lesssim t^{1-2p}$ to ensure that they yield non-trivial boundary observables. This condition can be expressed in terms of the scalar field that drives the cosmology as $m\lesssim\exp(-c\phi)$ where $c$ depends on the scalar potential. The strongest bound we find is achieved for $V\sim \exp(-2\phi/\sqrt{d-2})$ where $c=1/\sqrt{d-2}$. These results connect some of the most phenomenologically interesting Swampland conjectures to the most basic version of holography.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with two types of Feynman integrals in perturbative quantum field theory: the 2-loop 2-point kite, with 5 arbitrary internal masses, and its completion by a sixth propagator, to give a 3-loop tetrahedral tadpole, with 6 arbitrary masses. These general-mass cases cover broken and unbroken gauge theories, based on the Lie algebras U(1), SU(2) and SU(3), for the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. The elliptic substructure of these integrals should not be regarded as an obstruction. Rather, it is a bonus, thanks to the arithmetic-geometric mean of Gauss. Compact formulae are given, to handle all cases. Zero-mass limits are carefully considered. Anomalous thresholds of triangles in the kite pose no problem. The number theory of tadpoles is investigated, with intriguing results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R7-branes are a class of recently discovered non-supersymmetric real codimension-two duality defects in type IIB string theory predicted by the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture. For type IIB realizations of 6D SCFTs with $\mathcal{N} = (2,0)$ supersymmetry, wrapping an R7-brane "at infinity" leads to a topological operator associated with a zero-form charge conjugation symmetry that squares to the identity. Similar considerations hold for those theories obtained from further toroidal compactification, but this can be obstructed by bundle curvature effects. Using some minimal data on the topological sector of the R7-branes, we extract the associated fusion rules for these charge conjugation operators. More broadly, we sketch a top down realization of various topological operators / interfaces associated with $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{R}$, and $\mathsf{T}$ transformations. We also use holography to provide strong evidence for the existence of the R7-brane which is complementary to the Cobordism Conjecture. Similar considerations apply to other string-realized QFTs with symmetry operators constructed via non-supersymmetric branes which carry a conserved charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian structure of unimodular-like theories, where the cosmological constant (or other supposed constants of nature) are demoted from fixed parameters to classical constants of motion. No new local degrees of freedom are present as a result of a $U(1)$ gauge invariance of the theory. Hamiltonian analysis of the action reveals that the only possible gauge fixing that can be enforced is setting the spatial components of the four-volume time vector ${\cal T}^{i}\approx0$. As a consequence of this, the gauge-fixed unimodular path integral is equivalent to the minisuperspace unimodular path integral. However, should we break the $U(1)$ gauge invariance, two things happen: a massless propagating degree of freedom appears, and the (gauge-invariant) zero-mode receives modified dynamics. The implications are investigated, with the phenomenology depending crucially on the target ``constant''.</description>

Abstract: We propose studying a new representation of on-shell Anti de Sitter (AdS) amplitude in Mellin Momentum space, where it encodes all the dynamical information in Cosmological Correlators. At tree level, we demonstrate that this amplitude has a similar analytic structure as the S-matrix, with residues of poles made up of on-shell lower-point amplitudes. We use this structure to bootstrap 4-point scalar amplitudes with spin-1 and spin-2 exchange. In the second part of the paper, we use double copy to construct the 4-point graviton amplitude in general dimension. This leads us to a novel, concise formula that exhibits the flat space structure. We also verified this formula for the case when d=3 with literature.</description>

      <title>Riemann zeros as quantized energies of scattering with impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an integrable physical model of a single particle scattering with impurities spread on a circle. The $S$-matrices of the scattering with the impurities are such that the quantized energies of this system, coming from the Bethe Ansatz equations, correspond to the imaginary parts of the non-trivial zeros of the the Riemann $\zeta(s) $ function along the axis $\Re ( s )= \half$ of the complex $s$-plane. A simple and natural generalization of the original scattering problem leads instead to Bethe Ansatz equations whose solutions are the non-trivial zeros of the Dirichlet $L$-functions again along the axis $\Re (s) = \half$. The conjecture that all the non-trivial zeros of these functions are aligned along this axis of the complex $s$-plane is known as the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). In the language of the scattering problem analysed in this paper the validity of the GRH is equivalent to the completeness of the Bethe Ansatz equations. Moreover the idea that the validity of the GRH requires both the duality equation (i.e. the mapping $s \rightarrow 1 - s$) and the Euler product representation of the Dirichlet $L$-functions finds additional and novel support from the physical scattering model analysed in this paper. This is further illustrated by an explicit counterexample provided by the solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations which employ the Davenport-Heilbronn function $\CD (s) $, i.e. a function whose completion satisfies the duality equation $\chi(s) = \chi(1-s)$ but that does not have an Euler product representation. In this case, even though there are infinitely many solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations along the axis $\Re (s) = \half$, there are also infinitely many pairs of solutions away from this axis and symmetrically placed with respect to it.</description>

      <title>Scaling symmetry, Smarr relation, and the extended first law in lower-dimensional Lovelock gravity</title>

Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that lower-dimensional versions of Lovelock gravity exist as scalar-tensor theories that are examples of Horndeski gravity. We study the thermodynamics of the static black hole solutions in these theories up to cubic order through Euclidean methods. Considering solutions with spherical, planar and hyperbolic event horizons ($k=+1, 0, -1$), we show that the universality of the thermodynamics for planar black holes ($k=0$) and the extended 1st law that include the variation of the couplings together with their associated potentials hold also in lower dimensions. We find that in $D=4, 6$ where the 2nd- and the 3rd-order Lovelock Lagrangians are boundary terms respectively, the Smarr relation is modified since the entropy is not a homogenous function in these dimensions. We also present a derivation of the Smarr relation and its modified version based on the global scaling properties of the reduced action that is used to obtain the solutions consistently. Unlike the other hairy black hole solutions that have been analyzed before, despite the terms in the reduced action that break the scaling symmetry, the derivation still follows from a conserved Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stress-energy tensor on global anti-de Sitter space-time with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for a massless, conformally coupled scalar field on global anti-de Sitter space-time in four dimensions. Robin (mixed) boundary conditions are applied to the scalar field. We compute both the vacuum and thermal expectation values of the RSET. The vacuum RSET is a multiple of the space-time metric when either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are applied. Imposing Robin boundary conditions breaks the maximal symmetry of the vacuum state and results in an RSET whose components with mixed indices have their maximum (or maximum magnitude) at the space-time origin. The value of this maximum depends on the boundary conditions. We find similar behaviour for thermal states. As the temperature decreases, thermal expectation values of the RSET approach those for vacuum states and their values depend strongly on the boundary conditions. As the temperature increases, the values of the RSET components tend to profiles which are the same for all boundary conditions. We also find, for both vacuum and thermal states, that the RSET on the space-time boundary is independent of the boundary conditions and determined entirely by the trace anomaly.</description>

      <title>S-matrix on effective string and compactified membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding Nambu-Goto action near infinitely long string vacuum one can compute scattering amplitudes of 2d massless fields representing transverse string coordinates. As was shown in arXiv:1203.1054, the resulting S-matrix is integrable, in agreement with the known free string spectrum and also with an interpretation of the static-gauge NG action as a $T\bar T$ deformation of a free massless theory. We consider a generalization of this computation to the case of a membrane, expanding its 3d action near an infinite membrane vacuum that has cylindrical $\mathbb R \times S^1$ shape (we refer to such membrane as "compactified"). Representing 3d fields as Fourier series in $S^1$ coordinate we get an effective 2d model in which the massless string modes are coupled to an infinite KK tower of massive 2d modes. We find that the resulting 2d S-matrix is not integrable already at the tree level. We also compute 1-loop scattering amplitude of massless string modes with all compactified membrane modes propagating in the loop. The result is UV finite and is a non-trivial function of the kinematic variables. In the large momentum limit or when the radius of $S^1$ is taken to infinity we recover the expression for the 1-loop scattering amplitude of the uncompactified $\mathbb R^2$ membrane. We also consider a 2d model which is the $T\bar T$ deformation to the free theory with the same massless plus infinite massive tower of modes. The corresponding 2d S-matrix is found, as expected, to be integrable.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Emergence Proposal in the vector multiplet moduli space of type IIA N=2 supersymmetric string vacua in four dimensions, for which the string tree-level prepotential and the string one-loop correction are exactly known via mirror symmetry. We argue that there exists an exact notion of emergence, according to which these four-dimensional couplings can be computed exactly in any asymptotic limit in field space. In such limits, a perturbative quantum gravity theory emerges, whose fundamental degrees of freedom include all complete infinite towers of states with typical mass scale not larger than the species scale. For a decompactification limit, this picture is closely related to and in fact motivated by the computation of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. In addition, in the same limit our results suggest that the emergent theory will also contain asymptotically tensionless wrapped NS5-branes.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies &amp; bordism of non-supersymmetric strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three tachyon-free non-supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions provide a handle on quantum gravity away from the supersymmetric lamppost. However, they have not been shown to be fully consistent; although local anomalies cancel due to versions of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, there could be global anomalies, not cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism, that could become fatal pathologies. We compute the twisted string bordism groups that control these anomalies via the Adams spectral sequence, showing that they vanish completely in two out of three cases (Sugimoto and $SO(16)^2$) and showing a partial vanishing also in the third (Sagnotti 0'B model). We also compute lower-dimensional bordism groups of the non-supersymmetric string theories, which are of interest to the classification of branes in these theories via the Cobordism Conjecture. We propose a worldvolume content based on anomaly inflow for the $SO(16)^2$ NS5-brane, and discuss subtleties related to the torsion part of the Bianchi identity. As a byproduct of our techniques and analysis, we also reprove that the outer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ automorphism swapping the two $E_8$ factors in the supersymmetric heterotic string is also non-anomalous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersymmetric baby-Skyrme model is an interesting field theoretical model, and its BPS states have been studied using the usual methods. Here, we propose a novel method to rigorously obtain both topologically stable BPS and non-BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ baby Skyrme Model. It is observed that the BPS states found using this novel method coincide with the BPS states found using the usual methods. However, we are also able to obtain the non-BPS states, which break all of the supersymmetry of the theory. Furthermore, there exists a one-parameter family of non-BPS solutions that are connected to the half-BPS solutions, where half of the supersymmetry is restored when the parameter is set to zero. The proposed method is very general, and we expect that it might be useful for investigating the topologically stable non-BPS states of other theories. Thus, this method could possibly have wide applications for the study of non-BPS states in supersymmetric theories.</description>

Abstract: The physics of primordial black holes can be affected by the non-Gaussian statistics of the density fluctuations that generate them. Therefore, it is important to have good theoretical control of the higher-order correlation functions for primordial curvature perturbations. By working at leading order in a $1/|\eta|$ expansion, we analytically determine the bispectrum of curvature fluctuations for single field inflationary scenarios producing primordial black holes. The bispectrum has a rich scale and shape dependence, and its features depend on the dynamics of the would-be decaying mode. We apply our analytical results to study gravitational waves induced at second order by enhanced curvature fluctuations. Their statistical properties are derived in terms of convolution integrals over wide momentum ranges, and they are sensitive on the scale and shape dependence of the curvature bispectrum we analytically computed.</description>

      <title>Cutoff brane vs the Karch-Randall brane: the fluctuating case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, certain holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ is proposed to capture the main features of the AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ correspondence \cite{Basu:2022crn,Basu:2023wmv}. In this paper, by adapting the Weyl transformation, we simulate a generalized AdS/BCFT set-up where the fluctuation of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane is considered. In the gravity dual of the Weyl transformed CFT, the so-called cutoff brane induced by the Weyl transformation plays the same role as the KR brane. Unlike the non-fluctuating configuration, in the $2d$ effective theory the additional twist operator is inserted at a different place, compared with the one inserted on the brane. Though this is well-understood in the Weyl transformed CFT set-up, it is confusing in the AdS/BCFT set-up where the effective theory is supposed to locate on the brane. This confusion indicates that the KR brane may be emergent from the boundary CFT$_2$ via the Weyl transformations.
  We also calculate the balanced partial entanglement (BPE) in the fluctuating brane configurations and find it coincide with the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS). This is a non-trivial test for the correspondence between the BPE and the EWCS, and a non-trivial consistency check for the Weyl transformed CFT set-up.</description>

Abstract: We describe a method for defining dynamical black hole entropy in gravitational effective field theories (EFTs). The entropy is constructed order by order in derivatives. For any fixed number of derivatives, the entropy satisfies a non-perturbative second law of black hole mechanics if the black hole remains within the regime of validity of EFT. In equilibrium the entropy reduces to the Wald entropy. It reduces to the entropy defined by Hollands et al in theories of vacuum gravity with up to 10 derivatives.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a little-studied observable in classical pure AdS3 gravity: the twist along a geodesic. The motivation is that the twist only supports on the geodesic so may be a candidate element in the center of the algebra in either entanglement wedge associated to the geodesic. We study the properties of the twist and get the following results. First, we get the system's evolution generated by the twist, which exhibits a relative shift along the geodesic. Second, we show that the twist commutes with the length of the same geodesic, which supports the proposal that the twist is a candidate element in the center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-parameter families of $U(1)^2$ preserving deformations relating pairs of toric quiver gauge theories on D-branes probing local toric (pseudo) del Pezzo surfaces. The superpotential deformations are defined by zig-zag paths in the brane tiling and are non-trivial in the chiral ring if the geometry has a non-isolated singularity. In the dual $(p,q)$ web, the deformation is realized as a Hanany-Witten move that reverses a semi-infinite fivebrane. We use these deformations to find RG flows between 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs on D3-branes probing local toric (pseudo) del Pezzo surfaces of the same degree, and briefly comment on the interpretation for BPS quivers of rank one 5d SCFTs on $S^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop effective action of the Horava theory, in its nonprojectable formulation. We take the quantization of the (2+1)-dimensional theory in the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism, and comment on the extension to the (3+1) case. The second-class constraints and the appropriate gauge-fixing condition are included in the quantization. The ghost fields associated with the second-class constraints can be used to get the integrated form of the effective action, which has the form of a Berezinian. We show that all irregular loops cancel between them in the effective action. The key for the cancellation is the role of the ghosts associated with the second-class constraints. These ghosts form irregular loops that enter in the denominator of the Berezinian, eliminating the irregular loops of the bosonic nonghost sector. Irregular loops produce dangerous divergences; hence their cancellation is an essential step for the consistency of the theory. The cancellation of this kind of divergences is in agreement with the previous analysis done on the (2+1) quantum canonical Lagrangian and its Feynman diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We show that the bosonic sector of the $N=(1,0),\, 6D$ Salam-Sezgin gauged supergravity model possesses a $T$-duality symmetry upon a circle reduction to $D=5$. We then construct a simple magnetic rotating string solution with two equal angular momenta. Applying the $T$-duality transformation to this solution, we obtain the general boosted rotating dyonic black string solutions whose global structures and thermodynamic quantities are also analyzed. Owing to the fact that the solutions are not asymptotically flat, we find that there are two distinct globally-different non-extremal solutions with two different sets of thermal dynamic variables, with both satisfying the thermodynamic first law and the corresponding Small relations. However, their BPS limit becomes the same and we show that it preserves one quarter of supersymmetry by directly solving the corresponding Killing spinor equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that by using a Lagrange multiplier field to ensure that the classical equations of motion are satisfied, radiative effects beyond one-loop order are eliminated. It has also been shown that through the contribution of some additional ghost fields, the effective action becomes form invariant under a redefinition of field variables, and furthermore, the usual one-loop results coincide with the quantum corrections obtained from this effective action. In this paper, we consider the consequences of a gauge invariance being present in the classical action. The resulting gauge transformations for the Lagrange multiplier field as well as for the additional ghost fields are found. These gauge transformations result in a set of Faddeev-Popov ghost fields arising in the effective action. If the gauge algebra is closed, we find the Becci-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) transformations that leave the effective action invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional formulation of QED since the 50s works very well for stationary states and for scattering problems, but with newly arisen challenges from the 80s on, where real time evolution of particles in a nonequilibrium setting are required, and quantum features such as coherence, dissipation, correlation and entanglement in a system interacting with its quantum field environment are sought after, new ways to formulate QED suitable for these purposes beckon. In this paper we present a linearized effective theory using a Gaussian wavepacket description of a charged relativistic particle coupled to quantum electromagnetic fields to study the interplay between single electrons and quantum fields in free space, at a scale well below the Schwinger limit. The proper values of the regulators in our effective theory are determined from the data of individual experiments, and will be time-dependent in the laboratory frame if the single electrons are accelerated. Using this new theoretical tool, we address the issues of decoherence of flying electrons in free space and the impact of Unruh effect on the electrons. Our result suggests that vacuum fluctuations may be a major source of blurring the interference pattern in electron microscopes. For a single electron accelerated in a uniform electric field, we identify the Unruh effect in the two-point correlators of the deviations from the electron's classical trajectory. From our calculations we also bring out some subtleties, involving the bosonic versus fermionic spectral functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description for an SYK model, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extradimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections given by the Schwarzian action when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extradimension, we observe that the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients RG-flow along the extradimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. To confirm this insulating physics, we investigate thermodynamics. We obtain an effective free energy functional in terms of such bi-local dual order-parameter fields, which satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the holographic dual effective field theory. ...</description>

Abstract: In this paper we analytically explore the modularity of the flavored Schur index of 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFTs. We focus on the $A_1$ theories of class-$\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{N} = 4$ theories with $SU(N)$ gauge group. We work out the modular orbit of the flavored index and defect index, compute the dimension of the space spanned by the orbit, and provide complete basis for computing modular transformation matrices. The dimension obtained from the flavored analysis predicts the minimal order of the unflavored modular differential equation satisfied by the unflavored Schur index. With the help of modularity, we also study analytically the high-temperature asymptotics of the Schur index. In the high-temperature limit $\tau \to +i0$, we identified the (defect) Schur index of the genus-zero $A_1$ theories of class-$\mathcal{S}$ with the $S^3$-partition function of the $SU(2) \times U(1)^n$ star-shape quiver (with Wilson line insertion). In the identification, we observe an interesting relation between the linear-independence of defect indices and the convergence of the Wilson line partition functions.</description>

      <title>Wall-Crossing Effects on Quiver BPS Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The well-known wall-crossing phenomena are that the fixed point spectrum establishes a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space into a collection of stability chambers -- ``phases'' of the theory. The standard construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases (chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them glasses and also divide in a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as new wall-crossing invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Schwinger model of a massless charged fermion coupled to an Abelian gauge field on a fixed de Sitter background. The theory admits an exact solution, first examined by Jayewardena, and can be analyzed efficiently using Euclidean methods. We calculate fully non-perturbative, gauge-invariant correlation functions of the electric field as well as the fermion and analyze these correlators in the late-time limit. We compare these results with the perturbative picture, for example by verifying the one-loop contribution to the fermion two-point function, as predicted from the exact solution, matches the direct computation of the one-loop Feynman diagram. We demonstrate many features endemic of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, including the appearance of late-time logarithms, their resummation to de Sitter invariant expressions, and Boltzmann suppressed non-perturbative phenomena, with surprising late-time features.</description>

Abstract: We introduce hydrodynamics derived from the action of a perfect fluid deformed by the Novikov multivalued functional generated by combined actions of gauge transformations and spacetime diffeomorphisms. This deformation is structured analogously to the Wess-Zumino functional, commonly used as an effective description of field theories with the chiral anomaly. The deformation affects the continuity equation giving fluid spin degrees of freedom and is consistent with the kinematics of the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic of holography between anti-de Sitter space holography and de Sitter holography is a very fascinating comparison, which provides many key insights into what we expect from holography in general. In this Essay, we highlight this dynamic with three examples: first, when taking Wheeler-DeWitt states to the asymptotic boundary, the dual interpretation is unclear in de Sitter. Second, what we make of bulk reconstruction and subregion duality in AdS/CFT is not trivially reflected in the dS/CFT scenario. Third, a way of formulating emergence and subregion-subalgebra duality in de Sitter space does not yet exist. With these examples, we provide some musings on this canvas of holography in the settings of (A)dS/CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate the anthropic prediction of the dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Massless limit and conformal soft limit for celestial massive amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In celestial holography, the massive and massless scalars in 4d space-time are represented by the Fourier transform of the bulk-to-boundary propagators and the Mellin transform of plane waves respectively. Recently, the 3pt celestial amplitude of one massive scalar and two massless scalars was discussed in arXiv:2312.08597. In this paper, we compute the 3pt celestial amplitude of two massive scalars and one massless scalar. Then we take the massless limit $m\to 0$ for one of the massive scalars, during which process the gamma function $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ appears. By requiring the resulting amplitude to be well-defined, that is it goes to the 3pt amplitude of arXiv:2312.08597, the scaling dimension of this massive scalar has to be conformally soft $\Delta \to 1$. The pole $1/(1-\Delta)$ coming from $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ is crucial for this massless limit. Without it the resulting amplitude would be zero. This can be compared with the conformal soft limit in celestial gluon amplitudes, where a singularity $1/(\Delta -1)$ arises and the leading contribution comes from the soft energy $\omega\to 0$. The phase factors in the massless limit of massive conformal primary wave functions, dicussed in arXiv:1705.01027, plays an import and consistent role in the celestial massive amplitudes. In this massless limit, the subleading terms $m^{2n}$ can also contribute poles when the scaling dimension is analytically continued to $\Delta=1-n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of renormalization group flows on line defects that can be described by a generalized free field with ordered planar contractions on the line. They are realized, for example, in large $N$ gauge theories with matter in the fundamental representation and arise generically in non-relativistic CFTs. We analyze the flow exactly and compute the change in the $g$-function between the UV and IR fixed points. We relate the result to the change in the two-point function of the displacement operator and check the monotonicity of the defect entropy along the flow analytically. Finally, we give a general realization of this type of flow starting from the direct sum of the IR fixed point and a trivial line. This type of defect renormalization group flow parallels the well-studied case of double-trace flow.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05618v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to make a connection between tropical geometry, representations of quantum affine algebras, and scattering amplitudes in physics. The connection allows us to study important and difficult questions in these areas:
  (1) We give a systematic construction of prime modules (including prime non-real modules) of quantum affine algebras using tropical geometry. We also introduce new objects which generalize positive tropical Grassmannians.
  (2) We propose a generalization of Grassmannian string integrals in physics, in which the integrand is no longer a finite, but rather an infinite product indexed by prime modules of a quantum affine algebra. We give a general formula of $u$-variables using prime tableaux (corresponding to prime modules of quantum affine algebras of type $A$) and Auslander-Reiten quivers of Grassmannian cluster categories.
  (3) We study limit $g$-vectors of cluster algebras. This is another way to obtain prime non-real modules of quantum affine algebras systematically. Using limit $g$-vectors, we construct new examples of non-real modules of quantum affine algebras.</description>

Abstract: We use Boltzmann model to study the semi-classical dynamics of electrons in a two-dimensional (2D) tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. As the first manifestation of graivto-electric phenomena, we find a geometric planar Hall effect according to which a current flows in a direction transverse to the chemical potential gradient and is proportional to component $g^{xy}$ of the emergent spacetime structure. The longitudinal conductivity contains information about the gravitational red-shift factors. Furthermore, in the absence of externally applied electric field there can be "free-fall" or zero-bias currents that can be used as detectors of terahertz radiation.</description>

      <title>Vortex Effects in Merging Black Holes and Saturons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vorticity has recently been suggested to be a property of highly-spinning black holes. The connection between vorticity and limiting spin represents a universal feature shared by objects of maximal microstate entropy, so-called saturons. Using $Q$-ball-like saturons as a laboratory for black holes, we study the collision of two such objects and find that vorticity can have a large impact on the emitted radiation as well as on the charge and angular momentum of the final configuration. As black holes belong to the class of saturons, we expect that the formation of vortices can cause similar effects in black hole mergers, leading to macroscopic deviations in gravitational radiation. This could leave unique signatures detectable with upcoming gravitational-wave searches, which can thereby serve as a portal to macroscopic quantum effects in black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze (using a chiral effective Lagrangian model) the scalar and pseudoscalar meson mass spectrum of QCD at finite temperature, above the chiral transition at $T_c$, in the realistic case with $N_f = 2 + 1$ light quark flavors (that is, with $m_{u,d} \to 0$ and $m_s \neq 0$), looking, in particular, for signatures of the breaking of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry above $T_c$. A critical comparison with the corresponding results obtained (in a previous study) in the two limit cases $N_f = 2$ and $N_f = 3$ and with the available lattice results is performed, together with a discussion on the limits of validity of a description in terms of a chiral effective Lagrangian model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation is a highly favoured theory for the early Universe. It is compatible with current observations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure and is a driver in the quest to detect primordial gravitational waves. It is also, given the current quality of the data, highly under-determined with a large number of candidate implementations. We use a new method in symbolic regression to generate all possible simple scalar field potentials for one of two possible basis sets of operators. Treating these as single-field, slow-roll inflationary models we then score them with an information-theoretic metric ("minimum description length") that quantifies their efficiency in compressing the information in current data. We explore two possible priors on the parameter space of potentials, one related to the functions' structural complexity and one that uses a Katz back-off language model to prefer functions that may be theoretically motivated. This enables us to identify the inflaton potentials that optimally balance simplicity with accuracy at explaining current data, which may subsequently find theoretical motivation. Our exploratory study opens the door to extraction of fundamental physics directly from data, and may be augmented with more refined theoretical priors in the quest for a complete understanding of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and anomalies of Kitaev spin-$S$ models: Identifying symmetry-enforced exotic quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the internal symmetries and their anomalies in the Kitaev spin-$S$ models. Importantly, these models have a lattice version of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$. There is also an ordinary 0-form $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}$ are $\pi$ spin rotations around two orthogonal axes, and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ is the time reversal symmetry. The anomalies associated with the full $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$ symmetry are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{17}$. We find that for $S\in\mathbb{Z}$ the model is anomaly-free, while for $S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$ there is an anomaly purely associated with the 1-form symmetry, but there is no anomaly purely associated with the ordinary symmetry or mixed anomaly between the 0-form and 1-form symmetries. The consequences of these symmetries and anomalies apply to not only the Kitaev spin-$S$ models, but also any of their perturbed versions, assuming that the perturbations are local and respect the symmetries. If these local perturbations are weak, generically these consequences still apply even if the perturbations break the 1-form symmetry. A notable consequence is that there should generically be a deconfined fermionic excitation carrying no fractional quantum number under the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry if $S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$, which implies symmetry-enforced exotic quantum matter. We also discuss the consequences for $S\in\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

Abstract: I discuss the thermodynamics-based derivation of the formula for the entanglement entropy of a system of gluons. The derivation is based on an approach where saturation and the Unruh effect were used to obtain and discuss the entropy of gluons. The formula agrees, in the high-energy limit, up to a numerical factor, with more recent results, where arguments based on the density matrix and bipartition of the proton were used to obtain the formula. I also discuss the relation of entropy as obtained in BFKL in DLL approximation and with the application of the BK equation.</description>

      <title>Can we distinguish black holes with electric and magnetic charges from quasinormal modes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) with electric and magnetic charges. For the electrically charged case, the dynamics of perturbations separates into the odd- and even-parity sectors with two coupled differential equations in each sector. In the presence of both electric and magnetic charges, the differential equations of four dynamical degrees of freedom are coupled with each other between odd- and even-parity perturbations. Despite this notable modification, we show that, for a given total charge and mass, a BH with mixed electric and magnetic charges gives rise to the same quasinormal frequencies for fundamental modes. This includes the case in which two BHs have equal electric and magnetic charges for each of them. Thus, the gravitational-wave observations of quasinormal modes during the ringdown phase alone do not distinguish between electrically and magnetically charged BHs.</description>

      <title>Moving frame theory of zero-bias photocurrent on the surface of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by observations of zero-biased photocurrent on the surface of topological insulators, we show that the in-plane effective magnetic field $\tilde B$ implements a moving frame transformation on the topological insulators' helical surface states. As a result, photo-excited electrons on the surface undergo a Galilean boost proportional to the effective in-plane magnetic field $\tilde B$. The boost velocity is transversely proportional to $\tilde B$. This explains why the experimentally observed photocurrent depends linearly on $\tilde B$. Our theory while consistent with the observation that at leading order the effect does not depend on the polarization of the incident radiation, at next leading order in $\tilde B$ predicts a polarization dependence in both parallel and transverse directions to the polarization. We also predict two induced Fermi surface effects that can serve as further confirmation of our moving frame theory. Based on the estimated value $\zeta\approx 0.34$ of the tilt parameter for a magnetic fields of $\tilde B\sim 3$T, our geometric picture qualifies the surface Dirac cone of magnetic topological insulators as an accessible platform for the synthesis and experimental investigation of strong synthetic gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy dibaryons as seen by string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the stringy description of the system consisting of two heavy and four light quarks in the case of two light flavors of equal mass. As an application, we consider the three low-lying Born-Oppenheimer potentials as a function of the heavy quark separation. Our analysis shows that the ground state potential is described in terms of both hadro-quarkonia and hadronic molecules. A connected string configuration makes the dominant contribution to the potential of an excited state at small separations, and for separations larger than $0.1\,\text{fm}$, it exhibits the diquark-diquark-diquark structure $[Qq][Qq][qq]$. For better understanding the quark organization inside the system, we introduce several critical separations related to the processes of string reconnection, breaking and junction annihilation. We also discuss the simplest string configurations including the five-string junctions and their implications for the system, in particular the emergence of composite quark objects different from diquarks and the process of junction fusion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Degradation in Causal Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement degradation appears to be a generic prediction in relativistic quantum information whenever horizons restrict access to a region of spacetime. This property has been previously explored in connection with the Unruh effect, where a bipartite entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a uniformly accelerated observer (Rob) was studied, with entanglement degradation caused by the relative acceleration -- and with equivalent results for the case when Alice is freely falling into a black hole and Rob experiences a constant proper acceleration as a stationary near-horizon observer. In this work, we show that a similar degradation also occurs in the case of an entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a "diamond observer" (Dave) with a finite lifetime. The condition of a finite lifetime is equivalent to the restriction of Dave's access within a causal diamond. Specifically, if the system starts in a maximally entangled state, prepared from Alice's perspective, entanglement degradation is enforced by the presence of the diamond's causal horizons.</description>

      <title>Infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections: Quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of D-dimensional regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bueno, Cano, and Hennigar [arXiv: 2403.04827] proposed a generic approach for incorporating an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections into the Einstein theory. In this study, we compute quasinormal modes for certain regular D-dimensional black holes resulting from this infinite series of higher curvature corrections, specifically focusing on the D-dimensional extensions of the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode is minimally affected by moderate coupling constants, the higher overtones exhibit significant sensitivity even to small coupling values, yielding unconventional modes characterized by vanishing real oscillation frequencies. When comparing the frequencies derived from the metric truncated at several orders of higher curvature corrections with those resulting from the infinite series of terms, we observe a rapid convergence of the frequencies to their limit for the complete regular black hole. This validates the extensive research conducted on specific theories with a finite number of higher curvature corrections, such as the Lovelock theory.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Virtual Structure Constants and Generalizations of BCOV-Zinger Formula to Projective Fano Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>
