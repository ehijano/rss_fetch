      <title>No Free Lunch for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As sample sizes grow, scalability has become a central concern in the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. One general approach to this problem, exemplified by the popular stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) algorithm, is to use a small random subsample of the data at every time step. This paper, building on recent work such as \cite{nagapetyan2017true,JohndrowJamesE2020NFLf}, shows that this approach often fails: while decreasing the sample size increases the speed of each MCMC step, for typical datasets this is balanced by a matching decrease in accuracy. This result complements recent work such as \cite{nagapetyan2017true} (which came to the same conclusion, but analyzed only specific upper bounds on errors rather than actual errors) and \cite{JohndrowJamesE2020NFLf} (which did not analyze nonreversible algorithms and allowed for logarithmic improvements).</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Potential of Random Equations with Mixture Models: Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20152v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the general modeling and practical simulation of random equations with mixture model parameter random variables. Random equations, understood as stationary (non-dynamical) equations with parameters as random variables, have a long history and a broad range of applications. The specific novelty of this explorative study lies on the demonstration of the combinatorial complexity of these equations and their solutions with mixture model parameters. In a Bayesian argumentation framework, we derive a likelihood function and posterior density of approximate solutions while avoiding significant restrictions about the type of nonlinearity of the equation or mixture models, and demonstrate their numerically efficient implementation for the applied researcher. In the results section, we are specifically focusing on expressive example simulations showcasing the combinatorial potential of random linear equation systems and nonlinear systems of random conic section equations. Introductory applications to portfolio optimization, stochastic control and random matrix theory are provided in order to show the wide applicability of the presented methodology.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Impacts Single-Molecule FRET Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first principle physics and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume. Our models provide the most up-to-date and accurate estimation of FRET.</description>
