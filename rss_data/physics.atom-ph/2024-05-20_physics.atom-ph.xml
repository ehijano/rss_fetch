      <title>Vacuum polarization in molecules II: higher order corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a general formalism for treating vacuum polarization phenomena within an effective field expansion. The coupling between source charges and virtual fields is examined from the perspectives of electrostatic potentials, induced charge densities and form factors in momentum space. A strategy for the efficient calculation of vacuum polarization potentials is outlined, implemented, and applied towards the construction of fitting potentials that are suitable for molecular electronic structure calculations, which enclose no overall charge by construction. The order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$, $\alpha (Z \alpha)^{3}$ and $\alpha^{2}(Z\alpha)$ effects of a Gaussian nuclear charge on the electron-positron field are applied variationally towards the E119F molecule, as well as the order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$ effects arising from the virtual muon and charged pion fields.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in molecules I: Uehling interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to electronic structure are characterized by perturbative expansions in $\alpha$ and $Z\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant and $Z$ is the nuclear charge. A formulation of the leading-order $\alpha(Z\alpha)$ Uehling contribution to the renormalized vacuum polarization is reported in a form that is convenient for implementation in computational studies of the relativistic electronic structures of molecules. Benchmark calculations based on these methods are reported that include the leading-order vacuum polarization effects within relativistic mean-field methods for the E119$^+$ ion and the closed-shell diatomic species E119F.</description>

      <title>Highly charged ions of heavy actinides as sensitive probes for time variation of the fine structure constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly charged ions of heavy actinides from uranium to einsteinium are studied theoretically to find optical transitions sensitive to the variation of the fine structure constant. A number of promising transitions have been found in ions with ionisation degree $\sim$~10. All these transitions correspond in single-electron approximation to the $6p$ - $5f$ transitions. Many of the transitions are between ground and excited metastable states of the ions which means that they can probably be used as optical clock transitions. Some of the ions have more than one clock transition with different sensitivity to the variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. The most promising systems include the Np$^{10+}$, Np$^{9+}$, Pu$^{11+}$, Pu$^{10+}$, Pu$^{9+}$, Pu$^{8+}$, Bk$^{15+}$, Cm$^{12+}$, and Es$^{15+}$ ions.</description>

      <title>Laser Offset Stabilization with Chip-Scale Atomic Diffractive Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise and adjustable control over laser frequency is an essential requirement in numerous applications such as precision spectroscopy, quantum control, and sensing. In many such applications it is desired to stabilize a laser with a variable detuning from an atomic line. In this study, we employ an offset-stabilization scheme by utilizing phase contrast spectroscopy in microfabricated atomic diffractive elements vapor-cells. The spectroscopic response of such a device generates oscillating optical fringes, providing multiple optical frequency stabilization points across a bandwidth of tens of gigahertz, centered around the absorption resonances of Rb. Using this device, we demonstrate laser stabilization at various offset frequencies with instabilities reaching sub-megahertz levels. We further explore the fundamental limitations of our hybrid atomic-photonic device, drawing parallels to birefringent and dichroic spectroscopy apparatuses, which are commonly employed for offset stabilization. Our system showcases a broad offset lock bandwidth, a highly compact footprint, scalability to chip-scale production, and the ability to operate without reliance on magnetic fields. These attributes pave the way for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Finite nuclear mass correction to the hyperfine splitting in hydrogenic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general quantum electrodynamic method for derivation of nuclear recoil corrections in hydrogenic systems, which are exact in the nuclear charge parameter $Z\,\alpha$, is introduced. The exemplary derivation is presented for the $O(m/M)$ nuclear pure recoil correction to the hyperfine splitting. The obtained result is verified by comparison to the known $(Z\,\alpha)^5$ contribution</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent and measurement feedback control based on atoms coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that quantum feedback control may be applied to generate desired states for atomic and photonic systems based on a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this set-up, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, which can be reflected by the terminal mirror or other atoms to establish different feedback loops via the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Thus, in the open system atom-waveguide interactions, measurement-based feedback can modulate the final steady quantum state, while simultaneously, the homodyne detection noise in the measurement process can induce oscillations, which is treated by the coherent feedback designs.</description>

      <title>Conversion of twistedness from light to atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple model and propose a scheme that allows the production of twisted atoms in free space using the absorption of twisted photons by a bound electron. We show that in the inelastic collision of a photon and an atom, the twisted state of the photon is transferred to the center-of-mass state, so that the projection of the orbital momentum of the atom becomes $m_\gamma-\Delta m_e$. We also show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the twistedness of the photon is either transferred to the atomic center-of-mass quantum state or modifies the selection rule for the bound electron transition. Proposed scheme is general and enables complex shaping of the atomic wavefront.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Enhanced Superradiance of a Ryderg-Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the superradiant phase transition of an array of Rydberg atoms in a dissipative microwave cavity. Under the interplay of the cavity field and the long-range Rydberg interaction, the steady state of the system exhibits an interaction-enhanced superradiance, with vanishing critical atom-cavity coupling rates at a discrete set of interaction strengths. We find that, while the phenomenon can be analytically understood in the case of a constant all-to-all interaction, the enhanced superradiance persists under typical experimental parameters with spatially dependent interactions, but at modified critical interaction strengths. The diverging susceptibility at these critical points is captured by emergent quantum Rabi models, each of which comprises a pair of collective atomic states with different numbers of atomic excitations. These collective states become degenerate at the critical interaction strengths, resulting in a superradiant phase for an arbitrarily small atom-cavity coupling.</description>
