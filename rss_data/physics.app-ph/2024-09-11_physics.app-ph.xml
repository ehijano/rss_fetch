      <title>On the negative capacitance in ferroelectric heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative capacitance can be used to overcome the lower limit of subthreshold swing (SS) in field effect transistors (FETs), enabling ultralow-power microelectronics, though the concept of ferroelectric negative capacitance remains contentious. In this work, we analyze the negative capacitance in ferroelectric/dielectric heterostructure rigorously using Landau-Denvonshire theory, identifying three (one) critical dielectric thicknesses for first (second) order ferroelectric phase transition upon which the stability of negative capacitance changes. A critical electric window is also identified, beyond which the ferroelectric negative capacitance cannot be maintained. Between the first and second critical thicknesses, meta-stable negative capacitance exists near zero polarization, yet it will be lost and cannot be recovered when the electric window is broken. Between the second and third critical thicknesses, stable negative capacitance always exists near zero polarization within the electric window regardless of initial polar state, resulting in hysteretic double P-E loop. Beyond the third (first) critical thickness of first (second) order phase transition, P-E loop becomes hysteresis free, though the spontaneous polarization can still be induced at sufficient large electric field. Singularities in the effective dielectric constant is also observed at the critical thickness or electric field. The analysis demonstrates that the negative capacitance of ferroelectric can be stabilized by linear dielectric within a critical electric window, and the negative capacitance can be either hysteresis free or hysteretic for first order ferroelectrics, while it is always hysteresis free for the second order ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Mimicking synaptic plasticity with wedged Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit torque device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fabricated a wedge-shaped Pt/Co/Pt device with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and manifested that the Co magnetization can be solely switched by spin-orbit torque without any magnetic field. Similar to the synaptic weight, we observed that the state of Co magnetization (presented by the anomalous Hall resistance RH) of the wedged Pt/Co/Pt device can be tuned continuously with a large number of nonvolatile levels by applied pulse currents. Furthermore, we studied the synaptic plasticity of the wedged Pt/Co/Pt device, including the excitatory postsynaptic potentials or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and spiking-time-dependent plasticity. The work elucidates the promise of the wedged Pt/Co/Pt device as a candidate for a new type of artificial synaptic device that is induced by a spin current and paves a substantial pathway toward the combination of spintronics and synaptic devices.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Embedded Element Patterns of Reactively Loaded Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for synthesizing reactively loaded antennas and antenna arrays. The framework comprises two main components: computing the fundamental bound using the semi-definite relaxation and finding a realizable solution via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.</description>

      <title>First Principles Investigation of Gas Adsorption on Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Sensing Toxic Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides have shown great promise in the field of gas sensing due to their high catalytic activity and unique electronic properties. They can effectively interact with various gas molecules, making them suitable materials for high performance gas sensors. In this work, we have studied the sensing properties of nitrogen containing gases on different heterostructures using density functional studies. The result shows that NH3 and NOx exhibit weak electronic interactions with MoS/WTe and MoTe/WS heterostructures and strong electronic interactions are observed between NH3 and NOx molecules with MoS/IrO and MoS/TiO heterostructures.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Geminate Pairs in Lead Halide Perovskite revealed via Time-resolved Photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) under continuous illumination is commonly employed to assess voltage losses in solar energy conversion materials. However, the early temporal evolution of these losses remains poorly understood. Therefore, we extend the methodology to time-resolved PL, introducing the concepts of geminate PL, doping PL, and sibling PL to quantify the transient chemical potential of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and key optoelectronic properties. Analyzing the initial PL amplitudes reveals hot charge carrier separation for around 100 nm and is likely limited by the grain size of the triple cation perovskite. The following PL decay is caused by the diffusive separation of non-excitonic geminate pairs and time-resolves a fundamental yet often overlooked energy loss by increasing entropy. For triple-cation halide perovskite, we measure a "geminate correlation energy" of up to 90 meV, persisting for ~ten nanoseconds. This energy is unutilized in standard solar cells and is considered lost in the Shockley-Queisser model. Therefore, this geminate energy could substantially enhance the device's efficiency, particularly under maximum power point and low-illumination conditions.</description>

      <title>LaB6 aided spontaneous conversion of bulk graphite into carbon nanotubes at normal atmospheric conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herein, we report a case study in which we saw the spontaneous conversion of commercial bulk graphite into LaB6 decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under normal atmospheric conditions. The feedstock graphite was used as a hollow cylindrical anode filled with LaB6 powder and partially eroded in a DC electric-arc plasma reactor in pure nitrogen atmosphere. An unusual and spontaneous deformation of the plasma-treated residual anode into a fluffy powder was seen to continue for months when left to ambient atmospheric conditions. The existence of LaB6 decorated multi-walled CNTs at large quantity was confirmed in the as-generated powder by using electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. The as-synthesized CNT-based large-area field emitter showed promising field-emitting properties with a low turn-on electric field of ~1.5 V per micrometer, and a current density of ~1.17 mA per square cm at an applied electric field of 3.24 V per micrometer.</description>

      <title>Role of Zr in Cu-rich single-phase and nanocomposite Cu-Zr: molecular dynamics and experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium atom-by-atom growth of Cu-rich Cu-Zr thin films has been investigated by a combination of magnetron sputter deposition and molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on the role of Zr in the transition from large solid solution crystals through a nanocomposite (around ~5 at.% Zr) to a metallic glass. We find, contrary to the assumption based on equilibrium phase diagram, that in this nonequilibrium case most of the grain refinement and most of the hardness enhancement (from 2.5-3 to 4-5 GPa) takes place in the compositional range (up to ~3 at.% Zr) where many or even most Zr atoms (depending on the sputtering regime) are in the supersaturated solid solution rather than at the grain boundaries. The results are important for the design and understanding of technologically important nanostructured metallic films. In parallel, from the methodology point of view, the results include an early example of modelling the atom-by-atom nanocomposite growth.</description>

Abstract: The deluge of sensors and data generating devices has driven a paradigm shift in modern computing from arithmetic-logic centric to data-centric processing. Data-centric processing require innovations at device level to enable novel compute-in-memory (CIM) operations. A key challenge in construction of CIM architectures is the conflicting trade-off between the performance and their flexibility for various essential data operations. Here, we present a transistor-free CIM architecture that permits storage, search and neural network operations on sub-50nm thick Aluminum Scandium Nitride ferroelectric diodes (FeDs). Our circuit designs and devices can be directly integrated on top of Silicon microprocessors in a scalable process. By leveraging the field-programmability, non-volatility and non-linearity of FeDs, search operations are demonstrated with a cell footprint &lt; 0.12 um2 when projected onto 45-nm node technology. We further demonstrate neural network operations with 4-bit operation using FeDs. Our results highlight FeDs as candidates for efficient and multifunctional CIM platforms.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic swelling of tough hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are biphasic, swollen polymer networks where elastic deformation is coupled to nanoscale fluid flow. As a consequence, hydrogels can withstand large strains and exhibit nonlinear, hyperelastic properties. For low-modulus hydrogel and semiflexible biopolymer networks, previous studies have shown that these materials universally contract when sheared on timescales much longer than the poroelastic relaxation timescale. Using rheological and tribological measurements, we find that stiff polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid hydrogels, with moduli of order ~10-100 kPa, exclusively swell (dilate) when sheared. The poroelastic relaxation process was examined using strain-controlled compression, indicating a volumetric diffusion constant of order 10^-9 m^2/s. Upon shearing, we observed an increase in normal stress that varied quadratically with shear strain, and persisted for hours. Moreover, we show that this dilatant behavior manifests as swelling during tribological sliding, imbibing the hydrogel with fluid. We suggest that this inherent, hyperelastic dilatancy is an important feature in all stiff hydrogels, and may explain rehydration and mechanical rejuvenation in biological tissues such as cartilage.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent fracture in elastomers: experiments and continuum modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastomeric materials display a complicated set of stretchability and fracture properties that strongly depend on the flaw size, which has long been of interest to engineers and materials scientists. Here, we combine experiments and numerical simulations for a comprehensive understanding of the nonlocal, size-dependent features of fracture in elastomers. We show the size-dependent fracture behavior is quantitatively described through a nonlocal continuum model. The key ingredient of the nonlocal model is the use of an intrinsic length scale associated with a finite fracture process zone, which is inferred from experiments. Of particular importance, our experimental and theoretical approach passes the critical set of capturing key aspects of the size-dependent fracture in elastomers. Applications to a wide range of synthetic elastomers that exhibit moderate (~100%) to extreme stretchability (~1000%) are presented, which is also used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in elastomeric specimens with complex geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>
