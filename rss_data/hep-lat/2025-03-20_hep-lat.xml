      <title>Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Lattice gradient flows (de-)stabilizing topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological charge under gradient flow taking the admissibility condition into account. For the $SU(2)$ Wilson gauge theory with $\beta=2.45$ and $L^4=12^4$, we numerically show that the gradient flows with the Iwasaki and DBW2 gauge actions stabilize the topological sectors significantly, and they have qualitatively different behaviors compared with the Wilson and tree-level Symanzik flows. By considering the classical continuum limit of the flow actions, we discuss that the coefficient of dimension-$6$ operators has to be positive for stabilizing the one-instanton configuration, and the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions satisfy this criterion while the Wilson and Symanzik actions do not. Moreover, we observe that the DBW2 flow stabilizes the topological sectors at the very early stage of the flow ($\hat{t}\approx 0.5$--$1$), suggesting that a further systematic investigation of the DBW2 flow is warranted to confirm its computational efficiency in determining the gauge topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equation of state of three-dimensional compact U(1) gauge theory on the lattice by means of numerical simulations, and discuss the implications of our results for the spectrum of the theory, in connection with previous results from the literature. We also compare our findings to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories and comment on the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Entanglement R\'{e}nyi Negativity of Interacting Fermions from Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We calculate the rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity for the spinless $t$-$V$ model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang-Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang-Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang-Mills fields is defined. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, stabilise the chromo-magnetic vortices and dynamically induce, as non-trivial topological features, chiral symmetry-breaking. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation can be derived that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant and yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the peak of the sound velocity for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a system composed of strongly interacting matter with an isospin imbalance, using as an effective description of QCD the two-flavor Linear Sigma Model with quarks. From the one-loop effective potential, including the two light quarks, pions and sigma contributions, and enforcing the restrictions imposed by chiral symmetry, we show that the development of an isospin condensate comes together with the emergence of a Goldstone mode that provides a constraint for the chiral and isospin condensates as a result of a non-trivial mixing between the charged pions and the sigma. We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the peak of the sound velocity to the proper treatment of the Goldstone mode and to the non-trivial mixing of the charged pions and sigma in the isospin condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical catalysis constrained by LQCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidences of vortical effects have been recently found by experiments in heavy ion collisions, instigating new insights into the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Considering the effect of rotations, lattice QCD data shows that the temperatures for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration should increase with real angular velocity, and the dominant effects are related to gluonic degrees of freedom. These findings could be essential for quark models in rotating systems that lack gluonic interactions, which predicts the decreasing of the chiral temperature transition with the angular velocity. To address this issue properly, in this work we apply the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to explore the phase diagram in a rotating rigid cylinder with constant angular velocity in the mean field approximation. To circumvent the absence of gluons, we propose the application of an effective coupling dependent of the angular velocity, fitted to match the pseudocritical temperature of chiral phase transition in the model through lattice QCD data. Our results indicate that the running coupling induces the enhancement of the chiral condensate as a function of angular velocity, strengthening the breaking of chiral symmetry, an effect previously dubbed as chiral vortical catalysis. For the chiral susceptibility we observe stronger fluctuations around the transition temperature when we consider the running coupling. The phase diagram is affected by these findings shifting the critical end point (CEP) to higher temperatures and chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>
