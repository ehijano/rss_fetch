      <title>Self-consistent equations and quantum diffusion for the Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson tight-binding model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, with Gaussian noise and at low disorder $\lambda&gt;0$. We derive a diffusive scaling limit for the entries of the resolvent $R(z)$ at imaginary part $\operatorname*{Im} z\sim\lambda^{2+\kappa_d}$, $\kappa_d&gt;0$, with high probability. As consequences, we establish quantum diffusion (in a time-averaged sense) for the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator at the longest timescale known to date and improve the best available lower bounds on the localization length of eigenfunctions. Our results for $d=2$ are the first quantum diffusion results for the Anderson model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The proof avoids the use of diagrammatic expansions and instead proceeds by analyzing certain self-consistent equations for $R(z)$. This is facilitated by new estimates for $\|R(z)\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow \ell^q}$ that control the recollisions.</description>

      <title>Skewness of von Neumann entropy over Bures-Hall random states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the degree of entanglement, as measured by von Neumann entropy, of bipartite systems over the Bures-Hall ensemble. Closed-form expressions of the first two cumulants of von Neumann entropy over the ensemble have been recently derived in the literature. In this paper, we focus on its skewness by calculating the third cumulant that describes the degree of asymmetry of the distribution. The main result is an exact closed-form formula of the third cumulant, which leads to a more accurate approximation to the distribution of von Neumann entropy. The key to obtaining the result lies on finding a dozen of new summation identities in simplifying a large number of finite summations involving polygamma functions.</description>

      <title>Lie Algebra Contractions and Interbasis Expansions on Two-Dimensional Hyperboloid IIB. Non-Subgroup Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes solutions of the Laplace-Beltrami equation on two-dimensional two-sheeted hyperboloid for three non-subgroup coordinate systems: semi-sircular parabolic, elliptic parabolic and hyperbolic parabolic. The coefficients of interbasis expansions of solutions in the specified coordinate systems through some subgroup bases are calculated. A contraction procedure for all normalized eigenfunctions in three non-subgroup coordinate systems from the hyperboloid to the Euclidean plane is realized.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel on Warped Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the scalar Laplacian on a $n$-dimen\-sional warped product manifold $M=\Sigma\times_f N$ with a $(n-1)$-dimensional compact manifold $N$ without boundary, a one dimensional manifold $\Sigma$ without boundary and a warping function $f\in C^\infty(\Sigma)$. We consider two cases: $\Sigma=S^1$ when the manifold $M$ is compact, and $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}$ when the manifold $M$ is non-compact. In the latter case we assume that the warping function $f$ is such that the manifold $M$ has two cusps with a finite volume. In particular, we study the case of the warping function $f(y)=[\cosh(y/b)]^{-2\nu/(n-1)}$ in detail, where $y\in\mathbb{R}$ and $b$ and $\nu$ are some positive parameters. We study the properties of the spectrum of the Laplacian in detail and show that it has both the discrete and the continuous spectrum. We compute the resolvent, the eigenvalues, the scattering matrix, the heat kernel and the regularized heat trace. We compute the asymptotics of the regularized heat trace of the Laplacian on the warped manifold $M$ and show that some of its coefficients are global in nature expressed in terms of the zeta function on the manifold $N$.</description>

      <title>A holographic connection between strings and causal diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore ideas of holography and strings living in the $d+1$ dimensional Anti-de Sitter space $AdS_{d+1}$ in a unified framework borrowed from twistor theory. In our treatise of correspondences between geometric structures of the bulk $AdS_{d+1}$, its boundary and the moduli space of boundary causal diamonds aka the kinematic space ${\mathbb K}$, we adopt a perspective offered by projective geometry. From this viewpoint certain lines in the $d+1$ dimensional real projective space, defined by two light-like vectors in ${\mathbb R}^{d,2}$ play an important role. In these projective geometric elaborations objects like Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces, spacelike geodesics with horospheres providing regularizators for them and the metric on ${\mathbb K}$ all find a natural place. Then we establish a connection between classical strings in $AdS_{d+1}$ and the causal diamonds of its asymptotic boundary. We also study how the string equations of motion result in a dynamics of the boundary causal diamonds. A procedure for lifting up a causal diamond to get a proper string world sheet is developed. In this context we identify an emerging $SO(1,1)\times SO(1,d-1)$ gauge structure incorporated into a Grassmannian $\sigma$-model targeted in ${\mathbb K}$. The $d=2$ case is worked out in detail. Surprisingly in this case AdS$_3$ with its strings seems to be a natural object which is living inside projective twistor space. On the other hand ${\mathbb K}$ (comprising two copies of two dimensional de Sitter spaces) is a one which is living inside the Klein quadric, as a real section of a complexified space time.</description>

      <title>The Zigzag Strategy for Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a very general class of $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices is in the delocalized phase when the band width $W$ exceeds the critical threshold, $W\gg \sqrt{N}$. In this regime, we show that, in the bulk spectrum, the eigenfunctions are fully delocalized, the eigenvalues follow the universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and quantum unique ergodicity holds for general diagonal observables with an optimal convergence rate. Our results are valid for general variance profiles, arbitrary single entry distributions, in both real-symmetric and complex-Hermitian symmetry classes. In particular, our work substantially generalizes the recent breakthrough result of Yau and Yin [arXiv:2501.01718], obtained for a specific complex Hermitian Gaussian block band matrix. The main technical input is the optimal multi-resolvent local laws -- both in the averaged and fully isotropic form. We also generalize the $\sqrt{\eta}$-rule from [arXiv:2012.13215] to exploit the additional effect of traceless observables. Our analysis is based on the zigzag strategy, complemented with a new global-scale estimate derived using the static version of the master inequalities, while the zig-step and the a priori estimates on the deterministic approximations are proven dynamically.</description>

      <title>A Directional-ODE Framework for Discretization of Advection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach that redefines the traditional interpretation of explicit and implicit discretization methods for solving a general class of advection-diffusion equations (ADEs) featuring nonlinear advection, diffusion operators, and potential source terms. By reformulating the discrete ADEs as directional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along temporal or spatial dimensions, we derive analytical solutions that lead to novel update formulas. In essence, the information of discrete ADEs is compressed into these directional ODEs, which we refer to as representative ODEs. The analytical update formulas derived from the representative ODEs significantly enhance stability, computational efficiency, and spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, we extend the framework to systems with uncertain parameters and coefficients, showcasing its versatility in addressing complex ADEs encountered in modeling and simulation across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum accessible information and classical entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. The optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. We prove these inequalities in the cases of state ensembles corresponding to acute or flat pyramids, thus providing the proof of the hypothesis concerning the globally information-optimal observable.</description>

      <title>Quantization commutes with reduction for coisotropic A-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a Hamiltonian $G$-manifold $X$, we define the notion of $G$-invariance of coisotropic A-branes $\mathcal{B}$. Under neat assumptions, we give a Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer type construction of a coisotropic A-brane $\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{red}}$ on $X // G$ from $\mathcal{B}$, recovering the usual construction when $\mathcal{B}$ is Lagrangian. For a canonical coisotropic A-brane $\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}$ on a holomorphic Hamiltonian $G_\mathbb{C}$-manifold $X$, there is a fibration of $(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})_{\operatorname{red}}$ over $X // G_\mathbb{C}$.
  We also show that `intersections of A-branes commute with reduction'. When $X = T^*M$ for $M$ being compact K\"ahler with a Hamiltonian $G$-action, Guillemin-Sternberg `quantization commutes with reduction' theorem can be interpreted as $\operatorname{Hom}_{X // G}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{red}}, (\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})_{\operatorname{red}}) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_X(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})^G$ with $\mathcal{B} = M$.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between new agegraphic and Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in the context of $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the universe in the context of $f(T)$ gravity with flat-FRW background and consider it to be a combination of three components: baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. We consider the new agegraphic as an alternative for dark energy and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as an alternative for dark matter. After that, first we obtain the Friedman equations and then we obtain the continuity equations in the presence of the interaction term between the dark components of the universe, so that the interaction term is considered as the flow of energy from dark matter to dark energy. In what follows, we plot the variation of the cosmological parameters of dark energy in terms of the redshift parameter by using of the power-law cosmology. Finally, we investigate the evolution and stability of the universe and report the values of the density parameters of the universe components that confirm the present model with observational data.</description>

      <title>CDF-Generated Damage Laws: Admissibility, Gamma-Convergence to Griffith Fracture, and Well-Posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a family of scalar softening laws by setting the stored-energy density $\psi(\eta)=\int_{0}^{\eta}[1-F(s)]d s$, where $F$ ranges over exponential, Cauchy, logistic, half-normal, Gudermannian, hypergeometric, radical, rational, piece-wise, and rapid-decay cumulative-distribution functions (CDFs). We prove that every such law yields a degradation map that is monotone, bounded, and dissipative, rendering the associated hyperelastic material thermodynamically admissible. Working directly in spatial dimensions $d=2,3$, we establish compactness and $\Gamma$-convergence of the CDF-based energies to a sharp-interface Griffith functional. We further show the existence of rate-independent quasi-static evolutions by constructing global energetic solutions that satisfy both stability and energy balance. These analytical results provide a rigorous bridge between the probabilistic damage formulation and Griffith-type fracture mechanics. One illustrative example is presented to show the effectiveness of the current damage laws.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and orbital stability of solitary waves for Zakharov-Ito equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Zakharov-Ito equation \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t+u_{xxx}+3uu_x+\rho\rho_x=0,
  \rho_t+{(u\rho)}_x=0.
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  We prove the local well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s&gt;3/2$ and global well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s\geq2$. When $\rho=0$, the Zakharov-Ito equation reduces to the KdV equation, hence has solitary waves with speeds $c\in(0,+\infty)$. We prove the orbital stability of these solitary waves in $H^1\times L^2$ by combining a variational approach and the framework of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss \cite{GSS1987}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the full symmetric Toda system is integrable in the sense of the Lie-Bianchi criterion, i.e. that there exists a solvable Lie algebra of vector fields of dimension $N=\dim M$ on the phase space $M$ of this system such that the system is invariant with respect to the action of these fields. The proof is based on the use of symmetries of the full symmetric system, which we described earlier in \cite{CSS23}, and the appearance of the structure of the stochastic Lie algebra in their description.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, the diffusivity and conductivity on $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Bernoulli percolation ($d \geq 2$) are infinitely differentiable in supercritical regime. This extends a result by Kozlov [Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 44 (1989), no. 2(266), pp 79 - 120]. The key to the proof is a uniform estimate for the finite-volume approximation of derivatives, which relies on the perturbed corrector equations in homogenization theory. The renormalization of geometry is then implemented in a sequence of scales to gain sufficient degrees of regularity. To handle the higher-order perturbation on percolation, new techniques, including cluster-growth decomposition and hole separation, are developed.</description>

      <title>Revisiting B\"acklund-Darboux transformations for KP and BKP integrable hierarchies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider B\"acklund-Darboux transformations for integrable hierarchies of nonlinear equations such as KP, BKP and their close relatives referred to as modified KP and Schwarzian KP. We work in the framework of the bilinear formalism based on the bilinear equations for the tau-function. This approach allows one to extend the theory to fully difference (or discrete) versions of the integrable equations and their hierarchies in a natural way. We also show how to construct the B\"acklund-Darboux transformations in the operator approach developed by the Kyoto school, in which the tau-functions are represented as vacuum expectation values of certain operators made of free fermionic fields (charged for KP and neutral for BKP).</description>

      <title>Scalar Particles on embedded submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Klein-Gordon equation and Schr\"odinger equation on curved manifolds embedded in high-dimensional manifolds to describe the motion of constrained spineless particles. We start from the equations on the main manifold and obtain the effective equations on the submanifold by degenerate additional dimensions. A geometric induced potential appears in our results.We reviewed the previous works of others and our results are consistent in the special case they calculated,We focused on discussing our results under general conditions and obtained a connection between differential geometry and physics.Especially the influence of peripheral manifolds on submanifold physics is somewhat counterintuitive.We have analyzed several explicit examples, presenting an elucidation of the interactions between the submanifold and matter fields. In one specific case, our approach derived the mass term of scalar fields on a lower-dimensional manifold through purely geometric induction. This mass term coincides with that in Kaluza-Klein theory, yet was achieved without invoking any periodic compactification constraints.</description>

      <title>Spencer Differential Degeneration Theory and Its Applications in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the compatible pair theory of principal bundle constraint systems, this paper discovers and establishes a complete Spencer differential degeneration theory. We prove that when symmetric tensors satisfy a $\lambda$-dependent kernel condition $\delta_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\lambda}(s)=0$, the Spencer differential degenerates to the standard exterior differential, thus establishing a precise bridge between the complex Spencer theory and the classical de Rham theory. One of the advances in this paper is the rigorous proof that this degeneration condition remains stable under mirror transformations, revealing the profound symmetry origins of this phenomenon. Based on these rigorous mathematical results, we construct a canonical mapping from degenerate Spencer cocycles to de Rham cohomology and elucidate its geometric meaning. Finally, we demonstrate the application potential of this theory in algebraic geometry, particularly on K3 surfaces, where we preliminarily verify that this framework can systematically identify (1,1)-Hodge classes satisfying algebraicity conditions. This work provides new perspectives and technical approaches for studying algebraic invariants using tools from constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>Irregular traces of multiple SLE(0) systems with multiple marked points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the traces of multiple SLE(0) systems with two or more additional marked points.
  For general chordal configurations, the traces correspond to the real locus of real rational functions; in the radial case, they correspond to the horizontal trajectories of residue-free quadratic differentials. In both settings, we establish the regularity of the trajectories near singularities: no spiraling occurs, and no two trajectories asymptotically converge to the same direction.
  Moreover, in the radial case with non-zero spin at the marked interior point, we show that the spin induces a spiraling behavior at the marked interior point.
  However, this regularity breaks down when multiple interior marked points are present. In such cases, trajectories may asymptotically approach the same direction, and spiraling can occur even in the absence of spin. We present explicit counterexamples generated using MATLAB, with code provided for reference.</description>

      <title>GBDT with nontrivial seeds: explicit solutions of the focusing NLS equations and the corresponding Weyl functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our GBDT (generalised B\"acklund-Darboux transformation) approach is used to construct explicit solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation in the case of the exponential seed $a \exp\{2 i (cx +dt)\}$. The corresponding Baker-Akhiezer functions and evolution of the Weyl functions are obtained as well. In particular, the solutions, which appear in the study of rogue waves, step-like solutions and $N$-modulation solutions of the NLS equation are considered. This work is an essential development of our joint work with Rien Kaashoek and Israel Gohberg, where the seed was trivial, as well as several other of our previous works.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal invariance of the multipotentialisations of the Kupershmidt equation and its higher-order hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term multipotentialisation of evolution equations in $1+1$ dimensions refers to the process of potentialising a given evolution equation, followed by at least one further potentialisation of the resulting potential equation. For certain equations this process can be applied several times to result in a finite chain of potential equations, where each equation in the chain is a potential equation of the previous equation. By a potentialisation of an equation with dependent variable $u$ to an equation with dependent variable $v$, we mean a differential substitution $v_x=\Phi^t$, where $\Phi^t$ is a conserved current of the equation in $u$. The process of multipotentialisation may lead to interesting nonlocal transformations between the equations. Remarkably, this can, in some cases, result in nonlocal invariance transformations for the equations, which then serve as iteration formulas by which solutions can be generated for all the equations in the chain. In the current paper we give a comprehensive introduction to this subject and report new nonlocal invariance transformations that result from the multipotentialisation of the Kupershmidt equation and its higher-order hierarchies. The recursion operators that define the hierarchies are given explicitly.</description>

      <title>The half-space KPZ line ensemble and its scaling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, $t \geq 1$, we show that there exists a unique $\mathbb{N}$-indexed line ensemble of random continuous curves $\mathbb{R}_{\le 0} \to \mathbb{R}$ with the following properties:
  (1) The top curve is distributed as the time-$t$ Cole--Hopf solution to the half-space KPZ equation with narrow wedge initial condition and Neumann boundary condition with parameter $\alpha$.
  (2) The line ensemble satisfies a one-sided resampling invariance property, involving softly non-intersecting Brownian motions with an attractive potential between pairs at the boundary.
  We call this object the half-space KPZ line ensemble. For $\alpha=\mu t^{-1/3}$ with $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ fixed (critical regime) and for $\alpha&gt;0$ fixed (supercritical regime), we show that the half-space KPZ line ensemble is tight under 1:2:3 KPZ scaling as $t\to\infty$. Moreover, all subsequential limits approximate a parabola and enjoy a one-sided Brownian Gibbs property, described by non-intersecting Brownian motions with pairwise interaction at the boundary. In the critical case this agrees with the half-space Airy line ensemble recently constructed by Dimitrov and Yang. In the supercritical case, we demonstrate a novel structure involving pairwise pinned Brownian motions, one of the main technical contributions of this paper.</description>

      <title>Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis to Probe Convergence in Physics-informed Neural Solvers: PIKANs vs. PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order, second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. II: Dispersive phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied, in which the effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by generally dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega&gt;0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega =: \lambda P(d\omega)$, formally defining a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ with compact support, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences constructed in the paper. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with a constant $C$ that is a factor $\approx 2.034$ larger than the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. I: The $\gamma$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the recent reformulation for the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in terms of a classical interacting Bloch spin chain model, rigorous upper and lower bounds on the critical temperature $T_c$ are obtained for the $\gamma$ model -- a version of Eliashberg theory in which the effective electron-electron interaction is proportional to $(g/|\omega_n-\omega_m|)^{\gamma}$, where $\omega_n-\omega_m$ is the transferred Matsubara frequency, $g&gt;0$ a reference energy, and $\gamma&gt;0$ a parameter. The rigorous lower bounds are based on a variational principle that identifies $(T_c/g)^\gamma$ with the largest (positive) eigenvalue of an explicitly constructed compact, self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{G}(\gamma)$. These lower bounds form an increasing sequence that converges to $T_c(g,\gamma)$. The upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$ is based on fixed point theory, proving linear stability of the normal state for $T$ larger than the upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>On the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians is of inverse-square type. The result covers general graphs embedded in $\mathbb R^D$ and general finite-range interactions without requiring assumptions about the ground state correlations. Therefore, the inverse-square critical gap scaling is a robust, universal property of finite-range frustration-free Hamiltonians. This places further limits on their ability to produce conformal field theories in the continuum limit. Our proof refines the divide-and-conquer strategy of Kastoryano and the second author through the refined Detectability Lemma of Gosset--Huang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to the Cauchy problem for the combined Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa and short-pulse (WKI-SP) equation. The solution of the Cauchy problem is first expressed in terms of the solution of a RH problem with direct scattering transform based on the Lax pair. Further through a series of deformations to the RH problem by using the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of Deift-Zhou steepest descent method, we obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations to the solution of the WKI-SP equation under a new scale $(y,t)$ in three kinds of space-time regions. The first asymptotic result from the space-time regions $ \xi:=y/t &lt;-2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta}, \alpha\beta&gt;0$ and $|\xi|&lt;\infty,\alpha\beta&lt;0$ with saddle points on $\mathbb{R}$, is characterized with solitons and soliton-radiation interaction with residual error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. The second asymptotic result from the region $ \xi &gt;-2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta}, \alpha\beta&gt;0$ without saddle point on $\mathbb{R}$, is characterized with modulation-solitons with residual error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$; These two results above are a verification of the soliton resolution conjecture for the WKI-SP equation. The third asymptotic result from a transition region $\xi \approx -2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta},\alpha\beta&gt;0$ can be expressed in terms of the solution of the Painlev\'{e} \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} equation with error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$. This is a new phenomena that the long-time asymptotics for the solution to the Cauchy problem of the WKI equation and SP equation don't possesses.</description>

Abstract: For a finite connected graph $G$ and a non-empty subset $S$ of its vertices thought of sinks, the so-called critical group (or sandpile group) $C(G, S)$ has been studied for a long time. We present a class of graphs where such an extension can be made in a unified way. Similar extension was made by Maes, C. and Redig, F. and Saada, E., but we propose a more algebraic point of view.
  Namely, consider a $C$-net $S\subset \mathbb Z^2$. We define a sandpile dynamics on $\mathbb Z^2$ with the set $S$ of sinks. For such a choice of sinks, a relaxation of any bounded state is well defined. This allows us to define a group $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ of recurrent states of this model. We show that $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ is isomorphic to a group of $S^1$-valued discrete harmonic functions on $\mathbb Z^2\setminus S$.
  Examples of $S$, for which $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ has no torsion or has all torsions, are provided. Pontryagin dual point of view is investigated. A discussion about perspectives of a sandpile group for $\mathbb Z^2$ as a projective limit concludes this work.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Drinfeld presentations for split affine Kac-Moody quantum symmetric pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{U}^\imath)$ be a split affine quantum symmetric pair of type $\mathsf{B}_n^{(1)}, \mathsf{C}_n^{(1)}$ or $\mathsf{D}_n^{(1)}$. We prove factorization and coproduct formulae for the Drinfeld-Cartan operators $\Theta_i(z)$ in the Lu-Wang Drinfeld-type presentation, generalizing the type $\mathsf{A}_n^{(1)}$ result from [Prz23]. As an application, we show that a boundary analogue of the $q$-character map, defined via the spectra of these operators, is compatible with the usual $q$-character map. As an auxiliary result, we also produce explicit reduced expressions for the fundamental weights in the extended affine Weyl groups of classical types.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. III: Einstein phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersionless limit of the standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by Einstein phonons of frequency $\Omega&gt;0$, equipped with electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$. This allows for a detailed evaluation of the general results on $T_c$ for phonons with non-trivial dispersion relation, obtained in a previous paper, (II), by the authors. The variational principle for the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal state region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, obtained in (II), simplifies as follows: If $(\lambda,\Omega,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$, where $\varpi:=\Omega/2\pi T$, and where $\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences; $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ is the dispersionless limit $P(d\omega)\to\delta(\omega-\Omega)d\omega$ of the operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ of (II). It is shown that when $\varpi \leq \sqrt{2}$, then the map $\varpi\mapsto\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$ is invertible. For $\lambda&gt;0.77$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) = \Omega f(\lambda)$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $f(\lambda)$ that converges to $f(\lambda)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,\Omega)$, which agrees with the asymptotic behavior $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) \sim C \Omega\sqrt{\lambda}$ for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $\Omega$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$, where $C_\infty := \frac{1}{2\pi}\mathfrak{k}(2)^\frac12 =0.1827262477...$ is the optimal constant, and $\mathfrak{k}(\gamma)&gt;0$ the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator for the $\gamma$ model, determined in the first paper, (I), on $T_c$ by the authors.</description>

      <title>Deeper understandings of the gauge theory for the first order inhomogeneous linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our previous study [1] has demonstrated that the gauge theory is a proper framework for characterizing the local temporal and spatial interactions in inhomogeneous elastic media. However, in that study temporal interactions were interpreted as the compensation for the loss of kinetic energy resulting from homogenization process, distinct from damping effects. In addition, that study did not account for the integration of temporal and spatial transformations, leading to the omission of some crucial information such as thermal stresses. In this paper, we address this oversight to establish generalized equations by employing a unified methodology that encompasses the integrated temporal-spatial transformations and the principle of minimum dissipation. Among many interesting new findings, we highlight that the newly derived equations are inherently consistent with the first and the second laws of thermodynamics, because this gauge theory naturally incorporates the fundamental mechanism that governs the partitioning between the dissipative and the non-dissipative energy.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport and regularity of weak Kantorovich potentials on a globally hyperbolic spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal transportation problem on a globally hyperbolic spacetime for some cost function $c_2$, which corresponds to the optimal transportation problem on a complete Riemannian manifold where the cost function is the Riemannian distance squared. Building on insights from previous studies on the Riemannian and Lorentzian case, our main goal is to investigate the regularity of $\pi$-solutions (weak versions of Kantorovich potentials), from which we can conclude, in a classical way, the existence, uniqueness and structure of an optimal transport map between given Borel probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, under suitable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, for many applications, it is important to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations and 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories beyond Toric Fano 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of birational transformations that relate toric Fano 3-folds defined by reflexive lattice polytopes can be identified with mass deformations of corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. These theories are realized by a Type IIA brane configuration known as brane brick models. We further show that the same family of birational transformations extends to more general toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, including those defined by non-reflexive toric diagrams. Under these birational transformations, the mesonic moduli spaces of the associated abelian 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories and brane brick models share the same number of generators and the same Hilbert series when refined only under the U(1)R symmetry. Since these transformations categorize toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds and their corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories into non-trivial equivalence classes, we anticipate that our findings will pave the way for a `Minimal Model Program' for quiver gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

Abstract: We consider a scattering problem generated by the Sturm-Liouville equation on a tree which consists of an equilateral compact subtree and a half-infinite lead attached to its root. We assume that the potential on the lead is identically zero while the potentials on the finite edges are real. We show how to find the shape of the tree using the S-function of the scattering problem and the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the compact tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies generalized degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz groups in geometric (Clifford) algebras. These Lie groups preserve the direct sums of the subspaces determined by the grade involution and reversion under the adjoint and twisted adjoint representations in degenerate geometric algebras. We prove that the generalized degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz groups can be defined using centralizers and twisted centralizers of fixed grades subspaces and the norm functions that are widely used in the theory of spin groups. We study the relations between these groups and consider them in the particular cases of plane-based geometric algebras and Grassmann algebras. The corresponding Lie algebras are studied. The presented groups are interesting for the study of generalized degenerate spin groups and applications in computer science, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Multiple chordal SLE($\kappa$) and quantum Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiple chordal SLE$(\kappa)$ systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, where $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ are boundary starting points and $q \in \partial \Omega$ is an additional marked boundary point.
  As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that the presence of the marked boundary point $q$ gives rise to a natural equivalence relation on partition functions. While these functions are not necessarily conformally covariant, each equivalence class contains a conformally covariant representative.
  Building on the framework introduced in \cite{Dub07}, we demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with $q = \infty$, the partition functions satisfy both the null vector equations and a dilatation equation with scaling exponent $d$.
  Using techniques from the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct two distinct families of solutions, each indexed by a topological link pattern of type $(n, m)$ with $2m \leq n$.
  In the special case $\Omega = \mathbb{H}$ and $q = \infty$, we further show that these partition functions correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Moser system, thereby extending the known correspondence beyond the standard $(2n, n)$ setting.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Driven Intermittency and Extreme Events in Turbulent Scalar Transport with a Mean Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Density of states correlations in L\'evy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetry approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We computed analytically global density-of-states correlation function $R\left(\omega\right)$ for L'evy-Rosenzveig-Porter random matrix ensemble which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. Using extension of Efetov's supersymmetry approach we calculated $R\left(\omega\right)$ exactly in all relevant ranges of $\omega$ . At relatively low $\omega\ll\Gamma$ (where $\Gamma$ corresponds to effective mini-band width) we found GUE-type oscillations with period of level spacing $\Delta$, decaying exponentially at the Thouless energy scale $E_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{\Delta\Gamma}{2\pi}}$. At high energies $\omega\gg E_{th}$ our results coincide with those obtained a cavity equation approach, demonstrating power-law decay. Inverse of the effective mini-band width $1/\Gamma$ is shown to be given by the average of the local decay times over L'evy distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules.</description>

Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the asymptotic behavior of several types of Coulomb gas integrals and construct the pure partition functions for multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ and general multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems.
  For both radial and chordal cases, we prove the linear independence of the ground state solutions $J_{\alpha}^{(m,n)}(\boldsymbol{x})$ to the null vector equations for irrational values of $\kappa \in (0,8)$.
  In particular, we show that the ground state solutions $J^{(m,n)}_\alpha \in B_{m,n}$, indexed by link patterns $\alpha$ with $m$ screening charges, are linearly independent when $\kappa$ is irrational. This is achieved by constructing, for each link pattern $\beta$, a dual functional $l_\beta \in B^{*}_{m,n}$ such that the meander matrix of the corresponding Temperley-Lieb type algebra is given by $M_{\alpha\beta} = l_{\beta}(J^{(m,n)}_\alpha)$. The determinant of this matrix admits an explicit expression and is nonzero for irrational $\kappa$, establishing the desired linear independence.
  As a consequence, we construct the pure partition functions $Z_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{x})$ of the multiple $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems for each link pattern $\alpha$ by multiplying the inverse of the meander matrix.
  This method can also be extended to the asymptotic analysis of the excited state solutions $K_{\alpha}$ in both radial and chordal cases.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>
