      <title>Robust assessment of asymmetric division in colon cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation. Recent works suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and in turn their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical frameworks. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time-lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promise to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help accounting for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity</description>

      <title>Role of intercellular adhesion in modulating tissue fluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning cell rearrangements is essential in collective cell movement that underlies cancer progression, wound repair, and embryonic development. A key question is how tissue material properties and morphology emerge from cellular factors such as cell-cell adhesion. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional active force-based model of tissue monolayers that captures the liquid-to-solid transition exhibited by tissues. Unlike the Vertex and Voronoi models, our model shows that reducing intercellular adhesion in near-confluent tissues leads to spontaneous neighbor exchanges and fluidization. Near the liquid-solid phase boundary, we also found glassy behavior characterized by subdiffusive dynamics, swirling cell motion, and non-Gaussian exponential tails in displacement distributions. These exponential tails collapse onto a single master curve, suggesting a universal 'diffusion length' in the glassy regime. Notably, we demonstrate that structural parameters based on cell shape cannot always distinguish tissue phases due to huge cell shape fluctuations that are not observed in Vertex and Voronoi models. Our general simulation framework streamlines previous approaches by removing many arbitrary features and can reproduce known model behaviors under different conditions, offering potential applications in developmental biology and physiology.</description>
