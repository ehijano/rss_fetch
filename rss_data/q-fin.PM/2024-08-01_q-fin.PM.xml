      <title>On the optimal design of a new class of proportional portfolio insurance strategies in a jump-diffusion framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an optimal investment problem associated with proportional portfolio insurance (PPI) strategies in the presence of jumps in the underlying dynamics. PPI strategies enable investors to mitigate downside risk while still retaining the potential for upside gains. This is achieved by maintaining an exposure to risky assets proportional to the difference between the portfolio value and the present value of the guaranteed amount. While PPI strategies are known to be free of downside risk in diffusion modeling frameworks with continuous trading, see e.g., Cont and Tankov (2009), real market applications exhibit a significant non-negligible risk, known as gap risk, which increases with the multiplier value. The goal of this paper is to determine the optimal PPI strategy in a setting where gap risk may occur, due to downward jumps in the asset price dynamics. We consider a loss-averse agent who aims at maximizing the expected utility of the terminal wealth exceeding a minimum guarantee. Technically, we model agent's preferences with an S-shaped utility functions to accommodate the possibility that gap risk occurs, and address the optimization problem via a generalization of the martingale approach that turns to be valid under market incompleteness in a jump-diffusion framework.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Options Trading: An End-To-End Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to options trading strategies using a highly scalable and data-driven machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional approaches that often require specifications of underlying market dynamics or assumptions on an option pricing model, our models depart fundamentally from the need for these prerequisites, directly learning non-trivial mappings from market data to optimal trading signals. Backtesting on more than a decade of option contracts for equities listed on the S&amp;P 100, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based trading strategies. We find that incorporating turnover regularization into the models leads to further performance enhancements at prohibitively high levels of transaction costs.</description>
