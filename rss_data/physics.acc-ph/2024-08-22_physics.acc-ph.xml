      <title>Beam-based Identification of Magnetic Field Errors in a Synchrotron using Deep Lie Map Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental validation of the Deep Lie Map Network (DLMN) approach for recovering both linear and non-linear optics in a synchrotron. The DLMN facilitates the construction of a detailed accelerator model by integrating charged particle dynamics with machine learning methodology in a data-driven framework. The primary observable is the centroid motion over a limited number of turns, captured by beam position monitors. The DLMN produces an updated description of the accelerator in terms of magnetic multipole components, which can be directly utilized in established accelerator physics tools and tracking codes for further analysis. In this study, we apply the DLMN to the SIS18 hadron synchrotron at GSI for the first time.
  We discuss the validity of the recovered linear and non-linear optics, including quadrupole and sextupole errors, and compare our results with alternative methods, such as the LOCO fit of a measured orbit response matrix and the evaluation of resonance driving terms. The small number of required trajectory measurements, one for linear and three for non-linear optics reconstruction, demonstrates the method's time efficiency. Our findings indicate that the DLMN is well-suited for identifying linear optics, and the recovery of non-linear optics is achievable within the capabilities of the current beam position monitor system. We demonstrate the application of DLMN results through simulated resonance diagrams in tune space and their comparison with measurements. The DLMN provides a novel tool for analyzing the causal origins of resonances and exploring potential compensation schemes.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Synchrotron Radiation Studies in the EIC Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a cutting-edge particle accelerator aimed at investigating the fundamental structure of matter by colliding high-energy polarized electron beams with ions. To explore dense gluon systems and uncover the origins of nucleon mass and spin, the EIC will operate at high beam currents and luminosities. However, this approach raises beam-induced background rates, notably from synchrotron radiation (SR), which poses significant challenges to the performance and longevity of the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) general-purpose spectrometer placed at the interaction point (IP).
  This paper presents a newly developed Monte-Carlo simulation framework for accurately modeling SR backgrounds in the detector, focusing on the reflection of X-ray photons on vacuum-metal interfaces. Utilizing the extensive capabilities of Geant4 for particle-matter interactions and propagation through the geometry, the study provides first estimates of SR rates in ePIC. The results also propose countermeasures to protect sensitive electronics, ensuring stable and reliable detector operation within the EIC environment.</description>
