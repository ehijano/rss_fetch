      <title>Ordered set partition posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lattice of partitions of a set and its d-divisible generalization have been much studied for their combinatorial, topological, and respresentation-theoretic properties. An ordered set partition is a set partition where the subsets are listed in a specific order. Ordered set partitions appear in combinatorics, number theory, permutation polytopes, and the study of coinvariant algebras. The ordered set partitions of {1,...,n} can be partially ordered by refinement and then a unique minimal element attached, resulting in a lattice Omega_n. But this lattice has received no attention to our knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive look at Omega_n. In particular, we determine its M\"obius function, show that it admits a recursive atom ordering, and study the action of the symmetric group S_n on associated homology groups, looking in particular at the multiplicity of the trivial representation. We also consider the related posets where every block has size either divisible by some fixed d at least 2, or congruent to 1 modulo d.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Non Hausdorff Counterexample in Covering Space Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a one dimensional, second countable, simply connected manifold that exhibits a single non Hausdorff fiber, sufficient to destroy the fundamental properties of classical covering space theory. The space, called the line with k inseparable origins, is defined by taking k copies of the real line and identifying all nonzero points across copies, so that each copy retains a distinct origin. These origins are T1 separated but not Hausdorff separated.
  We embed the punctured real line into a closed disk with a single accumulation point, and project the nonzero locus homeomorphically onto the embedded image. The projection map collapses all origins to the puncture point. Away from the singular point, the map is a local homeomorphism. At the singular point, however, the fiber is non Hausdorff: every neighborhood of one origin contains the others.
  As a consequence, path lifting and homotopy lifting fail, the monodromy representation is undefined, and the group of deck transformations is isomorphic to the symmetric group on k letters. Despite the total space being simply connected, the map cannot be classified as a covering map, branched cover, semicovering, or \'etale morphism.
  This provides a minimal dimensional, fully explicit example showing that the failure of Hausdorff separation at a single fiber suffices to break lifting properties and eliminate the usual Galois type correspondence between fundamental groups and deck transformations. It presents a sharp obstruction to any naive extension of covering space theory to non Hausdorff settings.</description>
