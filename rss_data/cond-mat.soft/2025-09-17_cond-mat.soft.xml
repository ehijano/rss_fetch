      <title>An Assembly-Line Mechanism for In-Vitro Encapsulation of Fragmented Cargo in Virus-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of virus shells to encapsulate a wide range of functional cargoes, especially multiple cargoes - siRNAs, enzymes, and chromophores - has made them an essential tool in biotechnology for advancing drug delivery applications and developing innovative new materials. Here we present a mechanistic study of the processes and pathways that lead to multiple cargo encapsulation in the co-assembly of virus shell proteins with ligand-coated nanoparticles. Based on the structural identification of different intermediates, enabled by the contrast in electron microscopy provided by the metal nanoparticles that play the cargo role, we find that multiple cargo encapsulation occurs by self-assembly via a specific ``assembly line'' pathway that is different from previously described \emph{in vitro} assembly mechanisms of virus-like particles (VLP). The emerging model explains observations that are potentially important for delivery applications, for instance, the pronounced nanoparticle size selectivity.</description>

      <title>The self-assembly behavior of a diblock copolymer/homopolymer induced by Janus nanorods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ cell dynamics simulation based on the CH/BD model to investigate the self-assembly behavior of a mixed system consisting of diblock copolymers (AB), homopolymers (C), and Janus nanorods. The results indicate that, at different component ratios, the mixed system undergoes various phase transitions with an increasing number of nanorods. Specifically, when the homopolymer component is 0.40, the mixed system transitions from a disordered structure to a parallel lamellar structure, subsequently to a tilted layered structure, and ultimately to a perpendicular lamellar structure as the number of nanorods increases. To explore this phenomenon in greater depth, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of domain sizes and pattern evolution. Additionally, we investigate the effects of the repulsive interaction strength between polymers, wetting strength, length of nanorods, and degree of asymmetry on the self-assembly behavior of the mixed system. This research provides significant theoretical and experimental insights for the preparation of novel nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Quasi-static shape control of soft, morphing structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by biological systems, we introduce a general framework for quasi-static shape control of human-scale structures under slowly varying external actions or requirements. In this setting, shape control aims to traverse the stable sub-manifolds of the equilibrium set to meet some predefined requirements or optimization criteria. As finite deformations are allowed, the equilibrium set may have a non-trivial topology. This paper explores the implications of large shape changes and high compliance, such as the emergence of unstable equilibria and equilibrium sets with non-trivial topology. We identify various adaptivity scenarios, ranging from inverse kinematics to optimization and path planning problems, and discuss the role of time-dependent loads and requirements. The applicability of the proposed concepts is demonstrated through the example of a curved Kirchhoff rod that is susceptible to snap-through behavior.</description>

      <title>Electro-viscoelasticity of polymer melts in continuum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-viscoelastic theory for polymer melts has been extensively studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes. However, the modeling and theory for this have been minimal, leaving many questions on the mechanisms and behavior of an arbitrary flow scheme. To remedy this, previously solved overdamped Langevin equations for the Doi-Rouse model are modified to include charge and electric field potential forces. The charge sequence on the chain is hypothesized to be a cosine sequence along the chain, resembling multiple electric dipoles that conveniently correspond to a Rouse mode of the chain. These are then solved for the shear stress under homogeneous shear rates and electric fields to find directional viscosity increases depending on the shearing and electric field orientation. Using the newly derived shear stress from the Doi-Rouse approach, a continuum model is proposed that resembles a modified upper-convected Maxwell model, including polarization stresses in terms of an electric field dyadic. This new continuum model, named the upper-convected electro-Maxwell model, is verified using Kremer-Grest polymer chains simulated with molecular dynamics for multiple flow schemes and a specified charge sequence along the chain. Furthermore, the MD results verified the difference in the overall and charge sequence relaxation times through the shear and normal stress polarizations, showing the necessity for the upper-convected derivative of the electric field dyadic to correct the viscosity scaling. Finally, the dynamic properties of the polarized polymer melt are examined analytically, finding that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field contribution.</description>

      <title>The Key Physics of Ice Premelting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>

      <title>Aerophilic Debubbling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we characterize quantitatively the complex phenomenon of debubbling via aerophilic membranes by examining local interactions at the scale of single bubbles. We identify three asymptotic limits of evacuation dictated by Rayleigh, Ohnesorge and Darcy dynamics, the physics of which we capture using simple scaling laws. We show that beyond a threshold permeability, bubble evacuations become constant in time - a feature we understand as an inertio-capillary limit. Our experiments reveal that the fastest bubble evacuations require an interface that is nearly a liquid, but not quite.</description>

      <title>Anomalous statistics in the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity: from Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion to anomalous diffusion and ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusive motion is a fundamental transport mechanism in physical and biological systems, governing dynamics across a wide range of scales -- from molecular transport to animal foraging. In many complex systems, however, diffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking phenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous diffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature characterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Anomalous diffusion, in contrast, involves a nonlinear time dependence of the MSD and often reflects mechanisms such as trapping, viscoelasticity, heterogeneity, or active processes. Both phenomena challenge the conventional framework based on constant diffusivity and Gaussian statistics. This review focuses the theoretical modelling of such behaviour via the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity (LEFD) -- a flexible stochastic framework that captures essential features of diffusion in heterogeneous media. LEFD not only accounts for BYNGD but also naturally encompasses a wide range of anomalous transport phenomena, including subdiffusion, ageing, and weak ergodicity breaking. Ergodicity is discussed in terms of the correspondence between time and ensemble averages, as well as the trajectory-to-trajectory variability of time-averaged observables. The review further highlights the empirical relevance of LEFD and related models in explaining diverse experimental observations and underscores their value to uncovering the physical mechanisms governing transport in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Local Point-Group-Symmetry Order in Complex Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependent structure of neat liquid methanol, CH3OH: molecular dynamics simulations with various united atom type potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been conducted on neat liquid methanol, using three different united atom (three site) interatomic potentials: TraPPE [J. Phys. Chem. B 105, 3093 (2001)], UAM-I [J. Mol. Liq. 323, 114576 (2021)] and OPLS/2016 [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 034508 (2016)]. The effects of pressure, between 1 bar and 6 kbar, have been evaluated on total scattering structure factors, partial radial distribution functions, as well as on collective characteristics such as ring size distributions and cluster size distributions. Agreement with experimental density is nearly quantitative for all the three force fields, and major trends observed for recent pressure dependent neutron diffraction data are reproduced qualitatively. The OPLS/2016 force field, in general, generates properties that are markedly different from results originating from the other potentials. Pressure effects are hardly noticeable on most partial radial distribution functions and on the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonded neighbours. On the other hand, collective structural properties, like cluster- and ring size distributions exhibit significant changes with increasing pressure: larger clusters become more numerous, whereas the number of cyclic clusters, i.e., rings, decrease. The self-diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing pressure, and the same is valid for the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking thermostat algorithms in molecular dynamics simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic comparison was carried out to assess the influence of representative thermostat methods in constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. The thermostat schemes considered include the Nos\'e--Hoover thermostat and its chain generalisation, the Bussi velocity rescaling method, and several implementations of the Langevin dynamics. Using a binary Lennard-Jones liquid as a model glass former, we investigated how the sampling of physical observables, such as particle velocities and potential energy, responds to changes in time step across these thermostats. While the Nos\'e--Hoover chain and Bussi thermostats provide reliable temperature control, a pronounced time-step dependence was observed in the potential energy. Amongst the Langevin methods, the Gr{\o}nbech-Jensen--Farago scheme provided the most consistent sampling of both temperature and potential energy. Nonetheless, Langevin dynamics typically incurs approximately twice the computational cost due to the overhead of random number generation, and exhibits a systematic decrease in diffusion coefficients with increasing friction. This study presents a broad comparison of thermostat methods using a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model, offering practical guidance for the choice of thermostats in classical molecular dynamics simulations. These findings provide useful insights for diverse applications, including glass transition, phase separation, and nucleation.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of planar crack fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for predicting fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. However, large and localized disturbances to crack motion induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.</description>

      <title>The transition to collective motion in nonreciprocal active matter: coarse graining agent-based models into fluctuating hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two hallmarks of non-equilibrium systems, from active colloids to animal herds, are agents motility and nonreciprocal interactions. Their interplay creates feedback loops leading to complex spatiotemporal dynamics crucial to understand and control the nonlinear response of active systems. Here, we introduce a minimal model that captures these two features at the microscopic scale, while admitting an exact hydrodynamic theory valid also in the fully-nonlinear regime. Our goal is to account for the fact that animal herds and colloidal swarms are rarely in the thermodynamic limit where particle number fluctuations can be completely ignored. Using statistical mechanics techniques we exactly coarse-grain a nonreciprocal microscopic model into a fluctuating hydrodynamics and use dynamical systems insights to analyze the resulting equations. In the absence of motility, we find two transitions to oscillatory phases occurring via distinct mechanisms: a Hopf bifurcation and a Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC) bifurcation. In the presence of motility, this rigorous approach, complemented by numerical simulations, allows us to quantitatively assess the hitherto neglected impact of inter-species nonreciprocity on a paradigmatic transition in active matter: the emergence of collective motion. When nonreciprocity is weak, we show that flocking is accelerated and bands tend to synchronize with a spatial overlap controlled by nonlinearities. When nonreciprocity is strong, flocking is superseded by a Chase &amp; Rest dynamical phase where each species alternates between a chasing state, when they propagate, and a resting state, when they stand still. Finally, we demonstrate how fluctuations in finite systems can be harnessed to characterize microscopic non-reciprocity from macroscopic time-correlation functions, even in phases where nonreciprocal interactions do not affect the thermodynamic steady-state.</description>

      <title>Entropy of self-avoiding branching polymers: mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of branching polymers with excluded-volume interactions, by modeling them as single self-avoiding trees on a generic regular periodic lattice with coordination number $q$. Each lattice site can be occupied at most by one tree node, and the fraction of occupied sites can vary from dilute to dense conditions. By adopting the statistics of rooted-directed trees as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.</description>
