      <title>Direct Evidence for Density Wave Order in 3He Doped Two Dimensional 4He Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We previously reported the discovery of a two dimensional $^{4}$He supersolid; a state with intertwined density wave and superfluid order, observed in the second layer of $^{4}$He adsorbed on graphite. In this Letter we provide direct evidence for the density wave order, obtained by doping the layer with a small concentration of $^{3}$He atoms (impuritons). The heat capacity, magnetization and NMR relaxation times of the $^{3}$He were measured over a wide temperature range from 200 $\mu$K to 500 mK. They provide evidence for changes in the ground state in the second layer film as the amount of $^{4}$He is increased at various fixed $^{3}$He doses. Clear evidence is obtained for a solid second layer film, matching the r\a'egime of superfluid response previously observed in pure $^{4}$He films.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Frequency Combs and Pulse Generation based on Single Section Interband Cascade Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interband Cascade Lasers (ICLs) are semiconductor lasers emitting in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR 3-6 {\mu}m) and can operate as frequency combs (FCs). These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio-frequency operation. Here we show that ICLs FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at {\lambda} ~ 4.2 {\mu}m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified SWIFT spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free-running operation. Further, we show that, through active modelocking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (~100ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Vibrational States of Double-Well Potentials in the Solid State from DFT Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general approach for the simulation of quantum vibrational states of (symmetric and asymmetric) double-well potentials in molecules and materials for thermodynamic and spectroscopic applications. The method involves solving the nuclear Schr\"odinger equation associated with a one-mode potential of the type $V (Q) = aQ^2 + bQ^3 + cQ^4$ (with $a &lt; 0$ and $c &gt; 0$), and thus explicitly includes nuclear quantum effects. The potential, $V (Q)$, is obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed at displaced nuclear configurations along the selected normal mode, $Q$. The strategy has been implemented into the CRYSTAL electronic structure package and allows for i) the use of many density functional approximations, including hybrid ones, and ii) integration with a quasi-harmonic module. The method is applied to the spectroscopic characterization of soft lattice modes in two phases of the molecular crystal of thiourea: a low-temperature ferroelectric phase and a high-temperature paraelectric phase. Signature peaks associated to structural changes between the two phases are found in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which exhibit strong anharmonic character in their thermal evolution, as measured by temperature-dependent terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Extreme electron-hole drag and negative mobility in the Dirac plasma of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb drag between adjacent electron and hole gases has attracted considerable attention, being studied in various two-dimensional systems, including semiconductor and graphene heterostructures. Here we report measurements of electron-hole drag in the Planckian plasma that develops in monolayer graphene in the vicinity of its Dirac point above liquid-nitrogen temperatures. The frequent electron-hole scattering forces minority carriers to move against the applied electric field due to the drag induced by majority carriers. This unidirectional transport of electrons and holes results in nominally negative mobility for the minority carriers. The electron-hole drag is found to be strongest near-room temperature, despite being notably affected by phonon scattering. Our findings provide better understanding of the transport properties of charge-neutral graphene, reveal limits on its hydrodynamic description and also offer insight into quantum-critical systems in general.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic condensation through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>

      <title>The thermoelectric conversion efficiency problem: Insights from the electron gas thermodynamics close to a phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11000v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bottleneck in modern thermoelectric power generation and cooling is the low energy conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials. The detrimental effects of lattice phonons on performance can be mitigated, but achieving a high thermoelectric power factor remains a major problem because the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity cannot be jointly increased. The conducting electron gas in thermoelectric materials is the actual working fluid that performs the energy conversion, so its properties determine the maximum efficiency that can theoretically be achieved. By relating the thermoelastic properties of the electronic working fluid to its transport properties (considering noninteracting electron systems), we show why the performance of conventional semiconductor materials is doomed to remain low. Analyzing the temperature dependence of the power factor theoretically in 2D systems and experimentally in a thin film, we find that in the fluctuation regimes of an electronic phase transition, the thermoelectric power factor can significantly increase owing to the increased compressibility of the electron gas. We also calculate the ideal thermoelectric conversion efficiency in noninteracting electron systems across a wide temperature range neglecting phonon effects and dissipative coupling to the heat source and sink. Our results show that driving the electronic system to the vicinity of a phase transition can indeed be an innovative route to strong efficiency enhancement, but at the cost of an extremely narrow temperature range for the use of such materials, which in turn precludes potential development for the desired wide range of thermoelectric energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Spin and Orbital Hall Phenomena in Antiferromagnetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous spin and orbital Hall phenomena in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials via orbital pumping experiments. Conducting spin and orbital pumping experiments on YIG/Pt/Ir20Mn80 heterostructures, we unexpectedly observe strong spin and orbital anomalous signals in an out-of-plane configuration. We report a sevenfold increase in the signal of the anomalous inverse orbital Hall effect (AIOHE) compared to conventional effects. Our study suggests expanding the Orbital Hall angle ({\theta}_OH) to a rank 3 tensor, akin to the Spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH), to explain AIOHE. This work pioneers converting spin-orbital currents into charge current, advancing the spin-orbitronics domain in AF materials.</description>
