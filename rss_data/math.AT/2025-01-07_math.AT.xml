      <title>Unified Origami Kinematics via Cosheaf Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel local-global framework for analyzing rigid origami mechanics through cosheaf homology, proving the equivalence of truss and hinge constraint systems via an induced linear isomorphism. This approach applies to origami surfaces of various topologies, including sheets, spheres, and tori. By leveraging connecting homomorphisms from homological algebra, we link angular and spatial velocities in a novel way. Unlike traditional methods that simplify complex closed-chain systems to re-constrained tree topologies, our homological techniques enable simultaneous analysis of the entire system. This unified framework opens new avenues for homological algorithms and optimization strategies in robotic origami and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence, cross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results.
  Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one univariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction in mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal component analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series embeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give scores that are within a given epsilon of each other.
  We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several pairs of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of cross-recurrence, and show the increased accuracy and stability of our score when predicting and measuring whether or not the periodicities of two time series are similar.</description>

      <title>On the differential $K$-theory of moduli stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the connective differential $K$-theory and the differential cohomology of the moduli stack of principal $G$-bundles with connection. The results are formulated in terms of invariant polynomials and the representation ring of $G$. We use the homotopy theory of presheaves of spaces and presheaves of spectra to establish the results.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt Theorems in Higher Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem to higher algebra by establishing a version that applies to spectral Lie algebras. We deduce this statement from a basic relation between operads in spectra: the commutative operad is the quotient of the associative operad by a right action of the spectral Lie operad. This statement, in turn, is a consequence of a fundamental relation between different $\mathbb{E}_n$-operads, which we articulate and prove. We deduce a variant of the Poincar\'{e}--Birkhoff--Witt theorem for relative enveloping algebras of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras. Our methods also give a simple construction and description of the higher enveloping $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras of a spectral Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Equivariant operads, symmetric sequences, and Boardman-Vogt tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance the foundational study of be Nardin-Shah's $\infty$-category of $G$-operads and their associated $\infty$-categories of algebras. In particular, we construct the underlying $G$-symmetric sequence of a (one color) $G$-operad, yielding a monadic functor; we use this to lift Bonventre's genuine operadic nerve to a conservative functor of $\infty$-categories, restricting to an equivalence between categories of discrete $G$-operads. Using this, we extend Blumberg-Hill's program concerning $\mathcal{N}_\infty$-operads to arbitrary sub-operads of the terminal $G$-operad, which we show are equivalent to weak indexing systems.
  We then go on to define and characterize a homotopy-commutative and closed Boardman-Vogt tensor product on $\mathrm{Op}_G$; in particular, this specializes to a $G$-symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of $\mathcal{O}$-algebras in a $G$-symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category whose $\mathcal{P}$-algebras are objects with interchanging $\mathcal{O}$-algebra and $\mathcal{P}$-algebra structures.</description>

      <title>Topological Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.07748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sunada's work on crystallography emphasizes the role of the "maximal abelian cover" of a graph $X$. This is a covering space of $X$ for which the group of deck transformations is the first homology group $H_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$. An embedding of the maximal abelian cover in a vector space can serve as the pattern for a crystal: atoms are located at the vertices, while bonds lie along the edges. We prove that for any connected graph $X$ without bridges, there is a canonical embedding of the maximal abelian cover of $X$ into the vector space $H_1(X,\mathbb{R})$, called a "topological crystal". Crystals of graphene and diamond are examples of this construction. We prove that any symmetry of a graph lifts to a symmetry of its topological crystal. We also compute the density of atoms in a topological crystal. The key technical tools are a way of decomposing the 1-chain coming from a path in $X$ into manageable pieces, and the work of Bacher, de la Harpe and Nagnibeda on integral cycles and integral cuts.</description>

      <title>Exact structures for persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss applications of exact structures and relative homological algebra to the study of invariants of multiparameter persistence modules. This paper is mostly expository, but does contain a pair of novel results. Over finite posets, classical arguments about the relative projective modules of an exact structure make use of Auslander-Reiten theory. One of our results establishes a new adjunction which allows us to ``lift'' these arguments to certain infinite posets over which Auslander-Reiten sequences do not always exist. We give several examples of this lifting, in particular highlighting the non-existence and existence of resolutions by upsets when working with finitely presentable representations of the plane and of the closure of the positive quadrant, respectively. We then restrict our attention to finite posets. In this setting, we discuss the relationship between the global dimension of an exact structure and the representation dimension of the incidence algebra of the poset. We conclude with our second novel contribution. This is an explicit description of the irreducible morphisms between relative projective modules for several exact structures which have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Controllable Subspaces in Structured Networks of Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graphs: Controllability of Individual Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of structured networks, this paper introduces the concept of the Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (FSSCS), enabling a comprehensive characterization of controllable subspaces. From a graph-theoretical viewpoint, the paper defines Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable (FSSC) nodes based on the FSSCS concept and establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for their identification. This paper proposes a method for determining the exact dimension of the Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (SSCS) in hierarchical directed acyclic graphs, employing a blend of graph-theoretical approaches and controllability matrix analyses. This approach not only facilitates the identification of FSSC nodes but also enhances our understanding of the robustness of node controllability against variations in network parameters within structured networks, marking a significant advancement in the field of strong structural controllability of individual nodes.</description>

      <title>Double complexes for configuration spaces and hypergraphs on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hypergraphs whose vertices are distinct points moving smoothly on a Riemannian manifold $M$. We take these hypergraphs as graded submanifolds of configuration spaces. We construct double complexes of differential forms on configuration spaces. Then we construct double complexes of differential forms on hypergraphs which are sub-double complexes of the double complex for the ambient configuration space. Among these double complexes for hypergraphs, the infimum double complex and the supremum double complex are quasi-isomorphic concerning the boundary maps induced from vertex deletion of the hyperedges. In particular, all the double complexes are identical if the hypergraph is a $\Delta$-submanifold of the ambient configuration space.</description>

      <title>A closed manifold is a fat CW complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new smooth version of a CW complex named a fat CW complex, and to show that it includes all closed manifolds, because existing smooth versions of CW complexes (e.g. [Iwa22]) do not have such property. We also verify that de Rham theorem holds for a fat CW complex and that a regular CW complex is reflexive in the sense of Y. Karshon, J. Watts and P. I-Zemmour. Further, any topological CW complex is topologically homotopy equivalent to a fat CW complex. So, a fat CW complex enjoys many nice properties.</description>
