      <title>Starobinsky in Stereo: SKA-CMB Synergy in SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.</description>

      <title>Constraining fuzzy dark matter with the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain valuable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark matter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark matter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum and the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are implemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation of the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM halos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic reionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark matter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm power spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a correct FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when X-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters from upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In FDM cosmologies with $m_\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to constrain the boson mass to within $\sim10$% at 2$\sigma$ confidence with a mock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent. However, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate with the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson mass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone.</description>

      <title>Machine learning analysis of Photometric data from the Dark Energy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to retrieve cosmological parameters from photometric surveys, we need to estimate the distribution of the photometric redshift in the sky with excellent accuracy. We use and apply three different machine learning methods to publicly available Dark Energy Survey data release 2 (DR2): a) Artificial Neural Network for photometric redshifts (ANNz2); b) Gaussian processes for photometric redshifts (GPz); and c) Keras, a deep learning application programming interface in Python. We compare these different techniques applied to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500 million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies, which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a $\sigma_{68}\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the order of 3 per cent.</description>

      <title>SHH method for SIDM: An SIDM-hydro hybrid method for simulating self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new scheme to couple existing numerical methods for elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to the hydrodynamic equations via a continuous function of the local Knudsen number. The method, an SIDM-hydro hybrid (SHH), allows more efficient simulation of the evolution of inhomogeneous halos deep into the regime of gravothermal collapse. With the improved efficiency gained by moving to a hydrodynamical description in high-density regions, the SHH method allows central densities of two orders of magnitude higher to be reached in considerably less simulation time than traditional methods. Our implementation should be considered as the first step toward a robust SHH method, as we interpolate the first and second moments of the Boltzmann equation in the ideal-fluid limit only. The simulation results are qualitatively similar to those found with other methods, although there are differences in the implementation of the primary physics driving the dynamics, and in the details of the resulting halo profiles. However, our results indicate that the SHH technique shows promise to investigate gravothermal collapse in diverse, dynamical environments. The method can be extended to incorporate non-ideal fluid terms and dissipation, as needed for dark-matter scenarios where interactions beyond the elastic regime may be important in the dense interiors of some halos.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurement of Large Shear Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, estimators of galaxy shape distortions are only carefully studied perturbatively in the case of small shear signals, mainly for weak lensing sciences. However, in the neighborhood of massive foreground clusters, a large number of background galaxies can be significantly distorted. The measurement of such large shear signals could be quite nontrivial under general observing conditions, i.e., in the presence of the point spread function (PSF) and noise. In this work, we propose a non-perturbative method to exactly recover large shear signals ($\gtrsim 0.5$) under general conditions. We test the method on simulated galaxy images, and find that it is accurate down to the very faint end.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.</description>

      <title>On frequentist confidence intervals in a non-Gaussian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Deflection Reconstruction: A New Technique to Search for Gravitational Waves with the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves with non-Gaussianity up to all orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Accelerating cosmological inference of interacting dark energy with neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present thesis aims to tackle two critical aspects of present and future cosmological analysis of Large-Scale Structure (LSS): accurate modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and efficient computational techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. Both are crucial for testing alternative cosmologies and avoiding spurious results. We focus on the Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark matter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\rm ds}$. To capture DS effects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\tt{ReACT}$, compute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body simulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos, finding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We then constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural emulators from $\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs, preserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing KiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\vert A_{\rm ds}\vert \lesssim 20$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\rm ds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a promising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing forecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline with $\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing computational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is evaluated with $\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into perspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations developed here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova Program: Cross Calibration, Simulations, and Cosmology Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been essential for probing the nature of dark energy; however, most SN analyses rely on the same low-redshift sample, which may lead to shared systematics. In a companion paper (Sherman et al., submitted), we introduce the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova (DEBASS) program, which has already collected more than 500 low-redshift SNe Ia on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and present an initial release of 77 SNe Ia within the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint observed between 2021 and 2024. Here, we examine the systematics, including photometric calibration and selection effects. We find agreement at the 10 millimagnitude level among the tertiary standard stars of DEBASS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. Our simulations reproduce the observed distributions of DEBASS SN light-curve properties, and we measure a bias-corrected Hubble residual scatter of $0.08$ mag, which, while small, is found in 10% of our simulations. We compare the DEBASS SN distances to the Foundation sample and find consistency with a median residual offset of $0.016 \pm 0.019$ mag. Selection effects have negligible impacts on distances, but a different photometric calibration solution shifts the median residual $-0.015 \pm 0.019$ mag, highlighting calibration sensitivity. Using conservative simulations, we forecast that replacing historical low-redshift samples with the full DEBASS sample (&gt;400 SNe Ia) will improve the statistical uncertainties on dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ by 30% and 24% respectively, enhance the dark energy Figure of Merit by up to 60%, and enable a measurement of $f\sigma_8$ at the 25% level.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova Program: Motivation, Design, Implementation, and Preliminary Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at low redshifts ($z$) serve as one of the most viable keys to unlocking our understanding of cosmic expansion, isotropy, and growth of structure. The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernovae (DEBASS) program will deliver the largest uniformly calibrated low-$z$ SN Ia data set in the southern hemisphere to date. DEBASS utilizes the Dark Energy Camera to image supernovae in conjunction with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) to gather comprehensive host galaxy information. By using the same photometric instrument as both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey, DEBASS not only benefits from a robust photometric pipeline and well-calibrated images across the southern sky, but can replace the historic and external low-$z$ samples that were used in the final DES supernova analysis. DEBASS has accumulated more than 400 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.08$ from 2021 to mid-2025, and, in this paper along with a companion paper Acevedo et al. submitted, we present an early data release of 77 SNe within the DES footprint to demonstrate the merit and constraining power of the data set. Here, we introduce the DEBASS program, discuss its scientific goals and the advantages it offers for supernova cosmology, and present our initial results. With this early data release, we find a robust median absolute standard deviation of Hubble diagram residuals of $\sim$0.10 mag and an initial measurement of the host-galaxy mass step of $0.06\pm0.04$ mag, both before performing bias corrections. This low scatter shows the promise of a low-$z$ SN Ia program with a well-calibrated telescope and high signal-to-noise ratio across multiple bands.</description>

      <title>Web-Halo Model (WHM): Accurate non-linear matter power spectrum predictions without free parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parameter-free variant of the halo model that significantly improves the precision of matter clustering predictions, particularly in the challenging 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime, where standard halo models often fail. Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters, our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting parameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by incorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments) and one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with 1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework. We show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision of state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all redshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\% accuracy up to scales of $k = 0.4\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively, for both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM} + \sum m_\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a substantial improvement over 1$\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which performs similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite its 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into existing HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation and Spin in Matter Domination Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis and neutrino mass with one right-handed neutrino and Higgs inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and minimal setup where the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino oscillation data can be satisfied with only one right-handed neutrino (RHN) and a second Higgs doublet with the latter being also responsible for driving cosmic inflation. While inflation is realised via non-minimal coupling of the Higgs to gravity, baryon asymmetry is generated via Affleck-Dine leptogenesis. Due to the presence of only two new fields beyond the standard model (BSM), the proposed setup remains very predictive with only a small allowed parameter space consistent with the PLANCK 2018 and ACT 2025 data simultaneously. The preferred mass spectrum of the BSM particles also keeps the detection prospects alive at terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Improving Optical Photo-z Constraints for Dusty Star-forming Galaxies Using Submillimeter-based Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts (photo-z's) provide an efficient alternative to spectroscopic redshifts, enabling redshift estimation for large galaxy samples. However, traditional photo-z methods primarily rely on optical and near-infrared (OIR) photometry, which can struggle with dusty star-forming galaxies that are often faint in the OIR but bright at far-infrared (FIR) and millimeter wavelengths. We present a method for incorporating FIR-to-millimeter photometry as a prior within standard OIR-based photo-z frameworks, explicitly folding in the observed empirical relationship between total infrared luminosity and dust temperature. This approach is particularly suitable for wide-area surveys, such as those anticipated with the Euclid satellite or Rubin Observatory, where OIR photo-z's can be complemented with longer-wavelength data to help with the dustiest and highest star-forming galaxies. Applying this method to the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (or H-ATLAS) catalog, which combines FIR photometry from Herschel-SPIRE with OIR observations, we achieve a threefold reduction in catastrophic outliers compared to traditional OIR-based photo-z techniques, demonstrating its utility for improving redshift estimates in FIR-bright galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to inflation beyond slow roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi approach is a powerful tool to describe super-Hubble dynamics during cosmological inflation in a non-linear way. A key assumption of this framework is to neglect anisotropic perturbations on large scales. We show that neglecting the anisotropic sector in the momentum constraint corresponds to discarding the non-adiabatic mode of scalar-field perturbations at large scales. Consequently, the Hamilton-Jacobi approach cannot be used to describe the evolution of large-scale perturbations during inflation beyond slow roll, when non-adiabatic fluctuations play an important role on super-Hubble scales due to the absence of an attractor trajectory. As an example, we analyse the case of cosmological perturbations during a phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- IX. The dense, low-mass perturbers in B1938+666 and J0946+1006: implications for cold and self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extended analysis of the gravitational lens systems SDSS J0946+1006 and JVAS B1938+666. We focus on the properties of two low-mass dark matter haloes previously detected in these systems and compare them with predictions from different dark matter models. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the object H detected in J0946+1006 is a dark-matter-dominated subhalo. Object A, in B1938+666, is a foreground halo at $z = 0.13\pm0.07$, contradicting previous analyses which suggested this object to be located either within or at higher redshift than the lens. Given the new redshift for this object, we update the 3$\sigma$ upper limit on its luminosity to $L_V &lt; 6.3 \times 10^5 {(z/0.13)}^2 L_{V,\odot}$. By selecting central galaxies from the TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, we find that analogues with projected mass density profiles around the robust radius of $\sim$ 91 pc and luminosities consistent with detection A can be found, although they lie near the edge of the halo distribution in the relevant mass and redshift ranges. We conclude, therefore, that this object is an atypical but possible event in $\Lambda$CDM. The projected mass density profile of both detections over the well-constrained range of radii may be consistent with expectations from SIDM gravothermal fluid model if the effective self-interaction cross-section $\sigma_{c,0}/m_{\rm{dm}}$ is of order $300 \ \rm{cm}^2 g^{-1}$ or larger.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Contaminant Leakage in Internal Linear Combination Maps Using a Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, the inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off high-energy electrons, is a powerful probe of hot, ionized gas in the Universe. It is often measured via cross-correlations of CMB data with large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to constrain gas physics and improve cosmological constraints. The largest source of bias to these measurements is the leakage of poorly understood thermal dust emission from star-forming galaxies -- the cosmic infrared background (CIB) -- into the tSZ maps. This CIB contamination is difficult to clean via multifrequency component separation methods, such as internal linear combination (ILC), due to uncertainty in its spectral energy distribution (SED), which exhibits spatial and line-of-sight variation and decorrelation. Thus, improved ILC-based techniques have been developed to null ("deproject") both the CIB and its first moment with respect to the emissivity index $\beta$ in order to robustly remove the CIB despite the lack of first-principles knowledge of its SED. While decreasing the bias, such procedures can significantly increase the noise in the resulting ILC maps. In this paper, we develop a data-driven algorithm for determining the optimal CIB SED to deproject when measuring a tSZ-LSS cross-correlation, obviating the need to deproject the first moment in the ILC map used for such a measurement. Our method gives an unbiased cross-correlation with increased signal-to-noise. We demonstrate its efficacy on simulations, finding a 60% improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio for an example tSZ cross-correlation with a halo sample at redshifts $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.8$, as compared to moment deprojection approaches. Though used here for CIB removal in tSZ cross-correlations, our method is broadly applicable to minimizing contaminant leakage in ILC maps. Our code is available in CIB-deproj.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Cosmic Distance Duality with Megamasers and DESI DR2: Model Independent Constraints on Early-Late Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z &lt; 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.</description>

      <title>The impact of galaxy bias on cross-correlation tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross-correlation of galaxies at different redshifts with other tracers of the large-scale structure can be used to reconstruct the cosmic mean of key physical quantities, and their evolution over billions of years, at high precision. However, a correct interpretation of these measurements must ensure that they are independent of the clustering properties of the galaxy sample used. In this paper we explore different prescriptions to extract tomographic reconstruction measurements and use the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations to show that a robust estimator, independent of the small-scale galaxy bias, can be constructed. We focus on the tomographic reconstruction of the halo bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle bP_e\rangle$ and star-formation density $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$, which can be reconstructed from tomographic analysis of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background maps, respectively. We show that these quantities can be reconstructed with an accuracy of 1-3\% over a wide range of redshifts, using different galaxy samples. We also show that these measurements can be accurately interpreted using the halo model, assuming a sufficiently reliable model can be constructed for the halo mass function, large-scale halo bias, and for the dependence of the physical quantities being reconstructed on halo mass.</description>

      <title>Combined tracer analysis for DESI 2024 BAO</title>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) and future baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) analyses can optimally combine overlapping tracers (galaxies of distinct types) in the same redshift range. We make a unified catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) in the redshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 and investigate the impact on the BAO constraints. DESI DR1 contains ~30% of the final DESI LRG sample and less than 25% of the final ELG sample, and the combination of LRGs and ELGs increases the number density and reduces the shot noise. We developed a pipeline to merge the overlapping tracers using galaxy bias as an approximately optimal weight and tested the pipeline on a suite of Abacus simulations, calibrated on the final version of the DESI Early Data Release. When applying our pipeline to the DESI DR1 catalog, we find an improvement in the BAO constraints of 11% for $\alpha_\mathrm{iso}$ and ~7.0% for $\alpha_\mathrm{AP}$ consistent with our findings in mock catalogs. Our analysis was integrated into the DESI DR1 BAO analysis to produce the LRG+ELG result in the 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 redshift bin, which provided the most precise BAO measurement from DESI DR1 with a 0.86% constraint on the BAO distance scale and a $9.1\sigma$ detection of the isotropic BAO feature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics especially the Joule-Thomson expansion of the $n$-dimensional FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe with a perfect fluid. We derive the thermodynamic equations of state $P=P(V, T)$ for the $n$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is defined by the work density $W$ of the perfect fluid, $i.e.$ $P\equiv W$. Furthermore, we present the Joule-Thomson expansion as an application of these equations of state to elucidate the cooling-heating properties of the $n$-dimensional FRW universe. We determine the inversion temperature and inversion pressure in the FRW universe with arbitrary dimensions for the first time, and illustrate the characteristics of inversion curves and isenthalpic curves in the $T$-$P$ plane. We also examine constraints on the perfect fluid in the FRW universe, as derived from the cooling-heating transition point. This study offers insights into deepening our comprehension of cooling and heating regions in the FRW universe, thereby revealing its expansion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>DAmodel: Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of DA White Dwarfs for Spectrophotometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5$) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity $\log g$, effective temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$, extinction $A_V$, dust relation parameter $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $&lt;0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Periodic Cosmic String Formation and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. If a scalar field $\Phi$ is initially displaced from the minimum of a wine-bottle potential, even if uniformly over large spatial patches, small spatial perturbations to $\Phi$ grow via parametric resonance as $\Phi$ oscillates; this occurs for a wide range of initial $U(1)$ charge densities. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially coherent, temporally stable "counter-rotating regions" (CRR): spatially connected regions exhibiting $\Phi$ evolution with large, opposite-sign rotation speeds in field space which persist over long durations. These CRR are separated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero rotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are confined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. We demonstrate these periodic dynamics with numerical simulations in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, in both Minkowski spacetime and in a radiation-dominated FLRW universe, and we explain some features of the evolution (semi-)analytically. At late times in an expanding universe, when $\Phi$ approaches the potential minimum, the CRR and vortices dissipate into scalar radiation. Phenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation and annihilation can lead to periodic bursts of gravitational-wave production. For small initial $U(1)$ charge density, these gravitational-wave bursts can be synchronized across the whole Universe. Owing to their periodic nature, they could give rise to a gravitational-wave frequency spectrum consisting of a forest of peaks. These periodic scalar field dynamics also occur with large, untuned initial $U(1)$ charge density; they may thus have implications for models that depend on a coherent field rotation, such as kination and the axion kinetic-misalignment mechanism.

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves and Laboratory Searches as Complementary Probes of Right-handed Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the damping of inflationary gravitational waves (GW) that re-enter the Hubble horizon before or during a post-inflationary era dominated by a meta-stable, right-handed neutrino (RHN), whose out-of-equilibrium decay releases entropy. Within a minimal type-I seesaw extension of the Standard Model (SM), we explore the conditions under which the population of thermally produced RHNs remain long-lived and cause a period of matter-domination. We find that the suppression of the GW spectrum occurs above a characteristic frequency determined by the RHN mass and active-sterile mixing. For RHN masses in the range $0.1$-$10$ GeV and mixing $10^{-12} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-5}$, we estimate such characteristic frequencies and the signal-to-noise ratio to assess the detection prospects in GW observatories such as THEIA, $\mu$-ARES, LISA, BBO and ET. Additionally we use LIGO data to put upper bounds on the reheating temperature after inflation, for a given blue-tilted GW spectrum. We find complementarity between GW signals and laboratory searches in SHiP, DUNE and LEGEND-1000. Notably, RHN masses of $0.2$-$2$ GeV and mixing $10^{-10} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-7}$ are testable in both laboratory experiments and GW observations. Additionally, GW experiments can probe the canonical seesaw regime of light neutrino mass generation, a region largely inaccessible to laboratory searches.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity $f_{\mathcal{R}}=1+c{\mathcal{R}} \phi^{n/2}$ with a kinetic mixing of the form $f_K = f_{\mathcal{R}}^m$ -- where $n=2$ and 4 and $0.5 \le m \le 10$ -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the $\phi^n$ potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <title>Light PIDM in Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Planckian Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM), which interacts exclusively through gravity, typically requires heavy DM candidates (with mass $10^3-10^{15}$ GeV) and very high reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 10^{15}$ GeV). In this article, we explore a novel realization of PIDM in warped five-dimensions, consisting of an "Ultra Violet"$-$"Dark"$-$"Infra Red" (UV-DB-IR) brane setup, where the DM can be a Dark brane composite light state with mass 1 MeV $-$ 1 TeV. The DM sector is assumed to interact solely via gravity in five-dimensions. After orbifolding and performing a Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, the DM is assumed to be localized onto the DB, which is positioned in the extra-dimension such that the DM interacts with both the massless graviton and its massive KK excitations, with suppressed couplings to remain consistent with the ethos of the PIDM framework. The light (heavy) Standard Model matter is assumed to be localized near UV (IR) branes for the geometric Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, while their KK modes are localized close to the IR brane. We show that this construction allows for a viable and efficient freeze-in production mechanism for light composite PIDM, consistent with TeV-scale reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>ACT-Inspired Kaehler-Based Inflationary Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with the recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler potentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the inflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1&lt; p&lt;10. The combination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4) within a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are consistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n. Endowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity realization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The attainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional attractive features of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Bias with a Timer: Axion Domain Wall Decay and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of the post-inflationary QCD axion and a light scalar field for the axion domain wall decay and dark matter (DM). The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the (trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can decay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and the correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than that of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.</description>
