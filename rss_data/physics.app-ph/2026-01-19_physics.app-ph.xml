      <title>Supercritical Snapping and Controlled Launching via Dual Latch Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural organisms have evolved integrated Latch-Mediated Spring Actuation systems (LaMSA) that consist of multiple latches and springs to enhance power output and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. Similar designs are appealing yet largely unexplored in engineered materials due to the complexity of integrating multiple components into a single material platform. Here, we report a dual-latched magneto-elastic shell device capable of selectively activating the latches to regulate snapping pathways and energy output based on specific actuation requirements. Differential deswelling across the thickness acts as the motor to load the elastic energy into the shell, which is then released via the snap-through instability once the loading reaches the critical threshold, constituting an intrinsic mechanical latch. Activation of the external magnetic latch delays snapping onset beyond the threshold of the intrinsic latch, leading to a power-amplified supercritical snap-through instability as well as a bifurcation instability. The combined function of both latches allows for flexible control over energy storage and release. Additionally, this integrated LaMSA system possesses an untethered anchoring mechanism, enabling the device to launch in arbitrary directions from the substrate, driven by the energy released during snapping. We envision that the design principles of dual-latched LaMSA systems will create opportunities for power-dense actuation in engineered materials and robotic devices.</description>

      <title>ATSim3D: Towards Accurate Thermal Simulator for Heterogeneous 3D-IC Systems Considering Nonlinear Leakage and Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal simulation plays a fundamental role in the thermal design of integrated circuits, especially 3D ICs. Current simulators require significant runtime for high-resolution simulation, and dismiss the complex nonlinear thermal effects, such as nonlinear thermal conductivity and leakage power. To address these issues, we propose ATSim3D, a thermal simulator for simulating the steady-state temperature profile of nonlinear and heterogeneous 3D IC systems. We utilize the global-local approach, combining a compact thermal model at the global level, and a finite volume method at the local level. We tackle the nonlinear effects with Kirchhoff transformation and iteration. ATSim3D enables local-level parallelization that helps achieve an average speedup of 40x compared to COMSOL, with a relative error &lt;3% and a state-of-the-art resolution of 4096 x 4096, holding promise for enhancing thermal-aware design in 3D ICs.</description>

      <title>ATSim3.5D: A Multiscale Thermal Simulator for 3.5D-IC Systems based on Nonlinear Multigrid Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To resolve the rising temperatures in 3.5D-ICs, a thermal-aware design flow becomes increasingly crucial, necessitating an accurate and efficient thermal simulation tool. However, previous tools struggle to handle the unique heterogeneous multiscale structures in 3.5D-ICs and the nonlinear thermal effects caused by high temperatures. In this work, we present a multiscale thermal simulator for 3.5D-ICs. We propose a hybrid tree structure to generate multilevel grids and capture the multiscale features and employ the nonlinear multigrid method for quick solving. Compared to ANSYS Icepak, it exhibits high accuracy (mean absolute relative error &lt;1%, max error $&lt;\SI{2}{\degreeCelsius}$), and efficiency ($80\times$ acceleration), delivering a powerful means to evaluate and refine thermal designs.</description>

      <title>Metagratings on Low-Cost Substrates for Efficient Anomalous Reflection: Addressing Dielectric Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework and practical methodology for designing high-efficiency metagratings (MGs), sparse periodic arrangements of subwavelength polarizable particles (meta-atoms), on low-cost dielectric substrates with non-negligible losses. The formulation incorporates these losses and exploits multiple degrees of freedom to optimize beam manipulation efficiency within a simple realistic printed-circuit-board (PCB) configuration. Importantly, the various loss mechanisms are analyzed using a judiciously devised equivalent circuit model, providing insights on their respective contributions. We validate our theory by designing, fabricating, and experimentally characterizing an efficient FR4-based anomalous reflection PCB MG, demonstrating good agreement between analytical predictions, full-wave simulations, and laboratory measurements. This work opens avenues for realizing efficient, low-profile, beam manipulation devices at reduced cost, offering practical solutions to mitigate loss limitations in diverse material sets across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Compositional and morphological study of a Nuragic bronze figurine with neutron diffraction and neutron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuragic figurines are rare and unique examples of the mastery achieved by Sardinian craftsmen in the early Iron Age. These bronze artefacts were most likely cast using the lost wax technique: the shapes were moulded with relative ease, and even complex figures could be represented. However, the manufacturing process was not always a single-step solution: in some cases, the parts of the model were moulded separately and then assembled in a second place. The analytical study of these artefacts can help to understand the specific casting methods and to evaluate the techniques implemented by Sardinian craftsmen to produce such complex objects. In recent years, neutron diffraction (ND) and neutron imaging (NI) have proven to be among the most effective methods for non-invasive studies. ND and NI provide complementary quantitative and morphological information that can be the key to understanding the casting processes. In this work, the results of the analysis of a bronze figurine will be reported. The statuette represents a Nuragic warrior and was made available by the Soprintendenza Archeologia Belle Arti e Paesaggio per le province di Sassari e Nuoro (Sassari, Italy).</description>

      <title>In situ and operando laboratory X-ray absorption spectroscopy at high temperature and controlled gas atmosphere with a plug-flow fixed-bed cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of a plug-flow fixed-bed cell for operando studies of heterogeneous catalysts are demonstrated using laboratory-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with a von Hamos spectrometer. The cell operates at temperatures up to 1000 deg C and pressures up to 10 bar, equipped with three mass flow controllers and two infrared lamps for rapid heating under inert/reactive gas atmospheres. Proof-of-principle studies include in situ MnO oxidation in 5% Ni/MnO and operando Ni nanoparticle evolution in 20-NiO/COK-12 (20.2% NiO on SiO2) during CO2 methanation before/after activation. Within 5-15 min per spectrum, oxidation state changes are resolved while catalytic activity is simultaneously quantified by online GC. Extended datasets and methods are available in the ancillary file SI.pdf (Supplementary Information file). A shortened version is submitted to Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry as a Technical Note.</description>

      <title>A Novel, Beam-based Formalism for Active Impedance of Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The active impedance is a fundamental parameter for characterizing the behavior of large, uniform phased array antennas. However, its conventional calculation via the mutual impedance matrix (or the scattering matrix) offers limited physical intuition and can be computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel derivation of the active impedance directly from the radiated beam pattern of such arrays. This approach maps the scan-angle variation of the active impedance directly to the intrinsic angular variation of the beam, providing a more intuitive physical interpretation. The theoretical derivation is straightforward and rigorous. The validity of the proposed equation is conclusively confirmed through full-wave simulations of a prototype array. This work establishes a new and more intuitive framework for understanding, analyzing and accurately measuring the scan-dependent variations in phased arrays, which is one of the main challenges in modern phased array designs. Consequently, this novel formalism is expected to expedite and simplify the overall design and optimization process for next-generation, large-scale uniform phased arrays.</description>

      <title>Generation and Enhancement of Persistent Nanoscale Magnetization in All-Dielectric Metasurfaces by Optically Injected and Localized Free Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying dielectric metasurfaces supporting sharp optical resonances with a non-trivial electromagnetic field distribution represent a unique platform for realizing temporal interfaces for metasurface-guided waves (MGWs). Rapidly changing metasurface resonance enables frequency conversion and temporal scattering of a concurrently propagating MGW. Using analytical methods and electromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that localized free-carrier generation can be engineered to produce frequency-shifted, time-refracted, and reflected infrared MGWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such time interfaces can be utilized to generate large, highly localized quasistatic magnetic fields within the metasurfaces. The resulting nanoscale magnetization, supported by the residual circulating currents, persists after the departure of the time-scattered MGWs. We further demonstrate that the initial electromagnetic energy of the injected MGWs is partitioned between the time-reflected/refracted MGWs, residual motion of the free carriers, and a quasistatic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity and Self-Organization in an Exponential Dense Associative Memory Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Multi-Scale Physical Fields from Extremely Sparse Measurements with an Autoencoder-Diffusion Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements constitutes a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem, in which deterministic end-to-end mappings often break down due to intrinsic non-uniqueness and uncertainty. Rather than treating sparse reconstruction as a regression task, we recast it as a hierarchical probabilistic inference problem, where uncertainty is explicitly represented, structured, and progressively resolved. From this perspective, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing) as a general reconstruction paradigm for multi-scale physical fields under extreme data sparsity. Central to this paradigm is the introduction of an explicit intermediate representation that decomposes the original ill-posed problem into two substantially better-conditioned subproblems. First, a lightweight neural-operator-based functional autoencoder infers a coarse-scale approximation of the target field from sparse observations acting as an explicit intermediate variable. Rather than modeling multiple scales jointly, this intermediate estimate is deterministically fixed and subsequently used as the sole conditioning input to a conditional diffusion model that generates refined-scale details, yielding a cascaded inference structure with clearly separated reconstruction responsibilities. To ensure robustness under diverse sensing patterns, the diffusion model is trained using a mask-cascade strategy, which exposes it to a distribution of imperfect conditioning structures induced by extreme sparsity. During inference, measurement consistency is enforced through manifold-constrained gradients within a Bayesian posterior framework, ensuring fidelity to sparse observations while preserving data manifold coherence. This cascaded probabilistic formulation substantially alleviates ill-posedness, enabling accurate and stable reconstructions even under extreme sparsity.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to beat conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Guided by the simulations, we fabricate a microlens array sample to demonstrate that the chosen geometrical parameters are realistic and compatible with the fabrication process. A radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements. Our work is the first systematic integration of microlens design with spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays, bridging microphotonics, spintronics, and thermal imaging.</description>

      <title>Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</description>
