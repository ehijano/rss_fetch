      <title>Evolution of Interfacial Hydration Structure Induced by Ion Condensation and Correlation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial hydration structures are crucial in wide-ranging applications, including battery, colloid, lubrication etc. Multivalent ions like Mg2+ and La3+ show irreplaceable roles in these applications, which are hypothesized due to their unique interfacial hydration structures. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental supports. Here, using three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM), we provide the first observation for their interfacial hydration structures with molecular resolution. We observed the evolution of layered hydration structures at La(NO3)3 solution-mica interfaces with concentration. As concentration increases from 25 mM to 2 M, the layer number varies from 2 to 1 and back to 2, and the interlayer thickness rises from 0.25 to 0.34 nm, with hydration force increasing from 0.27+-0.07 to 1.04+-0.24 nN. Theory and molecular simulation reveal that multivalence induces concentration-dependent ion condensation and correlation effects, resulting in compositional and structural evolution within interfacial hydration structures. Additional experiments with MgCl2-mica, La(NO3)3-graphite and Al(NO3)3-mica interfaces together with literature comparison confirm the universality of this mechanism for both multivalent and monovalent ions. New factors affecting interfacial hydration structures are revealed, including concentration and solvent dielectric constant. This insight provides guidance for designing interfacial hydration structures to optimize solid-liquid-interphase for battery life extension, modulate colloid stability and develop efficient lubricants.</description>

      <title>Chemical Continuous Time Random Walks under Anomalous Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical master equation plays an important role to describe the time evolution of homogeneous chemical system. In addition to the reaction process, it is also accompanied by physical diffusion of the reactants in complex system that is generally not homogeneous, which will result in non-exponential waiting times for particle reactions and diffusion. In this paper we shall introduce a chemical continuous time random walk under anomalous diffusion model based on renewal process to describe the general reaction-diffusion process in the heterogeneous system, where the waiting times are arbitrary distributed. According to this model, we will develop the systematic stochastic theory including generalizing the chemical diffusion master equation, deriving the corresponding mass action law, and extending the Gillespie algorithm. As an example, we analyze the monomolecular $A\leftrightarrow B$ reaction-diffusion system for exponential and power-law waiting times respectively, and show the strong fractional memory effect of the concentration of the reactants on the history of the concentration in power-law case.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of the Complete Active-Space Extended Koopmans's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical accuracy of the extended Koopmans's theorem (EKT) in reproducing the full configuration interaction (FCI) and complete active-space configuration interaction (CAS-CI) ionization energies (IEs) of atomic and molecular systems calculated as the difference between the energies of N and (N - 1) electron states. In particular, we study the convergence of the EKT IEs to their exact values as the basis set and the active space sizes vary. We find that the first FCI EKT IEs approach their exact counterparts as the basis set size increases. However, increasing the basis set or the active space sizes do not always lead to more accurate CAS-CI EKT IEs. Our investigation supports the Davidson et al.'s observation [E. R. Davidson, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 155, 051102 (2021)] that the FCI EKT IEs can be systematically improved with arbitrary numerical accuracy by supplementing the basis set with diffuse functions of appropriate symmetry which allow the detached electron to travel far away from the reference system. By changing the exponent and the center of the diffuse functions, our results delineate a complex pattern for the CAS-CI EKT IE of LiH which can be important for the spectroscopic studies of small molecules.</description>

      <title>LICO: Large Language Models for In-Context Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO achieves state-of-the-art performance on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising over 20 objective functions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid approach predicts a lower binding energy for benzene on water ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a highly accurate value for the binding energy of benzene to proton-ordered crystalline water ice (XIh), as a model for interstellar ices. We compare our computed value to the latest experimental data available from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and find that our binding energy value agrees well with data obtained from binding to either crystalline or amorphous ice. Importantly, our new value is lower than that used in most astrochemical networks by about nearly half its value. We explore the impact of this revised binding energy value for both an AGB outflow and a protoplanetary disk. We find that the lower value of the binding energy predicted here compared with values used in the literature (4050 K versus 7587 K) leads to less depletion of gas-phase benzene in an AGB outflow, and leads to a shift outwards in the benzene snowline in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. Using this new value, the AGB model predicts lower abundances of benzene in the solid phase throughout the outflow. The disk model also predicts a larger reservoir of gas-phase benzene in the inner disk, which is consistent with the recent detections of benzene for the first time in protoplanetary disks with JWST.</description>

      <title>Crude Oil Displacement Enhanced by Interfacially Active Nanoparticles and Their Coupling Effect with Low-Salinity Brines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the microscopic scale to the petroleum-reservoir scale, the interfacial phenomena of the crude oil-water-rock system crucially control an immiscible flow in a porous reservoir. One of the key mechanisms is crude oil droplet displacement dynamics, which can be optimized by manipulating the oil-water interfacial tension and the three-phase contact angle by means of chemical injection. The current study primarily investigated oil displacement enhanced by interfacially active nanoparticles, namely poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) or pNIPAM, which found an acceleration of oil droplet receding rate (5.66 degree/s) and a greater degree of oil droplet dewetted (37.0 degree contact angle). This was due to a contribution from the nanoparticle-induced structural disjoining pressures between the oil-water and water-solid interfaces. The coupling effect of pNIPAM nanoparticles with low-salinity brines was examined, which revealed a discrepancy in different brine valences. Coupling with divalent CaCl2 led to much slower oil droplet receding dynamics (2.58 degree/s, and 58.7 degree contact angle) since oil-substrate bridging is formulated and promoted by the divalent cation. However, positive synergy was observed with a monovalent NaCl blend. The crude oil dewetting dynamics were enhanced (9.55 degree/s) owing to the combined salt-induced hydration and nanoparticle-induced structural forces. The contact angle was as low as 21.5 degree before eventually detaching from the substrate for a relatively short period (156 s). These findings highlight the coupling effect of nanoparticles and low-salinity brine on the dewetting of heavy crude oil. Adding nanoparticles to an optimal brine could be an option for faster and greater fluid displacement, which is not limited to oil production applications but several others, such as detergency and other forms of geological storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ultrafast dynamics initiated by a coherent superposition of core-excited states of nitrous oxide molecule. Using high-level \textit{ab-initio} methods, we show that the decoherence caused by the electronic decay and the nuclear dynamics is substantially slower than the induced ultrafast quantum beatings, allowing the system to undergo several oscillations before it dephases. We propose a proof-of-concept experiment using the harmonic up-conversion scheme available at X-ray free-electron laser facilities to trace the evolution of the created core-excited-state coherence through a time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic electronic relaxation of tetracene from its brightest singlet excited state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrafast relaxation dynamics of tetracene following UV excitation to a bright singlet state S6 has been studied with time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. With the help of high-level ab-initio multireference perturbation theory calculations, we assign photoelectron signals to intermediate dark electronic states S3, S4 and S5 as well as a to a low-lying electronic state S2. The energetic structure of these dark states has not been determined experimentally previously. The time-dependent photoelectron yields assigned to the states S6, S5 and S4 have been analyzed and reveal the depopulation of S6 within 50 fs, while S5 and S4 are populated with delays of about 50 and 80 fs. The dynamics of the lower-lying states S3 and S2 seem to agree with a delayed population coinciding with the depopulation of the higher-lying states S4-S6, but could not be elucidated in full detail due to the low signal levels of the corresponding two-photon ionization probe processes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Flame Structure and Interactions Between Chemical Reactions, Species Transport and Heat Release in Laminar Flames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel method for analyzing counterflow diffusion flames, inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural networks, is proposed to identify critical species influencing the heat release rate. By further analyzing concentration changes, this method reveals complex interactions among critical radicals across different temperature zones. To illustrate this approach, the study investigates the auto-ignition temperature of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures within a counterflow flame configuration under low strain rates. In n-heptane dominant mixtures, the inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) by additional ethanol impacts the heat release rate in the high-temperature zone through the diffusion of specific radicals such as CH2O, C2H4, C3H6, and H2O2. In ethanol-dominant mixtures, higher ethanol fractions increase the heat release rate, primarily due to ethanol decomposition and its subsequent reactions. This method effectively quantifies and compares the influence of both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects, providing detailed insights into the interactions among species across the reactive field when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>Observation of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the electron-nuclear polarization transfer process during pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be reversed on a microsecond timescale, leading to the observation of DNP echoes. The DNP echoes are induced by consecutive application of two pulse trains that produce effective Hamiltonians that differ only in the sign of the effective hyperfine coupling. The experiments have been performed on a frozen solution of trityl radicals in water/glycerol on a home-built X-band EPR/DNP spectrometer at 80 K. We envisage that DNP echoes will play an important role in future development of pulsed DNP for sensitivity-enhanced NMR, hyperfine spectroscopy, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Refining Potential Energy Surface through Dynamical Properties via Differentiable Molecular Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning potentials (MLP) largely enhances the reliability of molecular dynamics, but its accuracy is limited by the underlying $\textit{ab initio}$ methods. A viable approach to overcome this limitation is to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However, potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties, leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy) unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based MLP towards higher accuracy. Essentially, this work contributes to the solution of the inverse problem of spectroscopy by extracting microscopic interactions from vibrational spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections, the importance of which remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of molecular electronics has emerged from efforts to understand electron propagation through single molecules and to use them in electronic circuits. Serving as a testbed for advanced theoretical methods, it reveals a significant discrepancy between the operational time scales of experiments (static to GHz frequencies) and theoretical models (femtoseconds). Utilizing a recently developed time-linear nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism, we model molecular junctions on experimentally accessible timescales. Our study focuses on the quantum pump effect in a Benzenedithiol molecule connected to two copper electrodes and coupled with cavity photons. By calculating both electric and photonic current responses to an ac bias voltage, we observe pronounced electroluminescence and high harmonic generation in this setup. The mechanism of the latter effect is more analogous to that from solids than from isolated molecules, with even harmonics being suppressed or enhanced depending on the symmetry of the driving field.</description>
