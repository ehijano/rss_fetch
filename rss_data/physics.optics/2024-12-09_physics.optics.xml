      <title>Quadrupole Mie-resonant metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense lattices of photonic crystals can serve as artificial materials, with light propagation in these structures described by effective material parameters that surpass the capabilities of natural materials. In this study, we introduce a metamaterial that supports quadrupole magnetization, a characteristic rarely observed in existing structures. We experimentally demonstrate a magnetic quadrupole metamaterial associated with Mie-resonance-excited stop bands below the Bragg band. Additionally, we develop a theoretical model that addresses both dispersion and boundary conditions within this framework. Using a Fabry-Perot resonator as a case study, we validate our model and reveal that the quadrupole metamaterial can exhibit a markedly different reflection/transmission spectrum, including zero reflection at normal incidence. Our findings underscore the practical potential for both experimental and theoretical investigations of metamaterials that extend beyond the dipole approximation.</description>

      <title>Photothermal Expansion of Nanostructures in Photo-induced Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful mid-infrared illumination combined with mechanical detection via force microscopy provides access to nanoscale spectroscopic imaging in Materials and Life Sciences. Photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM) employs pulsed illumination and noncontact force microscopy resulting in unprecedented spatial and high spectral resolution. The near-field-enhanced light absorption in the materials leads to thermal expansion affecting the distance-dependent weak van der Waals (VdW) force acting between the tip and the sample. We model the non-linear impact of material characteristics and surface shape on the tip-sample interaction, the heat generation from the presence of a photo-induced electric field, the associated thermal expansion under different illumination conditions including light polarization and the feedback to the dynamic tip motion due to the expansion. Comparison of the results with our experimental investigation of a polymer nanosphere shows good agreement, contributing new insights into the understanding required for a quantitative analysis of nanostructured materials imaged using PiFM.</description>

      <title>Surface-plasmon polaritons in multilayer jellium systems: dispersion and spatial description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic waves that propagate along metal-dielectric interfaces, with important applications in sensing, energy, and nanotechnology. While the behavior of SPPs in single metal slabs is well understood, the coupling between plasmon modes in multilayer systems has received less attention. In this paper, we explore the response functions of SPPs in single-slab, double-slab, and two-different-slab systems using the jellium model. Thanks to a comparison with classical models, our study reveals how quantum effects influence the resonance frequencies of these modes. It also details the spatial description of the different SPP modes and unveils how their coupling occurs in two-different-slab systems. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of SPPs, especially in complex nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Analytical assessment of the total loss in tubular hollow-core fibers during their fabrication process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCFs) have become a key enabling technology for addressing a broad spectrum of fundamental and applied needs. Indeed, recent advancements achieved by the HCPCF research community have led to significant progress, establishing these fibers as the lowest-loss optical fibers currently available for use in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. However, the fabrication process of HCPCFs demands costly infrastructure, and achieving ultralow-loss fibers remains a complex technical challenge as numerous fabrication attempts are typically required to optimize their performances. Therefore, predicting these fibers' performances before experimental fabrication is highly desirable. In this work, we tackle this task by analytically assessing the total loss in tubular-lattice HCPCFs during their fabrication process. By considering the variation in the microstructure's geometrical parameters during fabrication and the different sources of loss, we estimate expected loss levels and identify the conditions for loss minimization. We understand that our research provides valuable insights into the fabrication process of hollow-core fibers, offering a predictive approach to evaluate the fibers' performance before their experimental realization. By determining optimal conditions considering geometry, fabrication constraints, and loss figures, we believe that our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to further reduce the loss levels in HCPCFs.</description>

      <title>Polarization faticons: Chiral localized structures in self-defocusing Kerr resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on numerical predictions and experimental observations of a novel type of temporal localized dissipative structures that manifest themselves in the self-defocusing regime of driven nonlinear optical resonators with two polarization modes. These chiral dissipative solitons, which we term polarization faticons, break both temporal and polarization symmetry and consist of two bright lobes of opposite polarization handedness, interlocked by a domain wall. Our study reveals that faticons are connected to a vectorial modulational instability, from which they can be excited through a collapsing dynamic. Faticons could offer a novel pathway for frequency comb generation in normal dispersion resonators. More generally, they offer new fundamental insights into vectorial localized dissipative structures and could be relevant to other multi-component dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the combined dynamic and geometric phases for optical vortex beam generation using metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of optical vortex beams is pivotal for a myriad of applications, encompassing optical tweezing, optical communications, and quantum information, among others. The metasurface-based approach has realized significant advancements in vortex production, utilizing either dynamic or geometric phases. The dynamic design exhibits indifference to the polarization state of incident light, while the geometric design is inextricably tied to it. In the study, we put forth the proposition that combining dynamic and geometric phases could unlock the potential of metasurface design in generating optical vortices. A hybrid design that harnesses the combined dynamic and geometric phases can attain the same objective while offering tunable functional control over the polarization of light. We establish a correlation between the structural parameters of metasurface and the topological charge of the resulting vortices. The experimental results fully demonstrate the design's flexibility and its effective control over the polarization constraints of incident light. Our research uncovers the capacity for vortex generation through the manipulation of hybrid phases introduced by metasurfaces, indicating significant potential for the design of optical devices and the future advancement of innovative optical applications.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to feedback control for Pound-Drever-Hall laser linewidth narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for laser linewidth narrowing is widely used by AMO experimentalists. However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking requires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across literature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent pedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely cover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom discuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles provide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not reader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop tuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize multifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback control principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser lock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual amplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step optimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi multispectral imaging camera system (PiMICS): a low-cost, skills-based physics educational tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an educational pilot program for low-cost physics experimentation run in Ecuador, South Africa, and the United States. The program was developed after having needs-based discussions with African educators, researchers, and leaders. It was determined that the need and desire for low-cost, skills-building, and active-learning tools is very high. From this, we developed a 3D-printable, Raspberry Pi-based multispectral camera (15 to 25 spectral channels in the visible and near-IR) for as little as $100. The program allows students to learn 3D modeling, 3D printing, feedback, control, image analysis, Python programming, systems integration and artificial intelligence as well as spectroscopy. After completing their cameras, the students in the program studied plant health, plant stress, post-harvest fruit ripeness, and polarization and spectral analysis of nanostructured insect wings, the latter of which won the ``best-applied research" award at a conference poster session and will be highlighted in this paper. Importantly, these cameras can be an integral part of any developing country's agricultural, recycling, medical, and pharmaceutical infrastructure. Thus, we believe this experiment can play an important role at the intersection of student training and developing countries' capacity building.</description>

      <title>A simple model for longitudinal electron transport during and after laser excitation: Emergence of electron resistive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous attentions over several decades, as it provides a much faster way to control electron dynamics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so how and why an electron can acquire a longitudinal velocity remains unanswered. Here we show that it is the magnetic field that steers the electron to the light propagation direction. But, quantitatively, our free-electron model is still unable to reproduce the experimental velocities. Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the system absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the experimental observation. We introduce a concept of the resistive transport, where electrons deaccelerate under a constant resistance after laser excitation. This theory finally explains why the experimental distance-versus-time forms a down-concave curve, and unifies ballistic and superdiffusive transports into a single resistive transport. We expect that our finding will motivate further investigations.</description>

      <title>Polariton-induced Purcell effects via a reduced semiclassical electrodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell--Schr\"odinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. Additionally, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach -- an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of a quantum system interacting with an environment can be described as a unitary process acting on both the system and the environment. In this framework, the system's evolution can be predicted by tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom. Here, we establish a precise mapping between the global unitary dynamics and the quantum operation involving the system, wherein the system is a single qubit, and the environment is modeled as a discrete lattice space. This approach enables the implementation of arbitrary noise operations on single-polarization qubits using a minimal set of three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, whose transverse distribution of the optic axes can be patterned to reproduce the target process. We experimentally validate this method by simulating common noise processes, such as phase errors and depolarization.</description>

      <title>Photon vortex generation from nonlinear Compton scattering in Feynman approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we show calculation of nonlinear Compton scattering with circularly polarized photons in a cylindrical coordinate using Feynman diagram to calculate photon vortex generation in intermediate states considering conservation of angular momentum. We take two different vortex wave functions based on Bessel function for the emitted photon and the electron after emission of the photon, which are the eigenstate of z component of the total angular momentum (zTAM) when a particle propagates along z axis. The result shows that when an electron absorbs N photons a photon vortex with a zTAM = N is predominantly radiated, but there are still very small contributions of photons with a zTAM = (N-1) and (N +1) due to the spin flip of the initial electron. This means even when an electron absorbs only a single photon, the electron may emit a photon vortex of a zTAM of 2 h-bar. However, the numerical calculations show that the contribution of the spin flip is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the dominant radiation. We also discuss the circular polarization for the generated photon vortices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-hydrodynamic modal perspective on plasmonic gap structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic gap structures are among the few configurations capable of generating extreme light confinement, finding applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopy, ultrasensitive detection, photocatalysis and more. Their plasmonic response undergoes a dramatic, quantum effect-driven transition as the gap size approaches zero. Modal analysis can reveal insights into the mechanisms governing this process, which are otherwise obscured by nonlocal damping effects. Here, we offer a fresh modal perspective on the transition of the plasmonic response using quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT)-based quasinormal mode (QNM) analysis. Focusing on the bonding dipolar and charge-transfer plasmons of a nanosphere dimer, we examine the detailed mode transition through the touching regime as well as the asymptotic behavior compared with the classical results as the constituent nanoparticles either separate or overlap. The complex eigenfrequency particularly provides accurate information on the linewidth and quality factor of the plasmon modes. We introduce an index to characterize charge-transfer efficiency, especially for the charge-transfer plasmon. The significant role of nonlocal damping in the mode evolution is elucidated by our mode-resolved QHT-QNM analysis. The insights from our theoretical study provide an integrated understanding of mode evolution in plasmonic gap structures, which can further advance gap structure-based applications.</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>

Abstract: In a recent publication [Opt. Express 32, 20904 (2024)], the accuracy of the main evolution equation that governs resonator dynamics in the coupled-mode theory (CMT) was questioned. The study concluded that the driving force is proportional to the temporal derivative of the excitation field rather than the excitation field itself. This conclusion was reached with a derivation of an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation obtained directly from Maxwell's equations, which was further supported by extensive numerical tests. Hereafter, we argue that the original derivation lacks mathematical rigor. We present a direct and rigorous derivation that establishes a solid mathematical foundation for the EME equation. This new approach clarifies the origin of the temporal derivative in the excitation term of CMT and elucidates the approximations present in the classical CMT evolution equation through a straightforward argument.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can actually enhance the overlap of electron and hole wave functions in III-nitride quantum wells, which are being considered for polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications. By systematically exploring the design space of AlInGaN heterostructures with machine learning, we uncover that larger electric fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emitters. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to reveal unexpected trends for informing the design of semiconductor heterostructures.</description>
