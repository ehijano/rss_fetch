      <title>When Small Acts Scale: Ethical Thresholds in Network Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much ethical evaluation treats actions dyadically: one agent acts on one recipient. In networked, platform-mediated environments, this lens misses how public acts diffuse. We introduce a minimal message-passing model in which an initiating act with baseline valence w spreads across a social graph with exposure b, per-hop salience $alpha$, compliance $q$, and depth (horizon) d. The model yields a closed-form \emph{network multiplier} relative to the dyadic baseline and identifies a threshold at r=b.alpha.q=1 separating subcritical (saturating), critical (linear), and supercritical (geometric) regimes. We show how common platform design levers -- reach and fan-out (affecting b), ranking and context (affecting alpha), share mechanics and friction (affecting q), and time-bounds (affecting d) -- systematically change expected downstream responsibility Applications include pandemic mitigation and vaccination externalities, as well as platform amplification of prosocial and harmful norms.</description>

      <title>U-centrality: A Network Centrality Measure Based on Minimum Energy Control for Laplacian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network centrality is a foundational concept for quantifying the importance of nodes within a network. Many traditional centrality measures--such as degree and betweenness centrality--are purely structural and often overlook the dynamics that unfold across the network. However, the notion of a node's importance is inherently context-dependent and must reflect both the system's dynamics and the specific objectives guiding its operation. Motivated by this perspective, we propose a dynamic, task-aware centrality framework rooted in optimal control theory. By formulating a problem on minimum energy control of average opinion based on Laplacian dynamics and focusing on the variance of terminal state, we introduce a novel centrality measure--termed U-centrality--that quantifies a node's ability to unify the agents' state. We demonstrate that U-centrality interpolates between known measures: it aligns with degree centrality in the short-time horizon and converges to a new centrality over longer time scales which is closely related to current-flow closeness centrality. This work bridges structural and dynamical approaches to centrality, offering a principled, versatile tool for network analysis in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics: A Comprehensive Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics, the evolution of individuals through social interactions, is an important area of research with applications ranging from politics to marketing. Due to its interdisciplinary relevance, studies of opinion dynamics remain fragmented across computer science, mathematics, the social sciences, and physics, and often lack shared frameworks. This survey bridges these gaps by reviewing well-known models of opinion dynamics within a unified framework and categorizing them into distinct classes based on their properties. Furthermore, the key findings on these models are covered in three parts: convergence properties, viral marketing, and user characteristics. We first analyze the final configuration (consensus vs polarized) and convergence time for each model. We then review the main algorithmic, complexity, and combinatorial results in the context of viral marketing. Finally, we explore how node characteristics, such as stubbornness, activeness, or neutrality, shape diffusion outcomes. By unifying terminology, methods, and challenges across disciplines, this paper aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress in understanding and harnessing opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Framework Based on Graph Cellular Automata for Similarity Evaluation in Urban Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring similarity in urban spatial networks is key to understanding cities as complex systems. Yet most existing methods are not tailored for spatial networks and struggle to differentiate them effectively. We propose GCA-Sim, a similarity-evaluation framework based on graph cellular automata. Each submodel measures similarity by the divergence between value distributions recorded at multiple stages of an information evolution process. We find that some propagation rules magnify differences among network signals; we call this "network resonance." With an improved differentiable logic-gate network, we learn several submodels that induce network resonance. We evaluate similarity through clustering performance on fifty city-level and fifty district-level road networks. The submodels in this framework outperform existing methods, with Silhouette scores above 0.9. Using the best submodel, we further observe that planning-led street networks are less internally homogeneous than organically grown ones; morphological categories from different domains contribute with comparable importance; and degree, as a basic topological signal, becomes increasingly aligned with land value and related variables over iterations.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Scientific Collaboration in Biomedical LLM Research: Dynamics, Institutional Participation, and Resource Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly transforming biomedical discovery and clinical innovation, yet their impact extends far beyond algorithmic revolution-LLMs are restructuring how scientific collaboration occurs, who participates, and how resources shape innovation. Despite this profound transformation, how this rapid technological shift is reshaping the structure and equity of scientific collaboration in biomedical LLM research remains largely unknown. By analyzing 5,674 LLM-related biomedical publications from PubMed, we examine how collaboration diversity evolves over time, identify institutions and disciplines that anchor and bridge collaboration networks, and assess how resource disparities underpin research performance. We find that collaboration diversity has grown steadily, with a decreasing share of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence authors, suggesting that LLMs are lowering technical barriers for biomedical investigators. Network analysis reveals central institutions, including Stanford University and Harvard Medical School, and bridging disciplines such as Medicine and Computer Science that anchor collaborations in this field. Furthermore, biomedical research resources are strongly linked to research performance, with high-performing resource-constrained institutions exhibiting larger collaboration volume with the top 1% most connected institutions in the network. Together, these findings reveal a complex landscape, where democratizing trends coexist with a persistent, resource-driven hierarchy, highlighting the critical role of strategic collaboration in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Tokenomics: How Farcaster's Pluralistic Incentives Reshape Social Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical analysis of how diverse token-based reward mechanisms impact platform dynamics and user behaviors. For this, we gather a unique, large-scale dataset from Farcaster. This blockchain-based, decentralized social network incorporates multiple incentive mechanisms spanning platform-native rewards, third-party token programs, and peer-to-peer tipping. Our dataset captures token transactions and social interactions from 574,829 wallet-linked users, representing 64.25% of the platform's user base. Our socioeconomic analyses reveal how different tokenomics design shape varying participation rates (7.6%--70%) and wealth concentration patterns (Gini 0.72--0.94), whereas inter-community tipping (51--75% of all tips) is 1.3--2x more frequent among non-following pairs, thereby mitigating echo chambers. Our causal analyses further uncover several critical trade-offs: (1) while most token rewards boost content creation, they often fail to enhance -- sometimes undermining -- content quality; (2) token rewards increase follower acquisition but show neutral or negative effects on outbound following, suggesting potential asymmetric network growth; (3) repeated algorithmic rewards demonstrate strong cumulative effects that may encourage strategic optimization. Our findings advance understanding of cryptocurrency integration in social platforms and highlight challenges in aligning economic incentives with authentic social value.</description>

      <title>Do Employee Verification Mechanisms Alter Cultural Signals in Employer Reviews?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online reviews shape impressions across products and workplaces. Employer reviews combine narratives and ratings that reflect culture. Glassdoor permits fully anonymous posts; Blind requires employment verification while preserving anonymity. We ask how verification changes reviews. Evidence suggests verified reviews can be more trustworthy, yet verification can also erode authenticity when expectations are unmet. We use the Competing Values Framework (clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, market) and the CultureBERT model by Koch and Pasch, 2023 to over 300k ratings. We find that Blind reviews emphasize clan and hierarchy while Glassdoor skews positive and highlights clan and market. Verification on its own does not remove bias but shifts how culture is represented. Job seekers using different platforms receive systematically different signals about workplace culture, affecting application decisions and job-matching.</description>

      <title>DEEP: A Discourse Evolution Engine for Predictions about Social Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous social movements (SMs) around the world help support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Understanding how key events shape SMs is key to the achievement of the SDGs. We have developed SMART (Social Media Analysis &amp; Reasoning Tool) to track social movements related to the SDGs. SMART was designed by a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers, journalists, communications scholars and legal experts. This paper describes SMART's transformer-based multivariate time series Discourse Evolution Engine for Predictions about Social Movements (DEEP) to predict the volume of future articles/posts and the emotions expressed. DEEP outputs probabilistic forecasts with uncertainty estimates, providing critical support for editorial planning and strategic decision-making. We evaluate DEEP with a case study of the #MeToo movement by creating a novel longitudinal dataset (433K Reddit posts and 121K news articles) from September 2024 to June 2025 that will be publicly released for research purposes upon publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network for Node Importance Ranking in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node importance ranking is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. Existing approaches typically rely on node features derived from either traditional centrality measures or advanced graph representation learning methods, which depend directly on the target network's topology. However, this reliance on structural information raises privacy concerns and often leads to poor generalization across different networks. In this work, we address a key question: Can we design a node importance ranking model trained exclusively on synthetic networks that is effectively appliable to real-world networks, eliminating the need to rely on the topology of target networks and improving both practicality and generalizability? We answer this question affirmatively by proposing the Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN), a novel framework that leverages causal representation learning to get robust, invariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Firstly, ICAN introduces an influence-aware causal representation learning module within an autoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related to node importance. Moreover, we introduce a causal ranking loss and design a unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and ranking objectives, enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation learning and ranking optimization. This design allows ICAN, trained on synthetic networks, to generalize effectively across diverse real-world graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking accuracy and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Polarization and echo chambers in Reddit's political discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political debate nowadays takes place mainly on online social media, with election periods amplifying ideological engagement. Reddit is generally considered more resistant to polarization and echo chamber effects than platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Here, we challenge this assumption through a case study across the 2016 US presidential election. We use statistical validation techniques to extract ideologically distinct communities of subreddits, in terms of their contributing user base and news consumption, which we use to analyze the dynamics of political debate. We thus reveal clear polarization in both interaction-based and topic-based communities, with clusters of Democratic, Conservative, and Banned subreddits. Election periods intensify cross-group engagement, align Banned and Conservative content, and reduce linguistic diversity within groups. Overall we characterize Reddit as a polarized environment marked by the presence of echo chambers, highlighting network validation as a key method for identifying behavioral and interaction patterns on online social media.</description>

      <title>Z-Dip: a validated generalization of the Dip Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting multimodality in empirical distributions is a fundamental problem in statistics and data analysis, with applications ranging from clustering to social science. Hartigan's Dip Test is a classical nonparametric procedure for testing unimodality versus multimodality, but its interpretation is hindered by strong dependence on sample size and the need for lookup tables. We introduce the Z-Dip, a standardized extension of the Dip Test that removes sample-size dependence by comparing observed Dip values to simulated null distributions. We calibrate a universal decision threshold for Z-Dip via simulation and bootstrap resampling, providing a unified criterion for multimodality detection. In the final section, we also propose a downsampling-based approach to further mitigate residual sample-size effects in very large datasets. Lookup tables and software implementations are made available for efficient use in practice.</description>

      <title>Effective Community Detection Over Streaming Bipartite Networks (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The streaming bipartite graph is widely used to model the dynamic relationship between two types of entities in various real-world applications, including movie recommendations, location-based services, and online shopping. Since it contains abundant information, discovering the dense subgraph with high structural cohesiveness (i.e., community detection) in the bipartite streaming graph is becoming a valuable problem. Inspired by this, in this paper, we study the structure of the community on the butterfly motif in the bipartite graph. We propose a novel problem, named Community Detection over Streaming Bipartite Network (CD-SBN), which aims to retrieve qualified communities with user-specific query keywords and high structural cohesiveness at snapshot and continuous scenarios. In particular, we formulate the user relationship score in the weighted bipartite network via the butterfly pattern and define a novel $(k,r,\sigma)$-bitruss as the community structure. To efficiently tackle the CD-SBN problem, we design effective pruning strategies to rule out false alarms of $(k,r,\sigma)$-bitruss and propose a hierarchical synopsis to facilitate the CD-SBN processing. We develop efficient algorithms to answer snapshot and continuous CD-SBN queries by traversing the synopsis and applying pruning strategies. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our CD-SBN approach on real/synthetic streaming bipartite networks.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Sociodemographic Fabric of Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the sociodemographic composition of online platforms is essential for accurately interpreting digital behavior and its societal implications. Yet, current methods often lack the transparency and reliability required, risking misrepresenting social identities and distorting our understanding of digital society. Here, we introduce a principled framework for sociodemographic inference on Reddit that leverages over 850,000 user self-declarations of age, gender, and partisan affiliation. By training models on sparse user activity signals from this extensive, self-disclosed dataset, we demonstrate that simple probabilistic models, such as Naive Bayes, outperform more complex embedding-based alternatives. Our approach improves classification performance over the state of the art by up to 19% in ROC AUC and maintains quantification error below 15%. The models produce well-calibrated and interpretable outputs, enabling uncertainty estimation and subreddit-level feature importance analysis. More broadly, this work advocates for a shift toward more ethical and transparent computational social science by grounding sociodemographic analysis in user-provided data rather than researcher assumptions.</description>

      <title>H-NeiFi: Non-Invasive and Consensus-Efficient Multi-Agent Opinion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility in Epidemic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce "truthful" entries via the large language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 1,800 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia, drawn from the 2,000 most-edited Wikipedia pages. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and greater structural variability. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia's informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.</description>
