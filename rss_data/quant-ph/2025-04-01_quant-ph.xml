      <title>Multiple Embeddings for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the limitations about the insufficient fitting capability of current quantum machine learning methods, which results from the over-reliance on a single data embedding strategy. We propose a novel quantum machine learning framework that integrates multiple quantum data embedding strategies, allowing the model to fully exploit the diversity of quantum computing when processing various datasets. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods and achieving superior performance in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Definitive Proof of the Classical Multiverse!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent astonishing experiments with quantum computers have demonstrated unambiguously the existence of a quantum multiverse, where calculations of mind-boggling complexity are effortlessly computed in just a few minutes. Here, we investigate whether a similar computation on a digital computer can demonstrate the existence of a classical multiverse. To this end we describe a classical algorithm for efficiently sampling from a $d^n$-dimensional discrete probability distribution representing $n$ digits of $d$ possible values with strong statistical dependence. Although the full distribution for large $n$ quickly becomes intractable, probabilities for given samples can be computed quite efficiently. This allows us to compute exact empirical linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) values. Results on a low-end laptop for $d=2$ show excellent agreement with the true XEB for $n \le 30$ and large positive values of the exact empirical XEB for $n \le 1023$ computed over one million samples. We conclude that classical, as well as quantum, computation occurs in many parallel universes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of multi-objective optimization is to understand optimal trade-offs between competing objective functions by finding the Pareto front, i.e., the set of all Pareto optimal solutions, where no objective can be improved without degrading another one. Multi-objective optimization can be challenging classically, even if the corresponding single-objective optimization problems are efficiently solvable. Thus, multi-objective optimization represents a compelling problem class to analyze with quantum computers. In this work, we use low-depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to approximate the optimal Pareto front of certain multi-objective weighted maximum cut problems. We demonstrate its performance on an IBM Quantum computer, as well as with Matrix Product State numerical simulation, and show its potential to outperform classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Excited State Relaxation Dynamics of Boron-Vacancy Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental identification of optically addressable spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride has opened new possibilities for quantum sensor technologies in two-dimensional materials and structures. Despite numerous fundamental and theoretical studies on the electronic structure of defects, the dynamics of the excited states are yet to be comprehensively investigated. The non-radiative relaxation pathways from the triplet excited states to the triplet ground states, particularly the one via a metastable intermediate state, remain largely presumed. A detailed identification, let alone a direct measurement of the rate constants, is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of the excited and intermediate states in the optical cycle under pulsed laser excitation in a broad temperature range. The focus is on the shelving intermediate state and resulting ground state spin polarization of an ensemble of optically pumped negatively charged boron vacancies. Our experiments show a relaxation time of 24 ns from the metastable state back to the ground state at room temperature. For low temperatures we find this time to approximately double - in accordance with a doubling of photoluminescence lifetime and intensity. Simulations show the evolution of the spin-populations in the five-level system and the polarization of the ground state depending on excitation rates. We thus optimize pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance sequences to account for the relaxation of the intermediate state. This yields significantly increased efficiency of the spin manipulation and hence, the sensitivity of the quantum sensor based on boron vacancies can be optimized considerably.</description>

      <title>Errors in quantum state identification with ultrashort pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the nonclassicality of photon superbunching to the basic property of intensity, we characterize light with correlation and coherence functions. The correlation functions for nonstationary sources, such as short pulses, depend deterministically on the time dependent shape of the field and change the probability of the ensemble in time. We start from the fundamental principles of detection and show how nonstationary fields result in a coherence function that depends not only on the statistics of the field but also on the field shape. This means that observations of bunching and superbunching with ultrafast sources are not indicative of the quantum state of the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Doeblin Coefficients: Interpretations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the Doeblin coefficient of a classical channel provides an efficiently computable upper bound on the total-variation contraction coefficient of the channel, leading to what is known as a strong data-processing inequality. Here, we investigate quantum Doeblin coefficients as a generalization of the classical concept. In particular, we define various new quantum Doeblin coefficients, one of which has several desirable properties, including concatenation and multiplicativity, in addition to being efficiently computable. We also develop various interpretations of two of the quantum Doeblin coefficients, including representations as minimal singlet fractions, exclusion values, reverse max-mutual and oveloH informations, reverse robustnesses, and hypothesis testing reverse mutual and oveloH informations. Our interpretations of quantum Doeblin coefficients as either entanglement-assisted or unassisted exclusion values are particularly appealing, indicating that they are proportional to the best possible error probabilities one could achieve in state-exclusion tasks by making use of the channel. We also outline various applications of quantum Doeblin coefficients, ranging from limitations on quantum machine learning algorithms that use parameterized quantum circuits (noise-induced barren plateaus), on error mitigation protocols, on the sample complexity of noisy quantum hypothesis testing, on the fairness of noisy quantum models, and on mixing times of time-varying channels. All of these applications make use of the fact that quantum Doeblin coefficients appear in upper bounds on various trace-distance contraction coefficients of a channel. Furthermore, in all of these applications, our analysis using Doeblin coefficients provides improvements of various kinds over contributions from prior literature, both in terms of generality and being efficiently computable.</description>

      <title>Theory of the correlated quantum Zeno effect in a monitored qubit dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the stochastic dynamics of two qubits subject to one- and two-site correlated continuous weak measurements. When measurements dominate over the local unitary evolution, the system's dynamics is constrained and part of the physical Hilbert space becomes inaccessible: a typical signature of the Quantum Zeno (QZ) effect. In this work, we show how the competition between these two measurement processes give rise to two distinct QZ regimes, we dubbed standard and correlated, characterised by a different topology of the allowed region of the physical Hilbert space being a simply and non-simply connected domain, respectively. We develop a theory based on a stochastic Gutzwiller ansatz for the wavefunction that is able to capture the structure of the phase diagram. Finally we show how the two QZ regimes are intimately connected to the topology of the flow of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the no-click evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamic of position-dependent mass system confined in harmonic
  oscillator potential. We derive the eigensystems by solving the Schr\''odinger-like equation which
  describes this system. We construct coherent states a Gazeau-Klauder for this system. We
  show that these states satisfy the Klauder's mathematical condition to build coherent states. We
  compute and analyse some statistical properties of these states. We find that these states exhibit
  sub-Poissonian statistics. We also evaluate quasiprobability distributions such as the Wigner
  function to demonstrate graphically nonclassical features of these states.</description>

      <title>Local unitary classification of sets of generalized Bell states in $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two sets of quantum entangled states that are equivalent under local unitary transformations may exhibit identical effectiveness and versatility in various quantum information processing tasks. Consequently, classification under local unitary transformations has become a fundamental issue in the theory of quantum entanglement. The primary objective of this work is to establish a complete LU-classification of all sets of generalized Bell states (GBSs) in bipartite quantum systems $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$ with $d\geq 3$. Based on this classification, we determine the minimal cardinality of indistinguishable GBS sets in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{6}$ under one-way local operations and classical communication (one-way LOCC). We propose first two classification methods based on LU-equivalence for all $l$-GBS sets for $l\geq 2$. We then establish LU-classification for all 2-GBS, 3-GBS, 4-GBS and 5-GBS sets in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{6}$. Since LU-equivalent sets share identical local distinguishability, it suffices to examine representative GBS sets from equivalent classes. Notably, we identify a one-way LOCC indistinguishable 4-GBS set among these representatives, thereby resolving the case of $d = 6$ for the problem of determining the minimum cardinality of one-way LOCC indistinguishable GBS sets in [Quant. Info. Proc. 18, 145 (2019)] or [Phys. Rev. A 91, 012329 (2015)].</description>

      <title>Boosting classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling nonlinear processes is crucial for engineering light-matter interaction and generating non-classical light. A significant challenge in ultra-thin nonlinear materials is the marked diminution of the nonlinear conversion efficiency due to the reduced light-matter interaction length and, in many cases, the centrosymmetric crystalline structures. Here we relax these limitations and report a giant boost of classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials. Specifically, with a metal-nonlinear material heterostructure we enhance classical second-harmonic generation in h-BN flakes by two-orders of magnitude. Moreover, we have engineered a metal-SiO2-nonlinear material heterostructure resulting in a remarkable two orders of magnitude augmentation of the quantum spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in NbOCl2 flakes. Notably, we demonstrate SPDC in a 16 nm-thick NbOCl2 flake integrated into the proposed structure. These findings simplify on-chip quantum state engineering and accelerate the use of van der Waals materials in nonlinear optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>A Novel Transfer Matrix Framework for Multiple Dirac Delta Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical framework for studying quantum tunneling through multiple Dirac delta potential barriers in one dimension. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive a closed-form expression for the total transfer matrix of a system composed of $N$ equally spaced delta barriers. In a systematic manner, a compact expression is obtained for the first element of the transfer matrix, based on triangular numbers. This, in turn, allows us to compute the transmission coefficient exactly as a function of the number of barriers. The proposed method successfully reproduces well-known results for one and two barriers and efficiently captures complex interference effects for larger values of $N$, such as $N=4$.</description>

      <title>Bridging General Relativity and Quantum Dynamics Through Finite-Resource Logical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical framework bridging General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Dynamics (QD) is introduced through the application of Kripke semantics and linear logic. While conventional unification efforts often rely on structural or geometrical formulations, we instead treat causality, energy and information as finite, non-replicable resources constraining physical transitions and inference. Our framework, termed Energy Constrained Linear Causality (ECLC), models quantum transitions and spacetime evolution as logically constrained processes in which each implication spends limited resources and cannot be arbitrarily duplicated or reversed. We construct a causal inference model where physical operations like quantum measurement, entanglement propagation and spacetime curvature are expressed as energy-weighted, one-time transformations. Kripke semantics formalizes the logical accessibility of physical states, capturing context-sensitive transitions and the irreversibility of information flow under finite conditions. We derive a structured method for modelling observer-dependent outcomes without invoking background-independence or high-dimensional embeddings. We formulate a series of testable predictions with controlled deviations from standard GR and QD expectations. The consumption-based irreversibility introduces an intrinsic mechanism of symmetry breaking. In GR, it restricts mutual causal accessibility by bounding inference depth with curvature-weighted energy costs. In QD, it disrupts the reciprocity of conditional probabilities and undermines time symmetry in measurement sequences. Therefore, ECLC provides a unified, resource-aware logic for describing causality, computation and emergence within a finite physical universe.</description>

      <title>Symmetric and Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Jaynes-Cummings model with single-photon cavity radiation field but with the atomic system instead of exchanging a single photon as in the Jaynes-Cummings model, it exchanges instead a squeezed photon. After a unitary transformation and requiring the decoupling of the spin up from the spin down, we diagonalize the resulting Hamiltonian via a Bogoliubov transformation. This allows to determine the energy eigenvalues for the quantum Rabi model. We obtain the energy eigenvalues albeit for the asymmetric Rabi model in the limit of large coupling strength, where it approaches the symmetric Rabi model energy eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Enhancing mechanical entanglement in molecular optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for enhancing bipartite quantum entanglement in a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system incorporating an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Utilizing a set of linearized quantum Langevin equations and numerical simulations, we investigate the impact of the OPA on both optical-vibration and vibration-vibration entanglement. Our key findings reveal a counterintuitive trade-off: while the OPA significantly enhances vibration-vibration entanglement, a critical resource for quantum memories and transducers, it simultaneously suppresses optical-vibration entanglement. We demonstrate that maximal vibration-vibration entanglement is achieved when the molecular collective vibrational modes are symmetrically populated, providing a clear experimental guideline for optimizing entanglement sources. In particular, the vibration-vibration entanglement generated in our OPA-enhanced McOM system exhibits remarkable robustness to thermal noise, persisting at temperatures approaching \SI{e3}{\kelvin}, significantly exceeding conventional optomechanical systems, and highlighting the potential for room temperature quantum information processing. These results establish a promising theoretical foundation for OPA-enhanced McOM systems as a robust and scalable platform for quantum technologies, paving the way for future experimental implementations and advanced quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Quantum CSP Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any perfect quantum strategy for the two-prover game encoding a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be simulated via a perfect classical strategy with an extra classical communication channel, whose size depends only on $(i)$ the size of the shared quantum system used in the quantum strategy, and $(ii)$ structural parameters of the CSP template. The result is obtained via a combinatorial characterisation of perfect classical strategies with extra communication channels and a geometric rounding procedure for the projection-valued measurements involved in quantum strategies. A key intermediate step of our proof is to establish that the gap between the classical chromatic number of graphs and its quantum variant is bounded when the quantum strategy involves shared quantum information of bounded size.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Chromatic Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest known gap between quantum and classical chromatic number of graphs, obtained via quantum protocols for colouring Hadamard graphs based on the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Fourier transform, is exponential. We put forth a quantum pseudo-telepathy version of Khot's $d$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture and prove that, conditional to its validity, the gap is unbounded: There exist graphs whose quantum chromatic number is $3$ and whose classical chromatic number is arbitrarily large. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a certain form of pseudo-telepathic XOR games would imply the conjecture and, thus, the unboundedness of the quantum chromatic gap. As two technical steps of our proof that might be of independent interest, we establish a quantum adjunction theorem for Pultr functors between categories of relational structures, and we prove that the Dinur--Khot--Kindler--Minzer--Safra reduction, recently used for proving the $2$-to-$2$ Games Theorem, is quantum complete.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Multiplicativity in the Geometric Measure of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric measure of entanglement (GME) quantifies how close a multi-partite quantum state is to the set of separable states under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The GME can be non-multiplicative, meaning that the closest product state to two states is entangled across subsystems. In this work, we explore the GME in two families of states: those that are invariant under bilateral orthogonal $(O \otimes O)$ transformations, and mixtures of singlet states. In both cases, a region of GME non-multiplicativity is identified around the anti-symmetric projector state. We employ state-of-the-art numerical optimization methods and models to quantitatively analyze non-multiplicativity in these states for d = 3. We also investigate a constrained form of GME that measures closeness to the set of real product states and show that this measure can be non-multiplicative even for real separable states.</description>

      <title>Genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality in the curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Bell nonlocality plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this paper, we first obtain the quantitative analytical expression of the genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality of any 4-qubit quantum state. Then, we investigate and derive the genuine four-partite nonlocalities in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole and the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In the Schwarzschild black hole, it is shown that the Hawking effect destroys the accessible genuine four-partite nonlocality while simultaneously having both detrimental and beneficial impacts on the inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality. Besides, we observe that the Hawking effect can generate the physically inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality for fermion fields in Schwarzschild black hole. This result shows that the genuine four-partite nonlocality can pass through the event horizon of black hole. Moreover, we also investigate the influence of the Hawking effect of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime on the genuine four-partite nonlocality of massless Dirac fields.</description>

      <title>Probing the localization effects in Krylov basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity (K-complexity) is a measure of quantum state complexity that minimizes wavefunction spreading across all the possible bases. It serves as a key indicator of operator growth and quantum chaos. In this work, K-complexity and Arnoldi coefficients are applied to probe a variety of localization phenomena in the quantum kicked rotor system. We analyze four distinct localization scenarios -- ranging from compact localization effect arising from quantum anti-resonance to a weaker form of power-law localization -- each one exhibiting distinct K-complexity signatures and Arnoldi coefficient variations. In general, K-complexity not only indicates the degree of localization, but surprisingly also of the nature of localization. In particular, the long-time behaviour of K-complexity and the wavefunction evolution on Krylov chain can distinguish various types of observed localization in QKR. In particular, the time-averaged K-complexity and scaling of the variance of Arnoldi coefficients with effective Planck's constant can distinguish the localization effects induced by the classical regular phase structures and the dynamical localization arising from quantum interferences. Further, the Arnoldi coefficient is shown to capture the transition from integrability to chaos as well. This work shows how localization dynamics manifests in the Krylov basis.</description>

      <title>Quasi-cyclic Linear Error-Block Code-based Post-quantum Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shor algorithm led to the discovery of multiple vulnerabilities in a number of cryptosystems. As a result, post-quantum cryptography attempts to provide cryptographic solutions that can face these attacks, ensuring the security of sensitive data in a future where quantum computers are assumed to exist. Error correcting codes are a source for efficiency when it comes to signatures, especially random ones described in this paper, being quantum-resistant and reaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, thus offering a good trade-off between rate and distance. In the light of this discussion, we introduce a signature based on a family of linear error-block codes (LEB), with strong algebraic properties: it is the family of quasi-cyclic LEB codes that we do define algebraically during this work.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Machine Learning Models for Enhanced Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Towards practical non-Markovianity measures: Normalization and regularization techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measures characterizing the non-Markovianity degree of the quantum dynamics have several drawbacks when applied to real devices. They depend on the chosen measurement time interval and are highly sensitive to experimental noise and errors. We propose several techniques to enhance the practical applicability of the measures and verify our findings experimentally on a superconducting transmon and a trapped-ion qubit. The time dependence can be disregarded by introduction of the measure per oscillation, while the sensitivity to noise is reduced by applying a regularization procedure. The results for both types of qubits are compared with theoretical predictions for a simple model of non-Markovianity based on qubit-qubit interaction.</description>

      <title>Entanglement detection with quantum support vector machine(QSVM) on near-term quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying quantum entanglement remain significant challenges in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. This study presents the implementation of quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) on IBM quantum devices to identify and classify entangled states. By employing quantum variational circuits, the proposed framework achieves a runtime complexity of $O(\frac{N t}{\epsilon^2})$, where $N$ is the number of qubits, $t$ is the number of iterations, and $\epsilon$ is the acceptable error margin. We investigate various quantum circuits with multiple blocks and obtain the accuracy of QSVM as measures of expressibility and entangling capability. Our results demonstrate that the QSVM framework achieves over 90\% accuracy in distinguishing entangled states, despite hardware noise such as decoherence and gate errors. Benchmarks across superconducting qubit platforms (e.g., IBM Perth, Lagos, and Nairobi) highlight the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the QSVM framework effectively classifies two-qubit states and extends its predictive capabilities to three-qubit entangled states. This work marks a significant advancement in quantum machine learning for entanglement detection.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of non-trivial dissipative spin chains via stochastic unraveling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new technique for efficiently simulating (in polynomial time) a wide class of one-dimensional dissipative spin chains, despite the fact that these models cannot be mapped to quadratic fermionic master equations. We show that many such Lindblad master equations admit an exact stochastic unraveling with individual trajectories evolving as Gaussian fermionic states, even though the full master equation describes interacting fermions. This allows one to calculate arbitrary observables efficiently without sign problems, and with bounded sampling complexity. We utilize this new technique to study three paradigmatic dissipative effects: the melting of anti-ferromagnetic order in the presence of local loss, many-body subradiant phenomenon in systems with correlated loss, and non-equilibrium steady states of a 1D dissipative transverse-field Ising model. Beyond simply providing a powerful numerical technique, our method can also be used to gain both qualitative and quantitative insights into the role of interactions in these models.</description>

      <title>Robust Self-testing for Synchronous Correlations and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an abstract operator-algebraic characterization of robust self-testing for synchronous correlations and games. Specifically, we show that a synchronous correlation is a robust self-test if and only if there is a unique state on an appropriate $C^*$-algebra that "implements" the correlation. Extending this result, we prove that a synchronous game is a robust self-test if and only if its associated $C^*$-algebra admits a unique amenable tracial state. This framework allows us to establish that all synchronous correlations and games that serve as commuting operator self-tests for finite-dimensional strategies are also robust self-tests. As an application, we recover sufficient conditions for linear constraint system games to exhibit robust self-testing. We also demonstrate the existence of a synchronous nonlocal game that is a robust self-test but not a commuting operator self-test, showing that these notions are not equivalent.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the symmetric subspace of qubit chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric subspace of multi-qubit systems, that is, the space of states invariant under permutations, is commonly encountered in applications in the context of quantum information and communication theory. It is known that the symmetric subspace can be described in terms of irreducible representations of the group $SU(2)$, whose representation spaces form a basis of symmetric states, the so-called Dicke states. In this work, we present deformations of the symmetric subspace as deformations of this group structure, which are promoted to a quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$. We see that deformations of the symmetric subspace obtained in this manner correspond to local deformations of the inner product of each spin, in such a way that departure from symmetry can be encoded in a position-dependent inner product. The consequences and possible extensions of these results are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of quantum logic in cryogenic quantum computers requires continuous energy supply from room-temperature control electronics. This dependence on external energy sources limits scalability due to control channel density and heat dissipation. Despite the need for energy-efficient alternatives, practical solutions remain elusive. Here, we suggest quantum batteries as an intrinsic energy source for quantum computation that facilitates all unitary logic. Unlike classical power sources, a quantum battery maintains quantum coherence with its load, a property explored theoretically, though without concrete implementation in quantum technologies. We introduce a shared bosonic mode as a quantum battery that supplies energy for all unitary gates and enables all-to-all qubit connectivity. We find that initializing the battery in a Fock state allows a universal quantum gate set with a single controlling parameter per qubit - the qubits resonant frequency. When tuned to resonance, the battery facilitates energy-transfer (XY) gates, showing the quantum battery superextensive hallmarks where increasing the number of qubits reduces charging gate times and enhances their fidelities. Additionally, the quantum battery plays an active role in the computation, enabling multi-qubit parity probing with a single entangling gate. As a topical example, we simulate quantum error correction logical state encoding with fidelity above 0.98. By eliminating the need for a drive line for each qubit, this architecture reduces energy consumption to readout-only and increases the potential number of qubits per cryogenic system by a factor of four once superconducting control lines become available. Quantum batteries thus offer a transformative paradigm for scalable and energy-efficient approach to next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Predicting the von Neumann Entanglement Entropy Using a Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the von Neumann entanglement entropy from experimental data is challenging due to its dependence on the complete wavefunction, forcing reliance on approximations like classical mutual information (MI). We propose a machine learning approach using a graph neural network for predicting the von Neumann entropy from experimentally accessible bitstrings. We tested this approach on a Rydberg ladder system and achieved a mean absolute error of $3.7 \times 10^{-3}$ when testing it inside of its training range on a dataset with entropy ranging from 0 to 1.9, we also evaluated the mean absolute percentage error on the data that have its entropy larger than 0.01 of the maximum entropy(so we can avoid the areas of our phase space with near zero entropy) and got a relative error of 1.72%, outperforming MI-based bounds. When tested beyond this range, the model still delivers reasonable results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine tuning the model with a small dataset significantly improves its performance on data outside its original training range.</description>

      <title>Quantum Features of the Thermal Two-Qubit Quantum Rabi Model in Ultra- and Deep-Strong Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of long-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.</description>

      <title>Undecidable problems associated with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), are widely studied as candidates for near-term quantum advantage. Recent work has shown that training VQAs is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we present a conditional result suggesting that the training of VQAs is undecidable, even in idealized, noiseless settings. We reduce the decision version of the digitized VQA training problem-where circuit parameters are drawn from a discrete set-to the question of whether a universal Diophantine equation (UDE) has a root. This reduction relies on encoding the UDE into the structure of a variational quantum circuit via the matrix exponentials. The central step involves establishing a correspondence between the objective function of the VQA and a known UDE of 58 variables and degree 4. Our main result is conditional on a natural conjecture: that a certain system of structured complex polynomial equations-arising from the inner product of a VQA circuit output and a fixed observable-has at least one solution. We argue this conjecture is plausible based on dimension-counting arguments (degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonians, state vector, and observable), and the generic solvability of such systems in algebraic geometry over the complex numbers. Under this assumption, we suggest that deciding whether a digitized VQA achieves a given energy threshold is undecidable. This links the limitations of variational quantum algorithms to foundational questions in mathematics and logic, extending the known landscape of quantum computational hardness to include uncomputability. Additionally, we establish an unconditional undecidability result for VQA convergence in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid neon has emerged as a pristine material host for electron qubits. Single electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown extraordinarily long coherence times and high operation fidelities. Realizing two-qubit gates in this platform is the next major step for realistic quantum information processing. In this work, we demonstrate frequency- and time-domain coherent manipulation of multiple eNe charge qubits that are coupled by short-range charge interactions. Cross-resonance and bSWAP two-qubit gates are implemented, laying the foundation for universal quantum computing. An inter-qubit coupling strength exceeding 60~MHz has been observed, promising fast gate speed and suppressed infidelity. These results highlight the potential to scale up the eNe qubit platform toward universal quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Float Lattice Gas Automata: A connection between Molecular Dynamics and Lattice Boltzmann Method for quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the Integer Lattice Gas Automata framework of Blommel \textit{et al.} \cite{PhysRevE.97.023310}, we introduce a simplified, fluctuation-free variant. This approach relies on floating-point numbers and closely mirrors the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), with the key distinction being a novel collision operator. This operator, derived from the ensemble average of transition probabilities, generates nonlinear terms. We propose this new Float Lattice Gas Automata (FLGA) collision as a computationally efficient alternative to traditional and quantum LBM implementations.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum-dot-lithium-niobate hybrid integrated photonic circuits enabling on-chip quantum networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid integrated quantum photonics combines solid-state artificial atoms with reconfigurable photonic circuits, enabling scalable chip-based quantum networks. Self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) are ideal for this goal due to their ability to generate highly indistinguishable single photons with exceptional brightness. Integrating QDs into low-loss photonic circuits can facilitate complex quantum networks by enabling entanglement transfer via two-photon interference. However, challenges such as limited scalability, spectral inhomogeneity, and quantum interference between independent sources remain. We present a hybrid photonic architecture that integrates QD-containing waveguides with low-loss lithium niobate (LN) circuits, incorporating 20 deterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). Using the piezoelectric properties of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), we achieve on-chip local spectral tuning of QD emissions by up to 7.7 meV,three orders of magnitude greater than the transform-limited linewidth. This approach enables on-chip quantum interference with a visibility of 0.73 between two spatially separated QD SPSs connected by 0.48 mm long waveguides, establishing a functional quantum network.The large-scale integration of spectrally tunable QD-based SPSs into low-loss LN circuits, combined with fast electro-optical switching, paves the way for compact, lightweight, and scalable photonic quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between strict positivity of the Kossakowski matrix, irreducibility and positivity improvement properties of Markovian Quantum Dynamics. We show that for a Gaussian quantum dynamical semigroup strict positivity of the Kossakowski matrix implies irreducibility and, with an additional technical assumption, that the support of any initial state is the whole space for any positive time.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based dequantization of variational QML without Random Fourier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently a huge effort to understand the potential and limitations of variational quantum machine learning (QML) based on the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits. Recent proposals toward dequantizing variational QML models for regression problems include approaches based on kernel methods with carefully chosen kernel functions, approximated via Random Fourier Features (RFF). In this short note we show that for a wide range of instances, this approach can be simplified. More specifically, we show that the kernels whose evaluation is approximated by RFF in this dequantization algorithm can in fact often be evaluated exactly and efficiently classically. As such, our results enhance the toolkit for kernel-based dequantization of variational QML.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Shor algorithm for discrete logarithm problems with comprehensive pairs of modulo p and order q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over finite fields, commonly used in classical cryptography, has no known polynomial-time algorithm on classical computers. However, Shor has provided its polynomial-time algorithm on quantum computers. Nevertheless, there are only few examples simulating quantum circuits that operate on general pairs of modulo $p$ and order $q$. In this paper, we constructed such quantum circuits and solved DLPs for all 1,860 possible pairs of $p$ and $q$ up to 32 qubits using a quantum simulator with PRIMEHPC FX700. From this, we obtained and verified values of the success probabilities, which had previously been heuristically analyzed by Eker\r{a}. As a result, we found that the success probability of Shor's algorithm for solving the DLP exhibits periodicity with an asymmetric waveform determined by the order $q$. Additionally, we generated 1,015 quantum circuits for larger pairs of $p$ and $q$, extrapolated the circuit sizes obtained, and compared them for $p=2048$ bits between safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups. While in classical cryptography, the cipher strength of safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups is the same if $p$ is equal, we quantitatively demonstrated how much the strength of the latter decreases to the bit length of $p$ in the former when using Shor's quantum algorithm. In particular, it was experimentally and theoretically shown that when a ripple carry adder is used in the addition circuit, the cryptographic strength of a Schnorr group with $p=2048$ bits under Shor's algorithm is almost equivalent to that of a safe-prime group with $p=1024$ bits.</description>

      <title>Choco-Q: Commute Hamiltonian-based QAOA for Constrained Binary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained binary optimization aims to find an optimal assignment to minimize or maximize the objective meanwhile satisfying the constraints, which is a representative NP problem in various domains, including transportation, scheduling, and economy. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) provide a promising methodology for solving this problem by exploiting the parallelism of quantum entanglement. However, existing QAOA approaches based on penalty-term or Hamiltonian simulation fail to thoroughly encode the constraints, leading to extremely low success rate and long searching latency.
  This paper proposes Choco-Q, a formal and universal framework for constrained binary optimization problems, which comprehensively covers all constraints and exhibits high deployability for current quantum devices. The main innovation of Choco-Q is to embed the commute Hamiltonian as the driver Hamiltonian, resulting in a much more general encoding formulation that can deal with arbitrary linear constraints. Leveraging the arithmetic features of commute Hamiltonian, we propose three optimization techniques to squeeze the overall circuit complexity, including Hamiltonian serialization, equivalent decomposition, and variable elimination. The serialization mechanism transforms the original Hamiltonian into smaller ones. Our decomposition methods only take linear time complexity, achieving end-to-end acceleration. Experiments demonstrate that Choco-Q shows more than 235$\times$ algorithmic improvement in successfully finding the optimal solution, and achieves 4.69$\times$ end-to-end acceleration, compared to prior QAOA designs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-computing within a bosonic context: Assessing finite basis effects on prototypical vibrational Hamiltonian spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has recently been emerging in theoretical chemistry as a realistic avenue meant to offer computational speedup to challenging eigenproblems in the context of strongly-correlated molecular systems or extended materials. Most studies so far have been devoted to the quantum treatment of electronic structure and only a few were directed to the quantum treatment of vibrational structure, which at the moment remains not devoid of unknowns. In particular, we address here a formal problem that arises when simulating a vibrational model under harmonic second quantization, whereby the disruption of the closure relation (resolution of the identity) -- which occurs when truncating the infinite bosonic basis set -- may have some serious effects as regards the correct evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements. This relates intimately to the normal ordering of products of ladder operators. In addition, we discuss the relevance of choosing an adequate primitive basis set within the present context with respect to its variational convergence properties. Such fundamental, yet consequential, aspects are illustrated numerically in the present work on a one-dimensional anharmonic Hamiltonian model corresponding to a double-well potential showing strong tunneling, of interest both for vibrational spectroscopy and chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Coherent microwave control of coupled electron-muon centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control by means of tailored excitation is a key to versatile experimental schemes for spectroscopic investigation and technological utilization of quantum systems. Here we study a quantum system which consists of a coupled electron-moun spin state, i.e., muonium, a light isotope of hydrogen. We demonstrate the most fundamental coherent control techniques by microwave excitation of spin transitions, namely driven Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes upon free evolution. Unprecedented performance is achieved by the microwave hardware devised for these experiments, which enables coherent spin manipulation of individual, isolated, muonium centers. For muonium formed in SiO$_2$ with strong electron-muon hyperfine interaction, a virtually undamped free precession signal is observed up to a 3.5 $\mu$s time window. For muonium formed in Si with weak and anisotropic hyperfine interaction, a strong drive at the multi-quantum transition decouples the muonium center from its magnetic environment formed by the bath of $^{29}$Si nuclear spins at natural abundance. We expect that these capabilities will provide a powerful tool to investigate the effect of the environment on isolated coupled spins, uncover the details of coupled electron-muon systems in matter and validate quantum electrodynamics in the context of muonium spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Creation of a black hole bomb instability in an electromagnetic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplification and generation of electromagnetic radiation by a rotating metallic or lossy cylinder, first theorized by Zeldovich in the 1970s, is tightly connected to the concepts of quantum friction, energy extraction from rotating black holes and runaway mechanisms such as black hole bombs. Despite recent advances including acoustic analogues of the Zeldovich effect and the observation of a negative resistance in a low-frequency electromagnetic model, actual positive signal amplitude gain, the spontaneous generation of electromagnetic waves and runaway amplifi- cation effects have never been experimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that a mechanically rotating metallic cylinder not only definitively acts as an amplifier of a rotating elec- tromagnetic field mode but also, when paired with a low-loss resonator, becomes unstable and acts as a generator, seeded only by noise. The system exhibits an exponential runaway amplification of spontaneously generated electromagnetic modes thus demonstrating the electromagnetic analogue of Press and Teukolskys black hole bomb. The exponential amplification from noise supports theoretical investigations into black hole instabilities and is promising for the development of future experiments to observe quantum friction in the form of the Zeldovich effect seeded by the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Giant counter-rotating oscillations on the attosecond timescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict an unexplored type of ultrastrong coupling between atoms and intense ultraviolet light that leads to giant population oscillations on the attosecond timescale. These counter-rotating oscillations can be of similar amplitude as the elementary femtosecond Rabi oscillations between the two strongly coupled states. The effect, which is beyond the two-level atom, is non-reciprocal: It only affects the excited state, while the ground state is unaffected. We propose that two-photon Rabi oscillations (1s$^2$-1s3d) in helium is suitable for the generation of this type of ultrastrong coupling with realistic pulses. We use a combination of Floquet theory and effective Hamiltonian theory to test our predictions against ab initio simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Dynamics Algorithms on the Advection-Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as ${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$. By comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and finance.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Squeezed Kerr Oscillator based on Tapered Ion Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the realization of a mechanically squeezed Kerr oscillator with a single ion in a tapered trap. We show that the motion coupling between the axial and radial modes caused by the trap geometry leads to Kerr nonlinearity of the radial mode with magnitude controlled by the trap frequencies. This allows the realization of non-Gaussian quantum gates, which play a significant role in the universal set of continuous variable quantum gates. Furthermore, we show that, because of the nonlinearity of the ion trap, applying an off-resonant time-varying electric field along the trap axis causes a motion squeezing of the radial mode. Finally, we discuss the motion mode frequency spectrum of an ion crystal in a tapered trap. We show that the frequency gap between the motion modes increases with trap nonlinearity, which benefits the realization of faster quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Impact of Amplitude and Phase Damping Noise on Quantum Reinforcement Learning: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field with significant potential, yet it remains highly susceptible to noise, which poses a major challenge to its practical implementation. While various noise mitigation strategies have been proposed to enhance algorithmic performance, the impact of noise is not fully understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of amplitude and phase damping noise on a quantum reinforcement learning algorithm. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we assess how these noise sources influence the learning process and overall performance. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of noise in quantum learning algorithms and suggest that, rather than being purely detrimental, unavoidable noise may present opportunities to enhance QML processes.</description>

      <title>Resource reduction for variational quantum algorithms by non-demolition measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of two implementations of a variational quantum algorithm aimed at minimizing the energy of a complex quantum system. In one implementation, we extract the information of the energy gradient by projective measurements. In the second implementation, called the Non-Demolition approach, the gradient information is stored in a quantum detector, which is eventually measured. As prototypical examples, we study the energy minimization of the Lithium-based molecules and then extend the analysis systems with increased complexity. We find that, while both approaches are able to identify the energy minimum, the Non-Demolition approach has a clear advantage in terms of the overall computational resources needed. This advantage increases linearly with the complexity of the quantum system, making the Non-Demolition approach the ideal candidate to implement such variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Construction of Feasible Solutions in Column Generation using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. This study proposes a post-processing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed post-processing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time.</description>

      <title>Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) present a promising approach for combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Dynamics Learning: A Scalable Approach to Quantum Process Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process characterization is a fundamental task in quantum information processing, yet conventional methods, such as quantum process tomography, require prohibitive resources and lack scalability. Here, we introduce an efficient quantum process learning method specifically designed for short-time Hamiltonian dynamics. Our approach reconstructs an equivalent quantum circuit representation from measurement data of unknown Hamiltonian evolution without requiring additional assumptions and achieves polynomial sample and computational efficiency. Our results have broad applications in various directions. We demonstrate applications in quantum machine learning, where our protocol enables efficient training of variational quantum neural networks by directly learning unitary transformations. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum expectation values with provable efficiency and provides a robust framework for verifying quantum computations and benchmarking realistic noisy quantum hardware. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for practical quantum dynamics learning, paving the way for scalable quantum process characterization in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Walk Inspired Qubit Lattice Algorithm for Simulating Electromagnetic Wave Propagation and Scattering in Conservative and Dissipative Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Dirac representation of Maxwell equations we present an explicit, discrete space-time, quantum walk-inspired algorithm suitable for simulating the electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering from inhomogeneities within magnetized plasmas. The quantum walk is implemented on a lattice with an internal space of $n_q=4$--qubits, used to encode the classical field amplitudes. Unitary rotation gates operate within this internal space to generate the non-trivial dynamics of the free plasma-Dirac equation. To incorporate the contributions from the cyclotron and plasma density terms--manifesting as inhomogeneous potential terms--in the plasma-Dirac equation, the walk process is complemented with unitary potential operators. This leads to a unitary qubit lattice sequence that recovers the plasma-Dirac equation under a second-order accurate discretization scheme. The proposed algorithm is explicit and demonstrates, in the worst case, a polynomial quantum advantage compared to the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) classical method in terms of resource requirements and error complexity. In addition, we extend the algorithm to include dissipative effects by introducing a phenomenological collision frequency between plasma species. Then, a post-selective time-marching implementation scheme is delineated, featuring a non-vanishing overall success probability and, subsequently, eliminating the need for amplitude amplification of the output state while preserving the quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Closing the detection loophole in the triangle network with high-dimensional photonic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality without input settings, e.g. in the triangle network, has been perceived to be particularly fragile, with low robustness to noise in physical implementations. Here we show to the contrary that nonlocality based on N00N states already for $N=2$ has an exceptionally high robustness to photon loss. For the dominant noise factor, single photon loss in the transmission channels, we can certify noise robustness up to 10\% loss, while for a realistic noise model we use neural network-based heuristics to observe $\sim 50\%$ robustness. Moreover we show that the robustness holds even for imperfect sources based on SPDC sources, where the heralding information of the sources can be used to avoid any global post-processing of the outcomes, such as discarding rounds when photons fail to arrive, and thus demonstrate how the detection loophole in the triangle network can be closed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleportation, a novel scheme, initially posited by Bennett \textit{et.al}, has been studied here in the context of sending a single qutrit from Alice to Bob using two qutrit entangled channels as resources. In this paper we have considered two special two qutrit entangled states, which belong to $SU(3)$ group, as useful resources for teleportation. For the successful teleportation, these entangled states have been chosen as quantum channels shared between Alice and Bob. Another entangled basis of two qutrit states have been used as auxiliary states, which would help Alice to manipulate with her channel so that the single qutrit she holds can be successfully teleported to Bob. Bob's choices of measurement operators influence the retrieval of Alice's single qutrit.</description>

      <title>Implementation and readout of maximally entangled two-qubit gates quantum circuits in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides noticeable challenges in implementing low-error single- and two-qubit quantum gates in superconducting quantum processors, the readout technique and analysis are a key factor in determining the efficiency and performance of quantum processors. Being able to efficiently implement quantum algorithms involving entangling gates and asses their output is mandatory for quantum utility. In a transmon-based 5-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we compared the performance of quantum circuits involving an increasing level of complexity, from single-qubit circuits to maximally entangled Bell circuits. This comparison highlighted the importance of the readout analysis and helped us optimize the protocol for more advanced quantum algorithms. Here we report the results obtained from the analysis of the outputs of quantum circuits using two readout paradigms, referred to as "multiplied readout probabilities" and "conditional readout probabilities". The first method is suitable for single-qubit circuits, while the second is essential for accurately interpreting the outputs of circuits involving two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data post-processing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs -- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state. Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with multi-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for cooling: a simple case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparation of low-energy quantum many-body states has a wide range of applications in quantum information processing and condensed matter physics. Quantum cooling algorithms offer a promising alternative to other methods based, for instance, on variational and adiabatic principles, or on dissipative state preparation. In this work, we investigate a set of cooling algorithms in a simple, solvable fermionic model which allows us to identify the mechanisms which underlie the cooling process and, also, those which prevent it. We derive analytical expressions for the cooling dynamics, steady states, and cooling rates in the weak coupling limit. We find that multi-frequency and randomized cycle strategies can significantly enhance the performance of the quantum algorithm and circumvent some of the obstacles. We also analyze the effects of noise and evaluate the conditions under which cooling remains feasible. Furthermore, we present optimized cooling protocols that can significantly enhance cooling performance in the presence of noise. Additionally, we compare cooling and dissipative state preparation and show that, in the model analyzed here, cooling generally achieves lower energies and is more resilient to noise.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum metrology using non-Hermitian spin model with RT-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian transverse XY model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having RT-symmetry, referred to as iKSEA model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the iKSEA model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with N being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model, reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate.</description>

      <title>On Speedups for Convex Optimization via Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential for quantum speedups in convex optimization using discrete simulations of the Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) framework, as proposed by Leng et al., and establish the first rigorous query complexity bounds. We develop enhanced analyses for quantum simulation of Schr\"odinger operators with black-box potential via the pseudo-spectral method, providing explicit resource estimates independent of wavefunction assumptions. These bounds are applied to assess the complexity of optimization through QHD. Our findings pertain to unconstrained convex optimization in $d$ dimensions. In continuous time, we demonstrate that QHD, with suitable parameters, can achieve arbitrarily fast convergence rates. The optimization speed limit arises solely from the discretization of the dynamics, mirroring a property of the classical dynamics underlying QHD. Considering this cost, we show that a $G$-Lipschitz convex function can be optimized to an error of $\epsilon$ with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1.5}G^2 R^2/\epsilon^2)$ queries. Moreover, under reasonable assumptions on the complexity of Hamiltonian simulation, $\widetilde{\Omega}(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Thus, QHD does not offer a speedup over classical zeroth order methods with exact oracles. However, we demonstrate that the QHD algorithm tolerates $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^3/d^{1.5}G^2 R^2)$ noise in function evaluation. We show that QHD offers a super-quadratic query advantage over all known classical algorithms tolerating this level of evaluation noise in the high-dimension regime. Additionally, we design a quantum algorithm for stochastic convex optimization that provides a super-quadratic speedup over all known classical algorithms in the high-dimension regime. To our knowledge, these results represent the first rigorous quantum speedups for convex optimization achieved through a dynamical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Emission from Electronic Metastable Resonance States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that calculating the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonance states (states with finite lifetimes embedded in the continuum) requires considering transitions to all continuum states, not just to lower states. This holds even when the lifetimes of the metastable states are very long and might be effectively considered as bound states in the continuum. However, employing complex-scaling transformations, this computationally prohibitive task becomes feasible by utilizing methods originally designed for excited bound states for calculation of complex poles of the scattering matrix. As an illustrative example, these methods are applied to calculate the spontaneous emission decay rates of metastable resonance states in a double-barrier potential. The rapid numerical convergence of this approach highlights a new avenue for studying spontaneous emission from metastable states in real-life systems, particularly in many-electron systems, where calculation of the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonances (e.g., autoionization states) is computationally difficult, if not impossible, using the standard (Hermitian) formalism of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Chemically Tuning Room Temperature Pulsed Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance enables spin-based quantum sensing with high spatial resolution and sensitivity-even at room temperature-as exemplified by solid-state defects. Molecular systems provide a complementary, chemically tunable, platform for room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)-based quantum sensing. A critical parameter governing sensing sensitivity is the optical contrast-i.e., the difference in emission between two spin states. In state-of-the-art solid-state defects such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, this contrast is approximately 30%. Here, capitalizing on chemical tunability, we show that room-temperature ODMR contrasts of 40% can be achieved in molecules. Using a nitrogen-substituted analogue of pentacene (6,13-diazapentacene), we enhance contrast compared to pentacene and, by determining the triplet kinetics through time-dependent pulsed ODMR, show how this arises from accelerated anisotropic intersystem crossing. Furthermore, we translate high-contrast room-temperature pulsed ODMR to self-assembled nanocrystals. Overall, our findings highlight the synthetic handles available to optically readable molecular spins and the opportunities to capitalize on chemical tunability for room-temperature quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Distribution in Lossy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is essential for unlocking the potential of distributed quantum information processing. We consider an $N$-partite network where entanglement is distributed via a central source over lossy channels, and network participants cooperate to establish entanglement between any two chosen parties under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) constraints. We develop a general mathematical framework to assess the optimal average bipartite entanglement shared in a lossy distribution, and introduce a tractable lower bound by optimizing over a subset of single-parameter LOCC transformations. Our results show that probabilistically extracting Bell pairs from W states is more advantageous than deterministically extracting them from GHZ-like states in lossy networks, with this advantage increasing with network size. We further extend our analysis analytically, proving that W states remain more effective in large-scale networks. These findings offer valuable insights into the practical deployment of near-term networks, revealing a fundamental trade-off between deterministic entanglement distribution protocols and loss-sensitive resources.</description>

      <title>Phases with non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D $\unicode{x2013}$ symmetry protected topological orders as duality automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21764v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore 1+1 dimensional (1+1D) gapped phases in systems with non-invertible symmetries, focusing on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases (defined as gapped phases with non-degenerate ground states), as well as SPT orders (defined as the differences between gapped/gapless phases with identical bulk excitations spectrum). For group-like symmetries, distinct SPT phases share identical bulk excitations and always differ by SPT orders. However, for certain non-invertible symmetries, we discover novel SPT phases that have different bulk excitations and thus do not differ by SPT orders. Additionally, we also study the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of non-invertible symmetries. Unlike group-like symmetries, non-invertible symmetries lack the concept of subgroups, which complicates the definition of SSB phases as well as their identification. This challenge can be addressed by employing the symmetry-topological-order (symTO) framework for the symmetry. The Lagrangian condensable algebras and automorphisms of the symTO facilitate the classification of gapped phases in systems with such symmetries, enabling the analysis of both SPT and SSB phases (including those that differ by SPT orders). Finally, we apply this methodology to investigate gapless phases in symmetric systems and to study gapless phases differing by SPT orders.</description>

      <title>Quantum Port: Gamification of quantum teleportation for public engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concepts on quantum physics are generally difficult for the general public to understand and grasp due to its counter-intuitive nature and requirement for higher level of mathematical literacy. With categorical quantum mechanics (CQM), quantum theory is re-formalized into a more intuitive diagrammatic approach, which we will refer to as the first level of transformation, to improve the accessibility and readability of quantum theory to a broader audience since the mathematical details are embedded into diagrammatic rules. Taking inspiration from this diagrammatic approach, we propose the second level of transformation by gamifying the diagrammatic rules of quantum teleportation into a quantum card game called Quantum Port. In this work, we discuss the gamification process of quantum teleportation and provide a printable version of Quantum Port for public engagement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered phases of matter, such as solids, ferromagnets, superfluids, or quantum topological order, typically only exist at low temperatures. Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to "entropic order", whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles.</description>

      <title>Effective Description of Ajar Systems with a $U(1)$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</description>

      <title>Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general strategy to develop quantum many-body approximations of primitives in linear algebra algorithms. As a practical example, we introduce a coupled-cluster inspired framework to produce approximate Hamiltonian moments, and demonstrate its application in various linear algebra algorithms for ground state estimation. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the difference between the ground-state energies arising from quantum many-body linear algebra and those from the analogous many-body perturbation theory. Our results support the general idea of designing quantum many-body approximations outside of perturbation theory, providing a route to new algorithms and approximations.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures and decoherence during inflation from deep subhorizon perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to shed light on the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial perturbations in single field inflation, we investigate the decoherence and associated quantum corrections to the correlation functions of superhorizon scalar curvature perturbations. The latter are considered as an open quantum system which undergoes quantum decoherence induced by a time-dependent environment of deep subhorizon tensorial modes through the trilinear interactions predicted by General Relativity. We first prove that, in full generality, a time dependent subhorizon environment can be relevant for decoherence during inflation, by considering derivativeless interactions, which, in our case, give the most important results. For the first time, the time dependence of the environment is properly taken into account by modifying the quantum master equation. Important non-Markovian effects pop up, instead, when dealing with derivative interactions. We adopt a possible way to treat them which has been recently proposed and seems well suited for our case. Our results show that when considering the interplay between derivativeless and derivative interactions, decoherence is slowed down. This underlines the importance of accounting for all the interactions in open quantum-system calculations in an inflationary setting. We finally compute the quantum corrections to cosmological correlation functions, by solving the transport equations induced by the quantum master equation. We also compare the results to the solutions obtained by an alternative method previously used in the literature. We observe a resummation of the quantum corrections to the power-spectrum, which is a general property of quantum master equations. We extend these results to the bispectrum, showing a decay of this correlation function in time which is analogous to the one found, previously, for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior due to the competition between excitation and relaxation at large amplitudes, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. We image the nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase in varying excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, modulation of the wavenumber is observed across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to the spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We present the first--ever example of a macroscopic system in a quantum superposition. The system in question is a Siamese cat known as Lola; however, on a time scale of about 12 hours it oscillates into a different state that we refer to as "Mola". In the "Lola" state, the system is sweet and friendly and allows to cuddle itself, but in the "Mola" state, it is malevolent and witchy. When the probability of the system being in the "Mola" state is high, decoherence is strongly discouraged!</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we propose a platform based on ultra-cold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists in a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons (a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator) becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two-dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry and local TRS - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles theoretical model of strongly coupled photonic molecules composed of interacting dielectric cavities. We demonstrate the predictive power of this model, illustrating the ability to compute supermode eigenfrequencies, field profiles, and mode volumes, given only knowledge of the individual cavity mode profiles and dielectric background, without expensive electromagnetic simulations on the composite structure or numerical fitting. While our model affirms the phenomenological approach of modeling coupled cavity modes as simple coordinate-coupled oscillators in the weak coupling regime, we show that this intuition remarkably breaks down for strong coupling. Instead, we demonstrate that strongly coupled cavity modes are analogous to harmonic oscillators we term as doubly coupled, with interactions via electric and magnetic fields appearing as independent coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum couplings, respectively. We show that this distinction is not merely cosmetic, but gives rise to observable properties while providing deep insights into the physical mechanism behind previously observed phenomena, such as coupling induced frequency shifts. Finally, we illustrate that the complex interplay of these dual couplings suggests the possibility to realize exotic phenomena that typically only occur in the ultrastrong coupling regime, here predicted to emerge for comparably modest mode splittings within a regime we term pseudo-ultrastrong coupling.</description>

      <title>Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.</description>

      <title>The limits of knowledge in classical physics resemble the quantum uncertainty relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon a recent analysis of the measurement process in Hamiltonian mechanics, this article investigates the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics -- the landscape of accessible probability distributions over phase space. I prove a thermodynamic limitation on the information that can be obtained about a classical system by means of observations: A direct analogue of the Robertson-Schr\"odinger quantum uncertainty relation controls the acquisition of information at the classical microscale. Central to this theorem is the notion of the "quality" of a measuring probe; a temperature-dependent strictly positive quantity that serves as a figure of merit of the probe, and that plays the role of $1/\hbar$ in the classical uncertainty relation. This study sets the stage for a new area of research into resource theories of classical measurement, in which high-quality measurements and high-information states of knowledge are the limited resources.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V&lt; V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V&gt;V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.</description>

      <title>Strain effects in a directly bonded diamond-on-insulator substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Contrasting exchange-field and spin-transfer torque driving mechanisms in all-electric electron spin resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Realizing practical quantum advantage with meaningful economic impact is the holy grail of the quantum information field. Recent quantum technology advances have driven exponential growth in quantum information research, with resultant publications achieving significantly elevated impact.

      <title>Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and its Free-fall Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory(ECT), in which the weak equivalence principle is violated by the spin-gravitational interaction. We derive the general equation of geodesic in terms of comoving tetrads. More concretely, we consider the case of the quadratic form of the lagrangian, within the environment of weak and static spherically symmetric space-time. We find that the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash Papapetrou equation, which is due to the coupling of the spin of the test particle to the torsion field of the environment. This allows us to test the theory with free-fall experiment in the laboratory, such as atom interferometer. By using the previous data, we find the upper bound of the possible torsion field on Earth is given by up to $2.0\times 10^{1} \mathrm{~m^{-1}}$ and torsion gradient up to $3.1 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{~m^{-2}}$. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a thermal bath that preserves the conservation of a system's angular momentum or allows it to fluctuate around a specified nonzero mean while maintaining a Boltzmann distribution of energy in the steady state.We demonstrate that classical particles immersed in such baths exhibit position-momentum uncertainties with a strictly positive lower bound proportional to the absolute value of the mean angular momentum. The proportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and independent of the system's parameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains the exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study QED$_4$ in the adiabatic approximation, incorporating global topological effects associated with the $U(1)$ Berry connection. The Berry phase accumulated by the fermionic vacuum is given by $\Delta \alpha = \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \gamma_5\, \mathcal{A}^{(n)}$, where $\mathcal{A}^{(n)}$ is a closed but non-exact one-form defined over the space of gauge configurations. This chiral holonomy induces an emergent vacuum angle that contributes non-perturbatively to the effective action. The partition function decomposes into topological sectors weighted by this geometric phase, analogous to quantum systems on multiply connected spaces. Our results reveal that even in Abelian gauge theory, the infrared regime can exhibit global effects beyond the reach of local or perturbative descriptions.</description>

      <title>Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential for quantum annealing to solve realistic routing problems. We focus on two NP-Hard problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. We utilize D-Wave's Quantum Annealer and Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) solver within a hybrid framework to solve these problems. We demonstrate that while the CQM solver effectively minimizes route costs, it struggles to maintain time window feasibility as the problem size increases. To address this limitation, we implement a heuristic method that fixes infeasible solutions through a series of swapping operations. Testing on benchmark instances shows our method achieves promising results with an average optimality gap of 3.86%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis, which is recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. In this work, we extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>How interacting Bose gases scatter light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local) beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1709.03995v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that multipartite quantum states that have a positive partial transpose with respect to all bipartitions of the particles can outperform separable states in linear interferometers. We introduce a powerful iterative method to find such states. We present some examples for multipartite states and examine the scaling of the precision with the particle number. Some bipartite examples are also shown that possess an entanglement very robust to noise. We also discuss the relation of metrological usefulness to Bell inequality violation. We find that quantum states that do not violate any Bell inequality can outperform separable states metrologically. We present such states with a positive partial transpose, as well as with a non-positive positive partial transpose.</description>

      <title>Alternating Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin Approximation to the Schr\"{o}dinger Equation: Rediscover the Bremmers series and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of Wenzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for solving the Schr\"odinger equation. A set of coupled differential equations is obtained by considering an ansatz of the wave function with an auxiliary condition on gauging its first derivative. It is shown that the alternating perturbation method can decouple the set of differential equations, yielding the well know Bremmer series, and in addition, by virtue of improvement on amplitudes, can refine the phase of the wave function in a sequence of recursive diagonalizations. We therefore find a general quantization formula in which the geometric-optical-like physics is encoded. Whenever the ratio of the differential reflection coefficient and the classical momentum remains constant, we show that our general quantized formula will reduce to the closed-form quantization condition that agrees with the result obtained by re-summation the perturbative WKB series to all orders.</description>

      <title>Finite-round quantum error correction on symmetric quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heisenberg limit provides a quadratic improvement over the standard quantum limit, and is the maximum quantum advantage that quantum sensors could provide over classical methods. This limit remains elusive, however, because of the inevitable presence of noise decohering quantum sensors. Namely, if infinite rounds of quantum error correction corrects any part of a quantum sensor's signal, a no-go result purports that the standard quantum limit scaling can not be exceeded. We side-step this no-go result by using an optimal finite number of rounds of quantum error correction and an adaptive procedure of signal recovery, such that even if part of the signal is corrected away, our quantum field sensing protocol's precision can approach the Heisenberg limit despite a linear rate of deletion errors. Our protocol is based on quantum error correction codes within the symmetric subspace, which admit near-term implementations using quantum control techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Causal Inference with Extremely Light Touch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10544v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a causal inference scheme using quantum observations alone for a case with both temporal and spatial correlations: a bipartite quantum system with measurements at two times. The protocol determines compatibility with 5 causal structures distinguished by the direction of causal influence and whether there are initial correlations. We derive and exploit a closed-form expression for the space-time pseudo-density matrix (PDM) for many times and qubits. This PDM can be determined by light-touch coarse-grained measurements alone. We prove that if there is no signalling between two subsystems, the reduced state of the PDM cannot have negativity, regardless of initial spatial correlations. In addition, the protocol exploits the time asymmetry of the PDM to determine the temporal order. The protocol succeeds for a state with coherence undergoing a fully decohering channel. Thus coherence in the channel is not necessary for the quantum advantage of causal inference from observations alone.</description>

      <title>Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Quantum Advantage in Communication with Minimal Input Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In communication complexity-like problems, previous studies have shown either an exponential quantum advantage or an unbounded quantum advantage with an exponentially large input set $\Theta(2^{n})$ bits with respect to classical communication $\Theta(n)$ bits. In the former, the quantum and classical separation grows exponentially in input while the latter's quantum communication resource is a constant. Remarkably, it was still open whether an unbounded quantum advantage exists while the inputs do not scale exponentially. Here we answer this question affirmatively using an input size of optimal order. Considering two variants as tasks: 1) distributed computation of relation and 2) {\it relation reconstruction}, we study the one-way zero-error communication complexity of a relation induced by a distributed clique labelling problem for orthogonality graphs. While we prove no quantum advantage in the first task, we show an {\it unbounded quantum advantage} in relation reconstruction without public coins. Specifically, for a class of graphs with order $m$, the quantum complexity is $\Theta(1)$ while the classical complexity is $\Theta(\log_2 m)$. Remarkably, the input size is $\Theta(\log_2 m)$ bits and the order of its scaling with respect to classical communication is {\it minimal}. This is exponentially better compared to previous works. Additionally, we prove a lower bound (linear in the number of maximum cliques) on the amount of classical public coin necessary to overcome the separation in the scenario of restricted communication and connect this to the existence of Orthogonal Arrays. Finally, we highlight some applications of this task to semi-device-independent dimension witnessing and the detection of Mutually Unbiased Bases.</description>

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task for analyzing unlabeled data based solely on its underlying distribution. Spectral clustering is a clustering method that represents a dataset as a graph and uses the relationships between data points. However, classical spectral clustering methods incur high computational costs that can scale cubically with the dataset size-as is typical for approaches that involve solving eigenvalue problems. In this work, we propose Variational Quantum Approximated Spectral Clustering (VQASC), which extends quantum distance-based classifier models to the clustering framework. Our approach uses efficient quantum circuit designs whose depth scales sub-quadratically with dataset size, enabling the computation of weighted sums over various matrix representations of an undirected graph. Furthermore, we adopt an empirical risk formulation to reduce the impact of local minima arising from parameterized quantum circuits, and we validate our approach through simulations on real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of ``non-locality of a single photon'', which started with a paper by Tan, Walls and Collett (TWC, 1991) stirred a thirty years long debate. This hampered attempts to use the TWC interferometric scheme in quantum cryptography. The scheme involves a single photon 50-50 beam-split into two modes propagating to two spatially separated observation stations at which weak homodyne measurements are made. The physics and non-classicality of such an arrangement has been understood only recently, and points out that an unquestionable Bell non-classicality, as was suggested by Hardy (1994), can be observed when the local measurement settings differ by the weak local oscillator being on or off, and additionally the homodyning for the on case is not balanced. Based on that, we present a single-photon based device-independent quantum key distribution scheme secure even against no-signaling eavesdropping. In our protocol the random bits of the cryptographic key are obtained by measurements on the single photon, that is for off settings at both Alice and Bob sides, while the security is positively tested if for eavesdropping testing runs one observes a violation of a specific Bell inequality involving the on and off weak homodyne measurements as alternative local settings. The security analysis presented here is based on a decomposition of the correlations into extreme points of a no-signaling polytope, which allows for identification of the optimal strategy for any eavesdropping constrained only by the no-signaling principle. For this strategy, the key rate is calculated, which is then connected with the violation of a specific Clauser-Horne inequality. We also adapt this analysis to propose a self-testing quantum random number generator based on the old idea that employs the randomness of reflection and transmission events of a quantum light impinged on a 50-50 beamsplitter.</description>

Abstract: Block encoding is a key ingredient in the recently developed quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) framework, which provides a unifying description for many quantum algorithms. Initially introduced to simplify and optimize resource utilization in various problems, such as searching, amplitude estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, it is reasonable to expect that the capabilities of QSVT extend beyond these applications and offer untapped potential for designing new quantum algorithms. In this article, we affirm this perspective by leveraging block encoding to substantially enhance two previously proposed quantum algorithms: largest eigenvalue estimation and quantum gradient descent. Unlike previous works that rely on sophisticated approaches, our findings demonstrate that even just elementary operations within the unitary block encoding framework can eliminate major scaling factors present in their original counterparts. This results in significantly more efficient quantum algorithms capable of tackling target computational problems with remarkable efficiency. Furthermore, we illustrate how our proposed method can be extended to other contexts, including matrix inversion and multiple eigenvalue estimation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of nuclear polarization via discrete measurement of NV center spin evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for the estimation of the initial polarization of spinful nuclei of the 13 C isotope in diamond via a measurement of the evolution of the coherence of an NV center spin qubit. Existing polarization measurement methods are difficult to implement experimentally, because they require direct interference in the environment of the qubit. Here, in order to obtain the information, it is necessary to measure the qubit coherence at certain points of time, which are unambiguously determined by the applied magnetic field. For sufficiently high magnetic fields, the minimum value of the measured coherence constitutes an upper bound on the product of the initial polarizations of each environmental spin. The most significant advantage of the method, which allows to infer initial values of nuclear polarizations without any direct access to the environment, lies in its simplicity and the small amount of experimental resources that it requires. We exemplify the operation of the scheme on a realistic, randomly generated environment of eight nuclear spins, obtaining a reasonably accurate estimation of the initial polarization.</description>

Abstract: Many resource theories share an interesting property: An operation is free if and only if its renormalized Choi matrix is a free state. In this letter, we refer to resource theories exhibiting this property as Choi-defined resource theories. We demonstrate how and under what conditions one can construct a Choi-defined resource theory, and we prove that when such a construction is possible, the free operations are all and only the completely resource non-generating operations. Moreover, we examine resource measures, a complete family of monotones, and conversion distances in such resource theories.</description>

      <title>Spatially parallel decoding for multi-qubit lattice surgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Running quantum algorithms protected by quantum error correction requires a real time, classical decoder. To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits.
  These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Piquasso quantum programming framework, a full-stack open-source software platform for the simulation and programming of photonic quantum computers. Piquasso can be programmed via a high-level Python programming interface enabling users to perform efficient quantum computing with discrete and continuous variables. Via optional high-performance C++ backends, Piquasso provides state-of-the-art performance in the simulation of photonic quantum computers. The Piquasso framework is supported by an intuitive web-based graphical user interface where the users can design quantum circuits, run computations, and visualize the results.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, time correlators have received renewed attention, especially under the guise of identifiers of nonclassical correlations. However, the physical interpretation of these objects, and more generally of multi-times variables, remains ambiguous, which may be one of the reasons why they are so difficult to measure. In this work, we introduce and advance the perspective that a two-time correlator should actually be regarded as an average involving a novel single physical observable, one that cannot be rephrased in terms of the primitive ones, according to quantum principles. In particular, we provide examples showing that the presumed constituents of a two-time correlator and the proposed two-time operator itself cannot be simultaneous elements of the physical reality.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a new quantum PageRank algorithm on graphs using discrete-time open quantum walks. Google's PageRank is a widely used algorithm for ranking the web pages on the World Wide Web in classical computation. From a broader perspective, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also serves to quantify the significance of a network's vertices. In this work, we extend the concept of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs by utilizing the Weyl operators as Kraus operators. This new model of quantum walk is useful for building up the quantum PageRank algorithm, discussed in this article. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, GNC, GN, GNR networks, Barab\'asi and Albert network, etc. In addition, we study the convergence of the quantum PageRank process and its dependency on the damping factor $\alpha$. We observe that this quantum PageRank procedure is faster than many other proposals reported in the literature.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces quantum edge detection, aimed at locating boundaries of quantum domains where all particles share the same pure state. Focusing on the 1D scenario of a string of particles, we develop an optimal protocol for quantum edge detection, efficiently computing its success probability through Schur-Weyl duality and semidefinite programming techniques. We analyze the behavior of the success probability as a function of the string length and local dimension, with emphasis in the limit of long strings. We present a protocol based on square root measurement, which proves asymptotically optimal. Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario where the state of particles transitions from known to unknown, which may find practical applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices</description>

      <title>What is the spectral density of the reservoir for a lossy quantized cavity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering a two-level system weakly coupled to a single lossy three-dimensional cavity mode, and using a quasinormal mode expansion for the photonic medium, we show that the frequency-dependence of the quantum coupling interaction between the cavity and its photonic reservoir can not be simply constructed to be independent of the cavity contents. For the single quantum dipole case, we identify the correct form of the local spectral density, revealing a surprising gauge-dependent $\sim \omega^{\pm 1} prefactor scaling, as well as a spatially-dependent correction. We thus establish the correct quantum form for the cavity-reservoir interaction, which so far has only been worked out rigorously for simple 1D geometries, and show its significant impact on broadband strong coupling.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Grover's Algorithm in the classical rainbow table, uncovering the potential of integrating quantum computing techniques with conventional cryptographic methods to develop a Quantum Rainbow Table Proof-of-Concept. This leverages on Quantum concepts and algorithms which includes the principle of qubit superposition, entanglement and teleportation, coupled with Grover's Algorithm to enable a more efficient search through the rainbow table. The paper also details on the hardware constraints and the work around to produce better results in the implementation stages. Through this work we develop a working prototype of quantum rainbow table and demonstrate how quantum computing could significantly improve the speed of cyber tools such as password crackers and thus impact the cyber security landscape.</description>

      <title>Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs with classical computers is an expensive procedure. This is due to the need to classically simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails computational costs that scale rapidly with system size. Similarly, exact simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will either only be possible for short times with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, or will require a fault-tolerant QC which is currently beyond technological capabilities. This motivates a search for alternative approaches to determine OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians describing local one-dimensional quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods (KMs) can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC and a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating small batches of labelled data with classical tensor network methods for quantum many-body systems with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the Laplacian and radial basis function (RBF) kernels perform best, achieving a coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) on the testing sets of at least 0.7167, with averages between 0.8112 and 0.9822 for the various sets of Hamiltonians, together with small root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Hence, after training, the models can replace further uses of tensor networks for calculating an OTOC function of a system within the parameterised sets. Accordingly, the proposed method can assist with extensive evaluations of an OTOC function.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body simulation of finite-temperature systems with sampling a series expansion of a quantum imaginary-time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating thermal-equilibrium properties at finite temperature is crucial for studying quantum many-body systems. Quantum computers are expected to enable us to simulate large systems at finite temperatures, overcoming challenges faced by classical computers, like the sign problem of the quantum Monte-Carlo technique. Conventional methods suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) devices are designed for studying large-scale quantum many-body systems but require a large number of ancilla qubits and a deep quantum circuit with many basic gates, making them unsuitable for the early stage of the FTQC era, at which the availability of qubits and quantum gates is limited. In this paper, we propose a method suitable for quantum devices in this early stage to calculate the thermal-equilibrium expectation value of an observable at finite temperatures. Our proposal, named the Markov-chain Monte Carlo with sampled pairs of unitaries (MCMC-SPU) algorithm, involves sampling simple quantum circuits and generating the corresponding statistical ensembles. This approach addresses the issues of resource demand and the decay in probability associated with postselection of measurement outcomes on ancilla qubits. We validate our proposal with numerical simulation on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as an illustrative example.</description>

Abstract: What is fundamentally quantum? We argue that most of the features, problems, and paradoxes -- such as the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend paradox and its proposed solutions, single particle nonlocality, and no-cloning -- allegedly attributed to quantum physics have a classical analogue if one is to interpret classical physics as fundamentally indeterministic. What really characterizes non-classical effects are incompatible physical quantities, which, in quantum quantum theory are associated to the fundamental constant $\hbar$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we develop an open quantum system view of the parametric approximation, which allows us to obtain systematic perturbative corrections to it. We consider the Jaynes-Cummings model with dissipation, assuming that the field is in the regime close to the parametric approximation with depletion. We obtain non-unitary corrections to the parametric approximation and additional dynamical Lamb-shift contributions to it. For high detuning, these non-unitary corrections appear to be non-Markovian before depletion. And we show that even after depletion, initial non-Markovian behaviour contributes to the dynamics via laser-induced polishing of the density matrix.</description>

Abstract: We investigate multi-mode GKP (Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill) quantum error-correcting codes from a geometric perspective. First, we construct their moduli space as a quotient of groups and exhibit it as a fiber bundle over the moduli space of symplectically integral lattices. We then establish the Gottesman--Zhang conjecture for logical GKP Clifford operations, showing that all such gates arise from parallel transport with respect to a flat connection on this space. Specifically, non-trivial Clifford operations correspond to topologically non-contractible paths on the space of GKP codes, while logical identity operations correspond to contractible paths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize multiple fields by solving complex problems that can not be solved in reasonable time with current classical computers. Nevertheless, the development of quantum computers is still in its early stages and the available systems have still very limited resources. As such, currently, the most practical way to develop and test quantum algorithms is to use classical simulators of quantum computers. In addition, the development of new quantum computers and their components also depends on simulations.
  Given the characteristics of a quantum computer, their simulation is a very demanding application in terms of both computation and memory. As such, simulations do not scale well in current classical systems. Thus different optimization and approximation techniques need to be applied at different levels.
  This review provides an overview of the components of a quantum computer, the levels at which these components and the whole quantum computer can be simulated, and an in-depth analysis of different state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Besides the optimizations that can be performed at the algorithmic level, this review presents the most promising hardware-aware optimizations and future directions that can be explored for improving the performance and scalability of the simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in quantum machine learning has sparked interest in using quantum methods to tackle classical control problems via quantum reinforcement learning. However, the classical reinforcement learning environments often scale to high dimensional problem spaces, which represents a challenge for the limited and costly resources available for quantum agent implementations. We propose to solve this dimensionality challenge by a classical autoencoder and a quantum agent together, where a compressed representation of observations is jointly learned in a hybrid training loop. The latent representation of such an autoencoder will serve as a tailored observation space best suited for both the control problem and the QPU architecture, aligning with the agent's requirements. A series of numerical experiments are designed for a performance analysis of the latent-space learning method. Results are presented for different control problems and for both photonic (continuous-variable) and qubit-based agents, to show how the QNN learning process is improved by the joint training.</description>

      <title>An Implementation of the Finite Element Method in Hybrid Classical/Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents the Quantum Finite Element Method (Q-FEM) developed for use in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and employs the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) algorithm. The proposed method leverages the classical FEM procedure to perform the unitary decomposition of the stiffness matrix and employs generator functions to design explicit quantum circuits corresponding to the unitaries. Q-FEM keeps the structure of the finite element discretization intact allowing for the use of variable element lengths and material coefficients in FEM discretization. The proposed method is tested on a steady-state heat equation discretized using linear and quadratic shape functions. Numerical verification studies are performed on the IBM QISKIT simulator and it is demonstrated that Q-FEM is effective in converging to the correct solution for a variety of problems and model discretizations, including with different element lengths, variable coefficients, and different boundary conditions. The formalism developed herein is general and can be extended to problems with higher dimensions. However, numerical examples also demonstrate that the number of parameters for the variational ansatz scale exponentially with the number of qubits, and increases the odds of convergence. Moreover, the deterioration of system conditioning with problem size results in barren plateaus and convergence difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erasures are the primary type of errors in physical systems dominated by leakage errors. While quantum error correction (QEC) using stabilizer codes can combat erasure errors, it remains unknown which constructions achieve capacity performance. If such codes exist, decoders with linear runtime in the code length are also desired. In this paper, we present erasure capacity-achieving quantum codes under maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), though MLD requires cubic runtime in the code length. For QEC, using an accurate decoder with the shortest possible runtime will minimize the degradation of quantum information while awaiting the decoder's decision. To address this, we propose belief propagation (BP) decoders that run in linear time and exploit error degeneracy in stabilizer codes, achieving capacity or near-capacity performance for a broad class of codes, including bicycle codes, product codes, and topological codes. We furthermore explore the potential of our BP decoders to handle mixed erasure and depolarizing errors, and also local deletion errors via concatenation with permutation invariant codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in quantum physics, dictating the behavior and dynamics of physical systems. In this paper, we develop a hypothesis-testing framework for quantum dynamics symmetry using a limited number of queries to the unknown unitary operation and establish the quantum max-relative entropy lower bound for the type-II error. We construct optimal ancilla-free protocols that achieve optimal type-II error probability for testing time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) and diagonal symmetry (Z-symmetry) with limited queries. Contrasting with the advantages of indefinite causal order strategies in various quantum information processing tasks, we show that parallel, adaptive, and indefinite causal order strategies have equal power for our tasks. We establish optimal protocols for T-symmetry testing and Z-symmetry testing for 6 and 5 queries, respectively, from which we infer that the type-II error exhibits a decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(m^{-2})$ with respect to the number of queries $m$. This represents a significant improvement over the basic repetition protocols without using global entanglement, where the error decays at a slower rate of $\mathcal{O}(m^{-1})$.</description>

Abstract: The nature-inspired field of quantum communication has witnessed exciting developments over the past few years with countries all over the world working hard to scale their experimental quantum networks to larger sizes and increased coverage. Evidently, quantum network simulators are the need of the hour as they provide a framework for tuning hardware parameters, optimizing control protocols, and testing configurations of large and complex quantum networks before their deployment in the real world. In this work, we present ShaNQar (Simulator of Network Quantique): a modular and customizable photonic quantum network simulator. It comprises models of components such as photons, lasers, neutral density filters, sources of entangled photon pairs, communication channels, mirrors, waveplates, beam splitters, single photon detectors, and nodes which incorporate a diverse set of tunable parameters for variability and versatility. It enables adaptive timing control and synchronization with virtually no simulation time resolution limit and features a 'plug and play' design for faster coding and efficient execution. We successfully simulated previous real-life experimental setups for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and quantum teleportation, thereby, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of ShaNQar.</description>

      <title>Randomness-free Detection of Non-projective Measurements: Qubits &amp; beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-projective measurements play a crucial role in various information-processing protocols. In this work, we propose an operational task to identify measurements that are neither projective nor classical post-processing of data obtained from projective measurements. Our setup involves space-like separated parties with access to a shared state with bounded local dimensions. Specifically, in the case of qubits, we focus on a bipartite scenario with different sets of target correlations. While some of these correlations can be obtained through non-projective measurements on a shared two-qubit state, it is impossible to generate these correlations using {\it projective simulable} measurements on bipartite qubit states, or equivalently, by using one bit of shared randomness and local post-processing. For certain target correlations, we show that detecting qubit non-projective measurements is robust under {\it arbitrary} depolarising noise, except in the limiting case. We extend this task for qutrits and demonstrate that some correlations achievable via local non-projective measurements cannot be reproduced by both parties performing the same qutrit {\it projective simulable} measurements on their pre-shared state. We provide numerical evidence for the robustness of this scheme under {\it arbitrary} depolarising noise. For a more generic consideration (bipartite and tripartite scenario), we provide numerical evidence for a projective-simulable bound on the reward function for our task. We also show a violation of this bound by using qutrit POVMs. From a foundational perspective, we extend the notion of non-projective measurements to general probabilistic theories (GPTs) and use a randomness-free test to demonstrate that a class of GPTs, called {\it square-bits or box-world} are unphysical.</description>

Abstract: Superpositions of handed molecular states give rise to achiral eigenstates, delocalized across a double-well potential via tunneling. A coherent superposition of these energy eigenstates could dynamically relocalize the molecules into chiral states, which has only been addressed theoretically. Here, we present a microwave six-wave mixing pump-probe study to create and probe coherent chiral tunneling dynamics in a rotational state. Through a time-resolved scheme, we uncover the periodic time evolution of the induced chiral wavepacket under field-free conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate precise phase control of this coherence via phase modulation during pump excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) is one of the notable architectures to achieve large-scale trapped-ion quantum computers. To realize QCCD architecture, ions must be transported quickly while minimizing motional excitation. High-voltage sources are necessary to achieve such high-quality ion transport through a high secular frequency. In this study, we report the development of a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based digital-to-analog converter (DAC) system with an output voltage range of +/-50 V and demonstrate its effectiveness in ion transport operations. The device provides 16-channel analog output, maximum update rate of 16 mega updates per second (MUPS), slew rate of 20 V/us, and bandwidth of &gt; 200 kHz. By optimizing the voltage sets with quadratic programming, we experimentally confirmed that this DAC system can achieve more than twice the secular frequency attainable when its output range is restricted to +/-10 V, which is consistent with the fact that scaling all electrode voltages by a factor of 5 will scale the secular frequency by the square root of 5. Since the output range of many commercially available DACs is commonly limited to +/-10 V, this increase is effective for ion shuttling operations, such as transport, split and merge. The developed DAC system has potential to increase the speed of ion transport thereby reducing processing times in QCCD-based quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Reflections are omnipresent tools in quantum algorithms. We consider the task of reflecting through the eigenspace of an implementable unitary. Such reflections are generally designed using phase estimation or linear combination of unitaries. These methods have size and depth that scale favorably with the desired precision and the spectral gap of the unitary. However, they require a number of ancilla qubits that grows with both parameters. Here, we present a simple algorithm with the same size and depth scaling but requiring only 4 ancilla qubits for all problem instances. As such, this algorithm is expected to become the reference method to reflect through eigenspaces of unitaries.</description>

      <title>Monotones in Resource Theories for Dynamical Decoupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2110.02613, we presented a generalised dynamical resource theory framework that enabled noise reduction techniques including dynamical decoupling (DD) to be studied. While this fundamental contribution remains correct, it has been found that the main resource quantifiers we employed to study these resource theories -- based on the relative entropies between Choi states of multitime processes -- are not monotonic under the allowed transformations. In this letter we detail modified relative entropy-based resource quantifiers, prove that they are indeed monotonic in our resource theories. We re-interpret our numerical results in terms of these new relative entropy monotones, arriving at the same empirical conclusions: DD can be understood as temporal resource distillation, and improvements to noise reduction via our multitimescale optimal dynamical decoupling (MODD) method coincide with a decrease in the corresponding non-Markovianity monotone.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of quantum operators written as a linear combination of permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider matrices given as a linear combination of permutations and analyze the impact of bit and phase-flips on the perturbation of the eigenvalues. When the coefficients in the linear combination are positive, we observe that the eigenvalues of the resulting matrices exhibit resilience to quantum bit-flip errors. In addition, we analyze the bit-flips in combination with positive and negative coefficients and the phase-flips. Although matrices with mixed-sign coefficients show less resilience to the bit-flip and phase-flip errors, the numerical evidence shows that the perturbation of the eigenspectrum is very small when the rate of these errors is small. We also discuss the situation when this matrix is implemented through block encoding and there is a control register. Since any square matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of permutations multiplied by two scaling matrices from the left and right (via Sinkhorn's theorem), this paper gives a framework to study matrix computations in quantum algorithms related to numerical linear algebra. In addition, it can give ideas to design more error-resilient algorithms that may involve quantum registers with different error characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era require algorithms that can generate shallower circuits feasible for today's quantum systems. This is particularly challenging for quantum chemistry applications due to the inherent complexity of molecular systems. Working with pharmaceutically relevant molecules containing sulfonyl fluoride ($SO_2F$) warheads used in targeted covalent drug development, we combine Hamiltonian terms truncation, Clifford Decomposition and Transformation (CDAT), and optimized transpilation techniques to achieve up to a 28.5-fold reduction in circuit depth when assuming all-to-all connectivity of quantum hardware. When employed on IBMQ's Heron architecture, we demonstrate up to a 15.5-fold reduction. Through these methods, we reduced circuit depths to 1330 gates for 8-qubit Hamiltonian dynamics simulations. Using middleware solutions for circuit decomposition, we successfully executed sub-circuits with depths up to 371 gates containing 216 2-qubit gates, representing one of the largest electronic structure Hamiltonian dynamics calculations implemented on current quantum hardware. The systematic circuit reduction approach shows promise for scaling to larger active spaces, while maintaining sufficient accuracy for molecular reactivity predictions using the Quantum-Centric Data-Driven R&amp;D framework. This work highlights practical methods for exploring commercially relevant chemistry problems on quantum hardware through Hamiltonian simulation, with direct applications to pharmaceutical drug development.</description>

      <title>Advantages and limitations of channel multiplexing for discrete-variable quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typically practical realizations of discrete-variable quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, based on exchanging single-photon signals between the trusted parties, can provide its users with only very low key generation rates. One of the potential solutions for this problem, that can be adapted for the case of entanglement-based QKD schemes using broadband photon-pair sources, is to utilize wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) modules in order to split the photons with different wavelengths to separate detection channels and generate multiple keys in parallel. Here, we theoretically investigate this idea in the case of pulsed laser used to pump spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. We optimize the effective phase-matching function width of the nonlinear crystal, and the intensity and duration of the pump laser pulses in order to maximize the advantage of the overall key generation rate provided by the WDM-based QKD scheme over the traditional no-WDM scenario. The results of our analysis show that the considered method can significantly accelerate the production of cryptographic keys, but proper optimization of the photon-pair source is needed to exploit its full potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform direct fidelity estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using only local Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ, W, and Dicke states, establishing tighter bounds (by factor of $14.22$ and $16$ for GHZ and W, respectively) on the number of measurements required for desired precision. These protocols are derived by adjusting the distribution of observables. Notably, they require no preprocessing steps other than the sampling algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work exploits a framework whereby a graph (in the mathematical sense) serves to connect a classical system to a state space that we call `quantum-like' (QL). The QL states comprise arbitrary superpositions of states in a tensor product basis. The graph plays a special dual role by directing design of the classical system and defining the state space. We study a specific example of a large, dynamical classical system -- a system of coupled phase oscillators -- that maps, via a graph, to the QL state space. We investigate how mixedness of the state diminishes or increases as the underlying classical system synchronizes or de-synchronizes respectively. This shows the interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of the variables of the classical system and the QL state space. We prove that maps from one time point to another in the state space are linear maps. In the limit of a strongly phase-locked classical network -- that is, where couplings between phase oscillators are very large -- the state space evolves according to unitary dynamics, whereas in the cases of weaker synchronization, the classical variables act as a hidden environment that promotes decoherence of superpositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results show that Kochen-Specker (KS) sets of observables are fundamental to quantum information, computation, and foundations beyond previous expectations. Among KS sets, those that are unique up to unitary transformations (i.e., "rigid") are especially important. The problem is that we do not know any rigid KS set in $\mathbb{C}^3$, the smallest quantum system that allows for KS sets. Moreover, none of the existing methods for constructing KS sets leads to rigid KS sets in $\mathbb{C}^3$. Here, we show that two fundamental structures of quantum theory define two rigid KS sets. One of these structures is the super-symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measure. The other is the minimal state-independent contextuality set. The second construction provides a clue to solve the minimal KS problem, the most important open problem in this field. We prove that there is no KS set of 30 elements that can be obtained from the minimal state-independent contextuality set by completing bases and adding elements that are orthogonal to two previous elements. We conjecture that 31 is the solution to the minimal KS set problem.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum error correction based on hyperbolic Floquet codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers significant speedups, but the large number of physical qubits required for quantum error correction introduces engineering challenges for a monolithic architecture. One solution is to distribute the logical quantum computation across multiple small quantum computers, with non-local operations enabled via distributed Bell states. Previous investigations of distributed quantum error correction have largely focused on the surface code, which offers good error suppression but poor encoding rates, with each surface code instance only able to encode a single logical qubit. In this work, we argue that hyperbolic Floquet codes are particularly well-suited to distributed quantum error correction for two reasons. Firstly, their hyperbolic structure enables a high number of logical qubits to be stored efficiently. Secondly, the fact that all measurements are between pairs of qubits means that each measurement only requires a single Bell state. Through simulations, we show that distributed hyperbolic Floquet codes offer good performance under local and non-local circuit-level noise. This shows that distributed quantum error correction is not only possible but efficiently realisable.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Based Binary Graph Encoding for Variational Quantum Classifiers</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing has been a prominent research area for decades, inspiring transformative fields such as quantum simulation, quantum teleportation, and quantum machine learning (QML), which are undergoing rapid development. Within QML, hybrid classical-quantum algorithms like Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) have shown promise in leveraging quantum circuits and classical optimizers to classify classical data efficiently.Simultaneously, classical machine learning has made significant strides in graph classification, employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze systems ranging from large-scale structures like the Large Hadron Collider to molecular and biological systems like proteins and DNA. Combining the advancements in quantum computing and graph classification presents a unique opportunity to develop quantum algorithms capable of extracting features from graphs and performing their classification effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum encoding framework for graph classification using VQCs. Unlike existing approaches such as PCA-VQC, which rely on dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and may lead to information loss, our method preserves the integrity of graph data. Furthermore, our encoding approach is optimized for Noise-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, requiring a limited number of qubits while achieving comparable or superior classification performance to PCA-VQC. By constructing slightly more complex circuits tailored for graph encoding, we demonstrate that VQCs can effectively classify graphs within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Construction of new type of CNOT gate using cross-resonance pulse in the transmon-PPQ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transmon, known for its fast operation time and the coherence time of tens of microseconds, is the most commonly used qubit for superconducting quantum processors. However, it is still necessary to enhance the coherence time and the gate fidelity of superconducting quantum processors for the practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Meanwhile, a novel superconducting qubit, which has the ability to protect the Cooper-pair parity on the superconducting island, has been proposed. This new qubit shows better coherence performance than the transmon, but it does not yet have an efficient method for realizing a superconducting hybrid system that harnesses it.
  In this work, we show how to implement a new type of CNOT gate in a superconducting hybrid system composed of tunable transmon and parity-protected qubit by applying a cross-resonance pulse. First, we provide hardware specifications and pulse parameters to construct a successful two-qubit gate in the hybrid system. Second, we show that our method can supply a CNOT gate of average fidelity with more than 0.998. Therefore, our work implies that the hybrid system may provide a new platform for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Quantum Friction, Self-Propulsion, and Self-Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the nonequilibrium fluctuational forces and torques acting on a body either in motion or at rest relative to another body or to the thermal vacuum blackbody radiation. We consider forces and torques beyond the usual static Casimir-Polder and Casimir forces and torques. For a moving body, a retarding force emerges, called quantum or Casimir friction, which in vacuum was first predicted by Einstein and Hopf in 1910. Nonreciprocity may allow a stationary body, out of thermal equilibrium with its environment, to experience a torque. Moreover, if a stationary reciprocal body is not in thermal equilibrium with the blackbody vacuum, a self-propulsive force or torque can appear, resulting in a potentially observable linear or angular terminal velocity, even after thermalization.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Newtonian Gravity with stable vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Gravitational Poissonian Spontaneous Localization (GPSL) model, a hybrid classical-quantum model in which classical Newtonian gravity emerges from stochastic collapses of the mass density operator, and consistently couples to quantum matter. Unlike models based on continuous measurement schemes, GPSL ensures vacuum stability; this, together with its applicability to identical particles and fields, makes it a promising candidate for a relativistic generalization. We derive the master equation governing the dynamics, analyze the model's general properties, and compare its predictions with those of the Tilloy-Di\'osi models. Notably, GPSL predicts a short-range gravitational back-reaction and permits decoherence rates below the Di\'osi-Penrose bound, thereby evading the "Principle of Least Decoherence." We provide explicit examples, including the dynamics of a single particle and a rigid sphere, to illustrate the distinctive phenomenology of the model. Finally, we discuss the experimental testability of GPSL, highlighting both interferometric and non-interferometric strategies to constrain its parameters and distinguish it from competing models.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Dirac oscillator in $(1+1)$ and $(2+1)$ dimensions and generalize it in the spirit of the isotonic oscillator using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In $(1+1)$ dimensions, the Dirac oscillator returns to the quantum harmonic oscillator in the non-relativistic limit, while its generalization maps to the isotonic oscillator. We describe exact solutions of these generalized systems and also present their non-relativistic limits. Finally, based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we show that a generalized Dirac oscillator in $(2+1)$ dimensions can be mapped to an anti-Jaynes-Cummings-like Hamiltonian in which the spin operators couple with the supercharges.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model for Histogram Distribution-based Quantum Watermarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum image representation and quantum measurement techniques has made quantum image processing research a hot topic. In this paper, a novel Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model (AQSM) is first proposed for scrambling watermark images. Then, on the basis of the proposed AQSM, a novel quantum watermarking scheme is presented. Unlike existing quantum watermarking schemes with fixed embedding scales, the proposed method can flexibly embed watermarks of different sizes. In order to improve the robustness of the watermarking algorithm, a novel Histogram Distribution-based Watermarking Mechanism (HDWM) is proposed, which utilizes the histogram distribution property of the watermark image to determine the embedding strategy. In order to improve the accuracy of extracted watermark information, a quantum refining method is suggested, which can realize a certain error correction. The required key quantum circuits are designed. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed quantum watermarking method are evaluated by simulation experiments on three image size scales. The results demonstrate the invisibility and good robustness of the watermarking algorithm.</description>

      <title>Demolition measurement protocol for transmon qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of measuring a qubit and re-initializing it to the ground state practically lead to long qubit idle times between re-runs of experiments on a superconducting quantum computer. Here, we propose a protocol for a \textit{demolition measurement} of a transmon qubit that integrates qubit readout with the reset process to minimize qubit idle time. We present a three-staged implementation of this protocol, involving a combined qubit readout and resonator reset scheme that unconditionally resets the resonator at the end of the readout; a leakage removal scheme that can be integrated with the measurement stage; and an unconditional qubit reset. We demonstrate that this protocol could be implemented in $1 \, \mu$s with greater than $95 \, \%$ reset fidelity and a $99 \, \%$ readout fidelity without any hardware overhead beyond those commonly used. This provides at least a 50x speed up compared to the passive decay of the qubit, thereby significantly increasing the data-acquisition rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized-bicycle (GB) quantum error-correcting codes have naturally redundant minimum-weight stabilizer generators. To use this redundancy, we constructed several short GB codes with relatively large dimensions, distances, and syndrome distances, also admitting fault-tolerant near-time-optimal syndrome measurement schedules. We simulated their performance both under phenomenological noise and standard circuit noise, using sliding window sequential decoding protocol covering $T\ge 1$ measurement rounds at a time, based on an in-house binary BP+OSD decoder. While true single-shot decoding ($T=1$) may suffer from a significant loss of accuracy, already two-shot ($T=2$) decoding gives nearly the same logical error rates as multi-shot with much larger $T$. Comparison with the same codes but redundant stabilizer generators dropped show significantly improved decoding accuracy for all $T\ge1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the random Schr\"odinger equation, with a noise term given by a random Hermitian matrix as a means to model noisy quantum systems. We derive bounds on the error of the synthesised unitary in terms of bounds on the norm of the noise, and show that for certain noise processes these bounds are tight. We then show that in certain situations, minimising the error is equivalent to finding a geodesic on SU (n) with respect to a Riemannian metric encoding the coupling between the control pulse and the noise process. Our work thus extends the series of seminal papers by Nielsen et al. on the geometry of quantum gate complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved version of a quantum amplitude encoding scheme that encodes the $N$ entries of a unit classical vector $\vec{v}=(v_1,..,v_N)$ into the amplitudes of a quantum state. Our approach has a quadratic speed-up with respect to the original one. We also describe several generalizations, including to complex entries of the input vector and a parameter $M$ that determines the parallelization. The number of qubits required for the state preparation scales as $\mathcal{O}(M\log N)$. The runtime, which depends on the data density $\rho$ and on the parallelization paramater $M$, scales as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}\frac{N}{M}\log (M+1))$, which in the most parallel version ($M=N$) is always less than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}\log N)$. By analysing the data density, we prove that the average runtime is $\mathcal{O}(\log^{1.5} N)$ for uniformly random inputs. We present numerical evidence that this favourable runtime behaviour also holds for real-world data, such as radar satellite images. This is promising as it allows for an input-to-output advantage of the quantum Fourier transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly-polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. We verify our predicted complementary response in rubidium vapour cell experiments and through density matrix calculations. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic polarimetry for quantum metrological electric field characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.</description>

Abstract: The integration of photonic components into surface ion traps provides a scalable approach for trapped-ion quantum computing, sensing, and metrology, enabling compact systems with enhanced stability and precision. However, the introduction of optical apertures in the trap electrodes can distort the trapping electric field. This can lead to excess micromotion (EMM) and ion displacement which degrade the performance of quantum logic operations and optical clocks. In this work, we systematically investigate the electric field distortion in a surface ion trap with integrated waveguides and grating couplers using Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We analyze methods to reduce these distortions by exploiting symmetries and transparent conductive oxide materials.</description>

This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of MIET in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic One-Time Programs from Geometrically Local $\text{QNC}_0$ Adversaries</title>

Abstract: We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and $D$-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant $D$. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.
  Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order $2$) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific $2 \mapsto 1$ QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.</description>

      <title>Feedback Connections in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Mid-Circuit Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing can be broadly categorized into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: While restart-based methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to allow the model to remember past inputs.</description>

      <title>Qunity: A Unified Language for Quantum and Classical Computing (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQASM, proving the realizability of our design.</description>

      <title>Learning in Quantum Common-Interest Games and the Separability Problem</title>

Abstract: Learning in games has emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning with numerous applications. Quantum games model interactions between strategic players who have access to quantum resources, and several recent works have studied {learning in} the competitive regime of quantum zero-sum games. Going beyond this setting, we introduce quantum common-interest games (CIGs) where players have density matrices as strategies and their interests are perfectly aligned. We bridge the gap between optimization and game theory by establishing the equivalence between KKT (first-order stationary) points of an instance of the Best Separable State (BSS) problem and the Nash equilibria of its corresponding quantum CIG. This allows learning dynamics for the quantum CIG to be seen as decentralized algorithms for the BSS problem. Taking the perspective of learning in games, we then introduce non-commutative extensions of the continuous-time replicator dynamics and the discrete-time best response dynamics/linear multiplicative weights update for learning in quantum CIGs. We prove analogues of classical convergence results of the dynamics and explore differences which arise in the quantum setting. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cognitive Paradoxes in Video Games: A Quantum Mechanical Perspective</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum-mechanical model that bridges the realms of cognition and quantum mechanics, offering a novel perspective on decision-making under risk and perceptual reversals. By integrating quantum theories addressing decision-theoretic anomalies with examples from immersive video games like "Deal or No Deal", we seek to elucidate complex human cognitive behaviours. Study 1 showcases the proposed quantum model's superiority over traditional decision-making approaches using the "Deal or No Deal" video game experiment. In Study 2, we apply our model to bistable perceptions, taking the Necker cube from the Necker game as a primary example. While previous works have hinted at connections between quantum mechanics and cognition, Study 3 provides a more tangible link, likening the physics that underpins quantum tunnelling to an eye blink's role in perceptual reversals. Conclusively, our model displays a promising ability to interpret diverse optical illusions and psychological phenomena, marking a significant stride in understanding human decision making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive multiparty games that, if the winning chance exceeds a certain limit, prove the incompatibility of the parties' causal relations with any partial order. This, in turn, means that the parties exert a back-action on the causal relations; the causal relations are dynamical. The games turn out to be representable by directed graphs, for instance by an orientation of the M\"obius ladder. We discuss these games as device-independent tests of spacetime's dynamical nature in general relativity. To do so, we design relativistic settings where, in the Minkowski spacetime, the winning chance is bound to the limits. In contrast, we find otherwise tame processes with classical control of causal order that win the games deterministically. These suggest a violation of the bounds in gravitational implementations. We obtain these games by uncovering a "pairwise central symmetry" of the correlations in question. This symmetry allows us to recycle the facets of the acyclic subgraph polytope studied by Gr\"otschel, J\"unger, and Reinelt in the mid-80s for combinatorial optimization. In addition, we derive multiparty games in a scenario where the polytope dimension grows only linearly in the number of parties. Here, exceeding the limits not only proves the dynamical nature of the causal relations, but also that the correlations are incompatible with any global causal order.</description>

      <title>Gauged cooling of topological excitations and emergent fermions on quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulated cooling is a robust method for preparing low-energy states of many-body Hamiltonians on near-term quantum simulators. In such schemes, a subset of the simulator's spins (or qubits) are treated as a ``bath,'' which extracts energy and entropy from the system of interest. However, such protocols are inefficient when applied to systems whose excitations are highly non-local in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom, such as topological phases of matter; such excitations are difficult to extract by a local coupling to a bath. We explore a route to overcome this obstacle by encoding of the microscopic degrees of freedom into those of the quantum simulator in a non-local manner. To illustrate the approach, we show how to efficiently cool the ferromagnetic phase of the quantum Ising model, whose excitations are domain walls, via a ``gauged cooling'' protocol in which the Ising spins are coupled to a $Z_2$ gauge field that simultaneously acts as a reservoir for removing excitations. We show that our protocol can prepare the ground states of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases equally efficiently. The gauged cooling protocol naturally extends to (interacting) fermionic systems, where it is equivalent to cooling by coupling to a fermionic bath via single-fermion hopping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distinctive characteristics of light, such as high-speed and low-loss propagation, low cross-talk and low power consumption, along with photons unique quantum properties, make it most suitable for various applications in communication, high-resolution imaging, optical computing, and emerging quantum information technologies. One limiting factor, though, is the weak optical nonlinearity of conventional media that poses challenges for the control of light with ultra-low intensities. In this work, we demonstrate all-optical modulation enabled by electron avalanche process in silicon, using a control beam with single-photon light intensities. The observed process corresponds to a record-high nonlinear refractive index of $n_{2}$~$1.3*10^{-2} m^2/W$, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the best known nonlinear optical materials. Our approach opens the possibility of gigahertz-speed, and potentially even faster, optical switching at the single-photon level, which could enable a family of novel on-chip photonic and quantum devices operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Violation of LGtI inequalities in the light of NO$\nu$A and T2K anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent anomaly observed in NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments in standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation could potentially signal physics extending beyond the standard model (SM). For the NSI parameters that can accommodate this anomaly, we explore the violation of Leggett-Garg type inequalities (LGtI) within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. Our analysis focuses on LGtI violations in scenarios involving complex NSI with $\epsilon_{e\mu}$ or $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ coupling in long baseline accelerator experiments for normal and inverted mass ordering.LGtI violation is significantly enhanced in normal ordering (NO) for $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ scenario for T2K, NO$\nu$A, and DUNE experiment set-up. We find that for inverted ordering (IO), in the DUNE experimental set-up above $8.5$ GeV, the LGtI violation can be an indication of $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ new physics scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling of Rydberg vapors medium both to microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g. weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of conventional RF antenna in the detector. The trouble with this approach arises, as the greatest sensitivity is exhibited with the use of additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, and the measurement can no longer be all-optical. Here we propose a different solution, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining exceptional sensitivity. We tackle the issue of laser phase noise, emerging in this type of detection, via a simultaneous measurement of the phase spectrum in a nonlinear process and real-time data processing, which overall yields an improvement of $35\ \mathrm{dB}$ in terms of signal-to-noise ratio compared with the basic approach. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field. This approach is directly comparable to the state of the art superheterodyne, while retaining the merits of all-optical detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers. An important open question is how to efficiently prepare the ground states of arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonians, especially those with nontrivial topology. Here, we propose an efficient protocol for preparing low-energy states of fermionic Hamiltonians on a noisy bosonic quantum simulator by adiabatic cooling using a simulated bath. We arrange the couplings such that the simulated system and bath together obtain a local fermionic description in which fermionic excitations can be extracted individually, via coherent hopping to the bath, rather than in pairs as would otherwise be required by fermion parity conservation. This approach thus achieves a linear (rather than quadratic) scaling of the cooling rate vs. excitation density at low densities. We show that certain topological phases such as the chiral (non-Abelian) phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be prepared efficiently using our protocol. Our protocol performs favorably in the presence of noise, making it suitable for execution on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional periodically driven systems of fermions with particle-hole symmetry. Such systems support non-trivial topological phases, including ones that cannot be realized in equilibrium. We show that a space-time defect in the driving Hamiltonian, dubbed a ``time vortex,'' can bind $\pi$ Majorana modes. A time vortex is a point in space around which the phase lag of the Hamiltonian changes by a multiple of $2\pi$. We demonstrate this behavior on a periodically driven version of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes and time vortices can realize any combination of $0$ and $\pi$ Majorana modes. We show that a time vortex can be created using Clifford gates, simplifying its realization in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Second-order correlation and squeezing of photons in cavities with ultrastrong magnon-photon interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultrastrong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhances the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing the cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in the antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and impose a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade for quantum information technology in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dynamic approach based on the multiconfiguration Haqrtree method to description of exciton self-trapping is proposed. Primarily motivated by the phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high excitation concentrations we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. In particular, based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steady-state solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The bi-self-trapped exciton in the mirror-symmetric configuration can be described by the Dicke Hamiltonian and is responsible for superfluorescence. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically-exact algorithm using few-body revealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Velocity and Spin Dependent Exotic Interaction at the Millimeter Scale with a Diamagnetic-levitated Force Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method based on diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling $g_A^e g_V^N$ are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the constraint $|g_A^e g_V^N| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.</description>
