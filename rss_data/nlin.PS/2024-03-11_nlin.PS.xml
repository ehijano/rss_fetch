      <title>Learning Traveling Solitary Waves Using Separable Gaussian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a machine-learning approach to learn traveling solitary waves across various families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach integrates a novel interpretable neural network (NN) architecture, called Separable Gaussian Neural Networks (SGNN) into the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Unlike the traditional PINNs that treat spatial and temporal data as independent inputs, the present method leverages wave characteristics to transform data into the so-called co-traveling wave frame. This adaptation effectively addresses the issue of propagation failure in PINNs when applied to large computational domains. Here, the SGNN architecture demonstrates robust approximation capabilities for single-peakon, multi-peakon, and stationary solutions within the (1+1)-dimensional, $b$-family of PDEs. In addition, we expand our investigations, and explore not only peakon solutions in the $ab$-family but also compacton solutions in (2+1)-dimensional, Rosenau-Hyman family of PDEs. A comparative analysis with MLP reveals that SGNN achieves comparable accuracy with fewer than a tenth of the neurons, underscoring its efficiency and potential for broader application in solving complex nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>A design methodology for nonlinear oscillator chains enabling energy localization tuning and soliton stability enhancement with optimal damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the vibration energy localization in coupled nonlinear oscillators is investigated, based on the creation of standing solitons. The main objective is to establish a design methodology for mechanical lattices using the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a guide strategy, even in the presence of damping. A three-dimensional diagram is used to illustrate stable parameter regions for damped stationary solitons. Moreover, an analysis of the influence of the number of oscillators in the system, and a numerical investigation regarding the stability of solitonic behavior is done. Through numerical analyses, it is observed that the developed algorithm not only has the capability to locate the highest amplitudes in the chain of oscillators, but also to control the intensity at which these amplitudes are located according to design requirements. The outcomes of the proposed methodology elucidate the impact that the coupling stiffness has on the stabilization of the NLSE, as well as the influence of the number of oscillators on the continuity hypothesis. The developed algorithm holds potential for practical applications in mechanical engineering since the NLSE is used as a design line rather than as a consequence of the phenomenon description.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the slow component in timescale separated synchronized oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physiological networks are usually made of a large number of biological oscillators evolving on a multitude of different timescales. Phase oscillators are particularly useful in the modelling of the synchronization dynamics of such systems. If the coupling is strong enough compared to the heterogeneity of the internal parameters, synchronized states might emerge where phase oscillators start to behave coherently. Here, we focus on the case where synchronized oscillators are divided into a fast and a slow component so that the two subsets evolve on separated timescales. We assess the resilience of the slow component by reducing the dynamics of the fast one and evaluating the variance of the phase deviations when the oscillators in the two components are subject to noise with possibly distinct correlation times. From the general expression for the variance, we consider specific network structures and show how the noise transmission between the fast and slow components is affected. Interestingly, we find that oscillators that are among the most robust when there is only a single timescale, might become the most vulnerable when the system separates into two timescales. We also find that layered networks seem to be insensitive to timescale separations when the noise has homogeneous correlation time.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation and Asymptotics of Cubically Nonlinear Transverse Magnetic Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Maxwell equations for transverse magnetic (TM) polarized fields support single frequency surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) localized at the interface of a metal and a dielectric. Metals are typically dispersive, i.e. the dielectric function depends on the frequency. We prove the bifurcation of localized SPPs in dispersive media in the presence of a cubic nonlinearity and provide an asymptotic expansion of the solution and the frequency. The problem is reduced to a system of nonlinear differential equations in one spatial dimension by assuming a plane wave dependence in the direction tangential to the (flat) interfaces. The number of interfaces is arbitrary and the nonlinear system is solved in a subspace of functions with the $H^1$-Sobolev regularity in each material layer. The corresponding linear system is an operator pencil in the frequency parameter due to the material dispersion. Because of the TM-polarization the problem cannot be reduced to a scalar equation.
  The studied bifurcation occurs at a simple isolated eigenvalue of the pencil. For geometries consisting of two or three homogeneous layers we provide explicit conditions on the existence of eigenvalues and on their simpleness and isolatedness. Real frequencies are shown to exist in the nonlinear setting in the case of PT-symmetric materials. We also apply a finite difference numerical method to the nonlinear system and compute bifurcating curves.</description>
