      <title>Thresholds for Reconstruction of Random Hypergraphs From Graph Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph projection of a hypergraph is a simple graph with the same vertex set and with an edge between each pair of vertices that appear in a hyperedge. We consider the problem of reconstructing a random $d$-uniform hypergraph from its projection. Feasibility of this task depends on $d$ and the density of hyperedges in the random hypergraph. For $d=3$ we precisely determine the threshold, while for $d\geq 4$ we give bounds. All of our feasibility results are obtained by exhibiting an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the original hypergraph, while infeasibility is information-theoretic.
  Our results also apply to mildly inhomogeneous random hypergrahps, including hypergraph stochastic block models (HSBM). A consequence of our results is an optimal HSBM recovery algorithm, improving on a result of Guadio and Joshi in 2023.</description>

      <title>On (in)consistency of M-estimators under contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider robust location-scale estimators under contamination. We show that commonly used robust estimators such as the median and the Huber estimator are inconsistent under asymmetric contamination, while the Tukey estimator is consistent. In order to make nuisance parameter free inference based on the Tukey estimator a consistent scale estimator is required. However, standard robust scale estimators such as the interquartile range and the median absolute deviation are inconsistent under contamination.</description>

      <title>Likelihood asymptotics of stationary Gaussian arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the asymptotic likelihood theory for triangular arrays of stationary Gaussian time series depending on a multidimensional unknown parameter. We give sufficient conditions for the associated sequence of statistical models to be locally asymptotically normal in Le Cam's sense, which in particular implies the asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimator. Unique features of the array setting covered by our theory include potentially non-diagonal rate matrices as well as spectral densities that satisfy different power-law bounds at different frequencies and may fail to be uniformly integrable. To illustrate our theory, we study efficient estimation for noisy fractional Brownian motion under infill asymptotics and for a class of autoregressive models with moderate deviations from a unit root.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric estimation of net survival under dependence between death causes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative survival methodology deals with a competing risks survival model where the cause of death is unknown. This lack of information occurs regularly in population-based cancer studies. Non-parametric estimation of the net survival is possible through the Pohar Perme estimator. Derived similarly to Kaplan-Meier, it nevertheless relies on an untestable independence assumption. We propose here to relax this assumption and provide a generalized non-parametric estimator that works for other dependence structures, by leveraging the underlying stochastic processes and martingales. We formally derive asymptotics of this estimator, providing variance estimation and log-rank-type tests. Our approach provides a new perspective on the Pohar Perme estimator and the acceptability of the underlying independence assumption. We highlight the impact of this dependence structure assumption on simulation studies, and illustrate them through an application on registry data relative to colorectal cancer, before discussing potential extensions of our methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy and its various generalizations are important in many fields, including mathematical statistics, communication theory, physics and computer science, for characterizing the amount of information associated with a probability distribution. In this paper we propose goodness-of-fit statistics for the multivariate Student and multivariate Pearson type II distributions, based on the maximum entropy principle and a class of estimators for Renyi entropy based on nearest neighbour distances. We prove the L2-consistency of these statistics using results on the subadditivity of Euclidean functionals on nearest neighbour graphs, and investigate their rate of convergence and asymptotic distribution using Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for Levy-driven graph supOU processes: From short- to long-memory in high-dimensional time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces Levy-driven graph supOU processes, offering a parsimonious parametrisation for high-dimensional time-series, where dependencies between the individual components are governed via a graph structure. Specifically, we propose a model specification that allows for a smooth transition between short- and long-memory settings while accommodating a wide range of marginal distributions.
  We further develop an inference procedure based on the generalised method of moments, establish its asymptotic properties and demonstrate its strong finite sample performance through a simulation study.
  Finally, we illustrate the practical relevance of our new model and estimation method in an empirical study of wind capacity factors in an European electricity network context.</description>

      <title>Regularization can make diffusion models more efficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.</description>

Abstract: We explore the behavior and establish new properties of the cumulative-sum process (CUSUM) and its running maximum. The study includes precise expressions for CUSUM's moment generating function and moments, fast recursive computing algorithms, lower and upper bounds, as well as asymptotes. Results are applied to single, multiple, and transient change-point problems, for the calculation of thresholds that provide a desired control of familywise false alarm rates, as well as the quantiles of queuing processes and probabilities of their large deviation at least once over a given time interval.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning of Multi-index Models via Iterative Subspace Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning Multi-Index Models (MIMs) with label noise under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is any function $f$ that only depends on a $K$-dimensional subspace. We focus on well-behaved MIMs with finite ranges that satisfy certain regularity properties. Our main contribution is a general robust learner that is qualitatively optimal in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Our algorithm iteratively constructs better approximations to the defining subspace by computing low-degree moments conditional on the projection to the subspace computed thus far, and adding directions with relatively large empirical moments. This procedure efficiently finds a subspace $V$ so that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is close to a function of the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto $V$. Conversely, for functions for which these conditional moments do not help, we prove an SQ lower bound suggesting that no efficient learner exists.
  As applications, we provide faster robust learners for the following concept classes:
  * {\bf Multiclass Linear Classifiers} We give a constant-factor approximate agnostic learner with sample complexity $N = O(d) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first constant-factor agnostic learner for this class whose complexity is a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  * {\bf Intersections of Halfspaces} We give an approximate agnostic learner for this class achieving 0-1 error $K \tilde{O}(\mathrm{OPT}) + \epsilon$ with sample complexity $N=O(d^2) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first agnostic learner for this class with near-linear error dependence and complexity a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  Furthermore, we show that in the presence of random classification noise, the complexity of our algorithm scales polynomially with $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Fast Tensor Completion via Approximate Richardson Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tensor completion (TC) through the lens of low-rank tensor decomposition (TD). Many TD algorithms use fast alternating minimization methods, which solve highly structured linear regression problems at each step (e.g., for CP, Tucker, and tensor-train decompositions). However, such algebraic structure is lost in TC regression problems, making direct extensions unclear. To address this, we propose a lifting approach that approximately solves TC regression problems using structured TD regression algorithms as blackbox subroutines, enabling sublinear-time methods. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of our approximate Richardson iteration based algorithm, and we demonstrate on real-world tensors that its running time can be 100x faster than direct methods for CP completion.</description>

      <title>Global Fr\'echet regression from time correlated bivariate curve data in manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12585v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global Fr\'echet regression is addressed from the observation of a strictly stationary bivariate curve process, evaluated in a finite--dimensional compact differentiable Riemannian manifold, with bounded positive smooth sectional curvature. The involved univariate curve processes respectively define the functional response and regressor, having the same Fr\'echet functional mean. The supports of the marginal probability measures of the regressor and response processes are assumed to be contained in a ball, whose radius ensures the injectivity of the exponential map. This map has time--varying origin at the common marginal Fr\'echet functional mean. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted in the definition of the theoretical loss function. The regularized Fr\'echet weights are computed, in the time--varying tangent space from the log--mapped regressors. Under these assumptions, and some Lipschitz regularity sample path conditions, when a unique minimizer exists, the uniform weak--consistency of the empirical Fr\'echet curve predictor is obtained, under mean--square ergodicity of the log--mapped regressor process in the first two moments. A simulated example in the sphere illustrates the finite sample size performance of the proposed Fr\'echet predictor. Predictions in time of the spherical coordinates of the magnetic field vector are obtained from the time--varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft in the real--data example analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a semiparametric latent space model for analyzing longitudinal network data. The model consists of a static latent space component and a time-varying node-specific baseline component. We develop a semiparametric efficient score equation for the latent space parameter by adjusting for the baseline nuisance component. Estimation is accomplished through a one-step update estimator and an appropriately penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We derive oracle error bounds for the two estimators and address identifiability concerns from a quotient manifold perspective. Our approach is demonstrated using the New York Citi Bike Dataset.</description>

      <title>Consistency of empirical distributions of sequences of graph statistics in networks with dependent edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the first steps in applications of statistical network analysis is frequently to produce summary charts of important features of the network. Many of these features take the form of sequences of graph statistics counting the number of realized events in the network, examples of which include the degree distribution, as well as the edgewise shared partner distribution, and more. We provide conditions under which the empirical distributions of sequences of graph statistics are consistent in the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm in settings where edges in the network are dependent. We accomplish this by elaborating a weak dependence condition which ensures that we can obtain exponential inequalities which bound probabilities of deviations of graph statistics from the expected value. We apply this concentration inequality to empirical distributions of sequences of graph statistics and derive non-asymptotic bounds on the $\ell_{\infty}$-error which hold with high probability. Our non-asymptotic results are then extended to demonstrate uniform convergence almost surely in selected examples. We illustrate theoretical results through examples, simulation studies, and an application.</description>

      <title>Bridging Root-$n$ and Non-standard Asymptotics: Dimension-agnostic Adaptive Inference in M-Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript studies a general approach to construct confidence sets for the solution of population-level optimization, commonly referred to as M-estimation. Statistical inference for M-estimation poses significant challenges due to the non-standard limiting behaviors of the corresponding estimator, which arise in settings with increasing dimension of parameters, non-smooth objectives, or constraints. We propose a simple and unified method that guarantees validity in both regular and irregular cases. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive width analysis of the proposed confidence set, showing that the convergence rate of the diameter is adaptive to the unknown degree of instance-specific regularity. We apply the proposed method to several high-dimensional and irregular statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-based Effect Measures for Compositional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing effect measures for compositional features are inadequate for many modern applications, for example, in microbiome research, since they display traits such as high-dimensionality and sparsity that can be poorly modelled with traditional parametric approaches. Further, assessing -- in an unbiased way -- how summary statistics of a composition (e.g., racial diversity) affect a response variable is not straightforward. We propose a framework based on hypothetical data perturbations which defines interpretable statistical functionals on the compositions themselves, which we call average perturbation effects. These effects naturally account for confounding that biases frequently used marginal dependence analyses. We show how average perturbation effects can be estimated efficiently by deriving a perturbation-dependent reparametrization and applying semiparametric estimation techniques. We analyze the proposed estimators empirically on simulated and semi-synthetic data and demonstrate advantages over existing techniques on data from New York schools and microbiome data.</description>
