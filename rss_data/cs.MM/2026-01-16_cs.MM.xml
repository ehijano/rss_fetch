      <title>EditEmoTalk: Controllable Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation with Continuous Expression Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic and expressive facial motions directly from audio. While recent methods achieve high-quality lip synchronization, they often rely on discrete emotion categories, limiting continuous and fine-grained emotional control. We present EditEmoTalk, a controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation framework with continuous emotion editing. The key idea is a boundary-aware semantic embedding that learns the normal directions of inter-emotion decision boundaries, enabling a continuous expression manifold for smooth emotion manipulation. Moreover, we introduce an emotional consistency loss that enforces semantic alignment between the generated motion dynamics and the target emotion embedding through a mapping network, ensuring faithful emotional expression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditEmoTalk achieves superior controllability, expressiveness, and generalization while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Code and pretrained models will be released.</description>

      <title>Subjective evaluation of UHD video coded using VVC with LCEVC and ML-VVC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a subjective quality assessment of a multilayer video coding configuration in which Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) is applied as an enhancement layer on top of a Versatile Video Coding (VVC) base layer. The evaluation follows the same test methodology and conditions previously defined for MPEG multilayer video coding assessments, with the LCEVC enhancement layer encoded using version 8.1 of the LCEVC Test Model (LTM). The test compares reconstructed UHD output generated from an HD VVC base layer with LCEVC enhancement against two reference cases: upsampled VVC base layer decoding and multilayer VVC (ML-VVC). Two operating points are considered, corresponding to enhancement layers representing approximately 10% and 50% of the total bitrate. Subjective assessment was conducted using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) methodology with twenty five participants, across a dataset comprising fifteen SDR and HDR sequences. The reported results include Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with associated 95% confidence intervals, enabling comparison of perceptual quality across coding approaches and operating points within the defined test scope.</description>

      <title>SIN-Bench: Tracing Native Evidence Chains in Long-Context Multimodal Scientific Interleaved Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multimodal LLMs for Egocentric Video Understanding: A Solution for the HD-EPIC VQA Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with complex video QA benchmarks like HD-EPIC VQA due to ambiguous queries/options, poor long-range temporal reasoning, and non-standardized outputs. We propose a framework integrating query/choice pre-processing, domain-specific Qwen2.5-VL fine-tuning, a novel Temporal Chain-of-Thought (T-CoT) prompting for multi-step reasoning, and robust post-processing. This system achieves 41.6% accuracy on HD-EPIC VQA, highlighting the need for holistic pipeline optimization in demanding video understanding. Our code, fine-tuned models are available at https://github.com/YoungSeng/Egocentric-Co-Pilot.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Refinement of Universal Multimodal Attacks on Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Low-rate Image Compression with Frequency-aware Diffusion Prior Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $\epsilon$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.</description>

      <title>Handling Missing Modalities in Multimodal Survival Prediction for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.</description>

      <title>The State-of-the-Art in Lifelog Retrieval: A Review of Progress at the ACM Lifelog Search Challenge Workshop 2022-24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06743</link>

Abstract: The ACM Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) is a venue that welcomes and compares systems that support the exploration of lifelog data, and in particular the retrieval of specific information, through an interactive competition format. This paper reviews the recent advances in interactive lifelog retrieval as demonstrated at the ACM LSC from 2022 to 2024. Through a detailed comparative analysis, we highlight key improvements across three main retrieval tasks: known-item search, question answering, and ad-hoc search. Our analysis identifies trends such as the widespread adoption of embedding-based retrieval methods (e.g., CLIP, BLIP), increased integration of large language models (LLMs) for conversational retrieval, and continued innovation in multimodal and collaborative search interfaces. We further discuss how specific retrieval techniques and user interface (UI) designs have impacted system performance, emphasizing the importance of balancing retrieval complexity with usability. Our findings indicate that embedding-driven approaches combined with LLMs show promise for lifelog retrieval systems. Likewise, improving UI design can enhance usability and efficiency. Additionally, we recommend reconsidering multi-instance system evaluations within the expert track to better manage variability in user familiarity and configuration effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision transformers in vision-language models typically use the same amount of compute for every image, regardless of whether it is simple or complex. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive computation approach that enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both the early-exit and full-depth paths. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.959 with human labelling whilst delivering 4.4x faster complexity prediction. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% faster image encoding while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.</description>
