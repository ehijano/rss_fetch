      <title>Insights on Metal Enrichment and Environmental Effect at $z\approx5-7$ with JWST ASPIRE/EIGER and Chemical Evolution Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for a parent sample of 604 galaxies at $z=5.34-6.94$ with [\text{O}~\textsc{iii}] doublets detected, using the deep JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) observations in 26 quasar fields. The sample incorporates the full observations of 25 quasar fields from JWST Cycle 1 GO program ASPIRE and the quasar SDSS J0100+2802 from JWST EIGER program. We identify 204 galaxies residing in overdense structures using friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. We estimate the electron temperature of $2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\times10^4$ K from the Hg and $[\text{O}~\textsc{iii}]_{4363}$ lines in the stacked spectrum, indicating a metal-poor sample with median gas phase metallicity 12+$\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.64^{+0.23}_{-0.11}$. With the most up-to-date strong line calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a metal enhancement of $\sim0.2$ dex at high mass end in overdense environments. However, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our galaxy sample at $z&gt;5$ shows a metal deficiency of $\sim0.2$ dex relative to FMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical model, and we favor dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain the metallicity properties at $z&gt;5$. Those high redshift galaxies are likely in a rapid gas accretion phase when their metal and gas contents are in a non-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members are closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have higher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that the accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key role in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier onset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at $z\approx5-7$.</description>

      <title>Broken Expectations: The Effects of Modelling Assumptions on the Inferred Dark Matter Distribution in the Milky Way's Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical Jeans equation is commonly used to infer dark matter distributions in dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way to constrain the nature of dark matter. One of its assumptions is that of dynamical equilibrium while the dwarfs are under the influence of Galactic tides. We carry out tailored simulations of Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor and Ursa Minor and analyse the accuracy of dark matter density profiles and annihilation rates (J-factors) recovered with the Jeans equation, using pyGravSphere. We find that tides do not significantly affect the quality of density profile inference when using a bound sample of stars in the 5 simulated dwarfs; however, pyGravSphere tends to underestimate the inner densities of dwarf galaxies, which, together with tidal mass loss, leads to an inference of flatter density slopes, although all of our dwarfs have cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White haloes. The recovered J-factors are generally underestimated. While the difference with the true J-factor is small, the error bars are often underestimated and must be at least of order 0.1 dex to encompass the true J-factor. We also test the accuracy of the Wolf et al. 2010 mass estimator and find that it can be sensitive to orbital stage and eccentricity. Still, for our sample of dwarf galaxies, the estimates agree with the truth within 10%. Consistency of our simulated dwarfs with the mass-concentration relation in LambdaCDM requires a light Milky Way, or limited action of tides, which may be in tension with a "tidal stirring" origin of dwarf spheroidals.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM is still not broken: empirical constraints on the star formation efficiency at $z \sim 12-30$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope continues to push back the redshift frontier to ever earlier cosmic epochs, with recent announcements of galaxy candidates at redshifts of $15 \lesssim z \lesssim 30$. We leverage the recent GUREFT suite of dissipationless $N$-body simulations, which were designed for interpreting observations in the high redshift Universe, and provide predictions of dark matter halo mass functions and halo growth rates for a state-of-the-art cosmology over a wide range of halo masses from $6 &lt; z&lt; 30$. We combine these results with an empirical framework that maps halo growth rate to galaxy star formation rate and then to rest-frame UV luminosity. We find that even if all of the photometrically selected $15 \lesssim z \lesssim 30$ galaxy candidates are real and actually at these extreme redshifts, there is no fundamental tension with $\Lambda$CDM, nor are exotic explanations required. With stellar light-to-mass ratios similar to those in well-studied lower redshift galaxies, our simple model can account for the observed extreme ultra-high redshift populations with star formation efficiencies that peak at values of 20-65 percent. Bursty star formation, or higher light-to-mass ratios such as are expected for lower metallicity stellar populations or a top-heavy Initial Mass Function, would result in even lower required star formation efficiencies, comparable to values predicted by high resolution numerical simulations of high-surface density star forming clouds.</description>

      <title>Mergers all the way down: stellar collisions and kinematics of a dense hierarchically forming massive star cluster in a dwarf starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations indicate that the progenitors of globular clusters (GCs) at high redshifts had high average stellar surface densities above $10^5\, \mathrm{M}_\odot\, \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$. Studies of the internal structure and kinematics of the clusters, however, remain out of reach. Numerical simulations are necessary to decipher the origin of the zoo of spatio-kinematic features found in present-day GCs. Here we study star cluster formation in a star-by-star hydrodynamical simulation of a low-metallicity starburst occurring during a merger of two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. The simulation accounts for the multiphase interstellar medium, stellar radiation, winds and supernovae, and the accurate small-scale gravitational dynamics near massive stars. We also include prescriptions for stellar collisions and tidal disruption events by black holes. Gravitationally bound star clusters up to $\sim2\times10^5\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ form dense with initial half-mass radii of $\sim0.1\unicode{x2013}1\, \mathrm{pc}$. The most massive cluster approaches the observed high-redshift surface densities throughout its hierarchical and dissipative assembly. The cluster also hosts a collisionally growing very massive star of $\sim1000\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ that will eventually collapse, forming an intermediate mass black hole. The assembly leaves an imprint in the spatio-kinematic structure of the cluster. The younger half of stars is more centrally concentrated, rotates faster, and its velocity distribution is more radially biased at outer radii. The older population is more round in shape, rotates slowly, its velocity distribution is isotropic and its velocity dispersion is higher. These results provide a possible explanation for a subset of multiple population features observed in GCs such as NGC 104/47 Tuc.</description>

      <title>DELVE-DEEP Survey: The Faint Satellite System of NGC 55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first comprehensive census of the satellite dwarf galaxies around NGC~55 ($2.1$~Mpc) as a part of the DECam Local Volume Exploration DEEP (DELVE-DEEP) survey. NGC~55 is one of four isolated, Magellanic analogs in the Local Volume around which DELVE-DEEP aims to identify faint dwarfs and other substructures. We employ two complementary detection methods: one targets fully resolved dwarf galaxies by identifying them as stellar over-densities, while the other focuses on semi-resolved dwarf galaxies, detecting them through shredded unresolved light components. As shown through extensive tests with injected galaxies, our search is sensitive to candidates down to $M_V \lesssim -6.6$ and surface brightness $\mu \lesssim 28.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, and $\sim 80\%$ complete down to $M_V \lesssim -7.8$. We do not report any new confirmed satellites beyond two previously known systems, ESO 294-010 and NGC~55-dw1. We construct the satellite luminosity function of NGC~55 and find it to be consistent with the predictions from cosmological simulations. As one of the first complete luminosity functions for a Magellanic analog, our results provide a glimpse of the constraints on low-mass-host satellite populations that will be further explored by upcoming surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Effect of kappa-modified polarization force on Jeans instability in nonthermal EiBI-gravitating dust clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-analytic model is developed to study the effects of kappa-distributed lighter constituents and the associated kappa-modified polarization force on the classical Jeans instability in dust molecular clouds (DMCs). The constitutive electrons and ions are considered to follow a nonthermal kappa-velocity distribution law, while the constitutive massive dust grains are treated as the EiBI-gravitating fluids. A linearized quadratic dispersion relation is derived using spherical normal mode analysis. The resulting dispersion relation and its corresponding modified instability criteria are analyzed in the hydrodynamic and kinetic regimes. The oscillatory and propagating mode characteristics are illustratively analyzed. It is seen that the EiBI gravity introduces a new velocity term in the dispersion relation. In contrast, the nonthermal kappa-distributed constituents significantly enhance the polarization force against their respective Maxwellian counterparts. The kappa-modified polarization force and the negative EiBI gravity parameter have destabilizing influences, unlike the positive EiBI parameter. An enhanced polarization interaction parameter and a positive EiBI parameter reduce the real normalized frequency. Consequently, the phase velocity exhibits strong dispersion, increasing with wavenumber until reaching saturation, after which it transitions into a weakly dispersive regime. These findings provide new insights into the formation of smaller astrophysical structures via the non-local Jeans instability in the ultracompact HII regions of dense DMCs.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Lyman Continuum Emission of Ion3: Insights from HST multi-band imaging and X-Shooter spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of Ion3, the most distant LyC leaker at $z=3.999$, using multi-band HST photometry and X-Shooter spectroscopy. Deep HST F390W imaging probe uncontaminated LyC flux blueward $\sim$880{\AA}, while the non-ionizing UV 1500\AA/2800\AA~flux is probed with the F814W/F140W band. High angular resolution allows us to properly mask low-$z$ interlopers and prevent contamination of measured LyC radiation. We confirm the detection of LyC flux at SNR $\sim$3.5 and estimate the escape fraction of ionizing photons to be in the range $f_{\rm esc, rel}$ = 0.06 -- 1, depending on the adopted IGM attenuation. Morphological analysis reveals a clumpy structure made of two main components, with effective radii of R$_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$180 pc and R$_{\rm eff}$ &lt; 100 pc, and a total estimated de-lensed area in the rest-frame 1600\AA~of 4.2~kpc$^{2}$. We confirm the presence of faint ultraviolet spectral features HeII$\lambda$1640, CIII]$\lambda$1907,1909 and [NeIII]$\lambda$3968, with rest-frame EW(HeII) = (1.6$\pm$0.7)\AA\ and EW(CIII]) = (6.5$\pm$3)\AA. From [OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726,3729 and [CIII]$\lambda$1909/CIII]$\lambda$1906 we derive electron densities $n_{\rm e}^{\rm [OII]}$ = 2300$\pm$1900 cm$^{-3}$ and $n_{\rm e}^{\rm CIII]}$ &gt; 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, corresponding to an ISM pressure log(P/k) &gt; 7.90. Furthermore, we derive an intrinsic SFR(H$\alpha$) $\approx$ 77 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (corresponding to $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} = 20$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$ for the entire galaxy) and sub-solar metallicity $12+\rm log(O/H)$ = 8.02$\pm$0.20 using the EW(CIII]) as a diagnostic. The detection of [NeIII]$\lambda$3968 line and [OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726,3729, provide an estimate of the ratio [OIII]$\lambda$5007/[OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3727,29 of O32 &gt; 50 and high ionization parameter log$U$ &gt; $-$1.5 using empirical and theoretical correlations.</description>

      <title>LBT IR observations of candidate super-Eddington quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars accreting at very high rates are believed to be prime movers of galactic evolution because of their high radiative and mechanical output. The study presented in this paper investigates a sample of six highly accreting quasars at redshifts \( z = 2-3 \) using near-infrared observations from the LUCI spectrograph at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The aim is obtain a precise measure of the quasar systemic redshift and accretion parameters (black hole mass and Eddington ratio) primarily from the \hb\ line, \ and on second stance from other intermediate and low ionization lines. Outflow dynamical parameters (mass rate of outflowing gas, its kinetic power and momentum rate) were estimated from the \civ\ emission line that is perhaps the most easily accessible tracer of high-ionization winds from the accretion disk, obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In addition, the joint analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra allowed us to estimate the chemical composition of the broad line emitting gas. The high metal content of the outflowing gas ($Z \gtrsim 10 Z_\odot$) and the high values of thrust and kinetic power may induce a chemical feedback effect in the quasar host, in addition to mechanical feedback.</description>

      <title>Unmasking the physical information inherent to interstellar spectral line profiles with Machine Learning. I. Application of LTE to HCN and HNC transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical and chemical conditions (kinetic temperature, volume density, molecular composition) of interstellar clouds are inherent in their mm-submm line spectra, making spectral line profiles powerful diagnostics of source conditions. We introduce a novel bottom-up approach employing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to directly infer physical conditions from line profiles without using radiative transfer equations. We simulated HCN and HNC emission under representative dense molecular cloud and star-forming region conditions across five rotational transitions (J=1-0 to J=5-4) within 30-500 GHz. The generated data cloud was parameterized using line intensities and widths to infer the physical conditions of the analyzed regions. Three ML algorithms were trained, tested, and compared to unravel the excitation conditions of HCN and HNC and their abundance ratio. ML results obtained with two spectral lines, one for each isomer, were compared with a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) analysis for the cold source R CrA IRS 7B, yielding excitation temperatures and relative abundances in agreement with LTE. The optimized pipeline (training, testing, and prediction) can predict interstellar cloud properties from line profile inputs at lower computational cost than traditional methods. This work represents the first mapping of spectral line profiles to physical conditions by charting isomer abundance ratios and excitation temperatures. Our bottom-up approach, based on simulated and semiempirical spectra, offers a new tool to interpret line observations and estimate interstellar conditions using ML methods.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Distribution in M31 and M33 Based on the Tip-RGB Near-infrared Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the metallicity distribution in M31 and M33 by using the near-infrared color index $J-K$ of tip-red-giant-branch (TRGB) of the member stars from \cite{2021ApJ...907...18R} after removing the foreground dwarf stars by the near-infrared $J-H/H-K$ diagram as well as the Gaia astrometric measurements. We employ the Voronoi binning technique to divide the galaxy into sub-regions, the PN method to determine the TRGB position in the $J-K$/$K$ diagram, and the bootstrap method to estimate the uncertainties. The TRGB positions are calculated to be $J-K = 1.195 \pm 0.002$ and $1.100 \pm 0.003$, and $K = 17.615 \pm 0.007$ and $18.185 \pm 0.053$ for M31 and M33 respectively as an entity, consistent with previous results. The $J-K$ gradient of M31 is found to be $-$0.0055 kpc$^{-1}$ at $R_{\rm GC}=(0, 24)$ kpc and $-$0.0002 kpc$^{-1}$ at $R_{\rm GC}=(24, 150)$ kpc. Notably, two dust rings are evident at 11.5 kpc and 14.5 kpc, in agreement with previous studies. The $J-K$ of M33 is analyzed in four directions and generally shows a trend of gradually decreasing from the inside to the outside, however, it shows an increasing trend of 0.022 kpc$^{-1}$ in the inner 0$-$2 kpc in the west. Through the color$-$metallicity relation of TRGB, the metallicity gradient of M31 turns to be $-0.040 \pm 0.0012$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}&lt;30$ kpc and $-0.001 \pm 0.0002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}&gt;30$ kpc, and for M33, $-$0.269 $\pm$ 0.0206 dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}&lt;9$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Potential-Driven Metal Cycling: JADES Census of Gas-Phase Metallicity for galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational potential is established as a critical determinant of gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H)) in low-redshift galaxies, whereas its influence remains unconfirmed at high redshifts. We investigate the correlation between gas-phase metallicity and effective radius ($R_{\rm e}$) for a sample of galaxies with redshifts ranging from 1 to 7, drawn from JADES (JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey) Data Release 3. We calculate the metallicities using four strong-line methods: ${\rm N2S2H\alpha}$, ${\rm R23}$, ${\rm N2}$, and ${\rm O3N2}$, respectively. After taking out the evolution of size, we find that the offsets of mass-size relation ($\Delta \log R_{\rm e}$) are significantly negatively correlated with the offset of mass-metallicity relation ($\Delta \log({\rm O/H})$) for the four metallicity tracers. Regardless of the metallicity tracer used, we obtain Spearman rank $p-$values much less than 0.01, rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is statistically nonsignificant and attributable to random chance. This is also true for galaxies with $z&gt;3$, with $p-$values less than 0.05 for the four metallicity tracers. We for the first time find evidence of size playing a key role in determining gas-phase metallicity towards cosmic dawn, suggesting that the gravitational potential influences their material-exchange processes with the surrounding environment at very early universe.</description>

      <title>Dependence of 4000\AA~ break strength on narrow emission line properties in local Type-2 AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we report evidence to support the dependence of D{\it n}4000 (4000\AA~ break strength to trace stellar ages) on central AGN activity traced by narrow emission line properties in local Type-2 AGN in SDSS DR16. Based on the measured D{\it n}4000 and flux ratios of [O~{\sc iii}] to narrow H$\beta$ (O3HB) and [N~{\sc ii}] to narrow H$\alpha$ (N2HA) and narrow H$\alpha$ line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}$, linear dependence of the D{\it n}4000 on the O3HB, N2HA and $L_{H\alpha}$ in the local Type-2 AGN can provide clues to support the dependence of D{\it n}4000 on properties of narrow emission lines. Linear correlations between the D{\it n}4000 and the O3HB and N2HA can be found in the local Type-2 AGN, with Spearman rank correlations about -0.39 and 0.53. Meanwhile, stronger dependence of the D{\it n}4000 on the $L_{H\alpha}$ can be confirmed in Type-2 AGN, with Spearman rank correlation coefficient about -0.7. Moreover, combining the $L_{H\alpha}$ and the N2HA, a more robust and stronger linear correlation can be confirmed between the D{\it n}4000 and the new parameter $LR=0.2\log(L_{H\alpha})-0.5\log(\rm N2HA)$, with Spearman rank correlation coefficient about -0.76 and with smaller RMS scatters. After considering necessary effects, the dependence of D{\it n}4000 on $LR$ is stable and robust enough for the local Type-2 AGN, indicating the $LR$ on the narrow emission lines can be treated as a better indicator to statistically trace stellar ages of samples of more luminous AGN with weaker host galaxy absorption features.</description>

      <title>The interplay between Active Galactic Nuclei and Ram-pressure stripping: spatially resolved gas-phase abundances of stripped and undisturbed galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-phase oxygen abundance of the circumnuclear regions around supermassive black holes (SMBH) has been claimed to be affected by the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). However, there is currently no consensus on the mechanism driving this effect. In this work, we explore whether the interplay between AGN activity and the Ram Pressure Stripping (RPS) can influence the metallicity distributions of nearby (z &lt; 0.07) galaxies. To this aim, we measure the spatially resolved gas-phase oxygen abundances of 10 stripped AGN hosts from the GASP survey, as well as 52 AGN hosts found in the field, which are undisturbed by the effects of ram pressure, drawn from the MaNGA DR15. We find that the metal distributions in these two samples do not differ significantly. Only 2 out of the 10 RP-stripped AGNs present lower oxygen abundances at any given radius than the rest of the AGN sample. Overall, this result highlights that the AGN-RPS interplay does not play a significant role in shaping the metallicity distributions of stripped galaxies within 1.5 times the galaxy's effective radius (r &lt; 1.5 Re). However, larger samples are required to draw more definitive conclusions. By including a control sample of SF galaxies, we observe that the AGN hosts are more metal-enriched than SF galaxies at any given radius. More than that, the steepness of the gradients in the nuclear regions (r &lt; 0.5 Re) is greater in AGN hosts than in SF galaxies. These results favor the hypothesis that the AGN activity is causing metal pollution in the galaxy's nuclear regions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction for circular orbits in self-interacting ultralight dark matter and Fornax globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of repulsive self-interaction in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on dynamical friction in circular orbits in ULDM halos and its implications for the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globular clusters. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we derive the dynamical friction force considering soliton density profiles for both non-interacting and strongly self-interacting ULDM. Our results show that self-interactions reduce the dynamical friction effect further than both the non-interacting ULDM and standard cold dark matter models. Furthermore, we derive the low Mach number approximation to simplify the analysis in the subsonic motion, where the tangential component of dynamical friction dominates. Applying these findings to the Fornax dSph, we calculate the infall timescales of globular clusters, demonstrating that strong self-interaction can address the timing problem more effectively. We constrain the parameter space for ULDM particle mass and self-coupling constant, which are consistent with other constraints from astronomical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>A novel sub-grid model for super-Eddington accretion of spinning black holes in galaxy-scale simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion has been proposed to explain the existence of black holes (BHs) with masses exceeding a billion solar masses within the first billion years after the Big Bang. We present a novel accretion disc-based sub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime, implemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH is mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping region described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin $\alpha$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin evolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect and inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a suite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc and a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under which super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a realistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an initially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by the rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. Mildly super-Eddington accretion can also be maintained when the BH is misaligned with the disc, as the Lense-Thirring effect reduces the disc angular momentum. These results highlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling super-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to trigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a condition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially provides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain the bright high-redshift quasars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Catastrophically Disrupted Open Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the many discoveries uncovered by the Gaia astrometric mission, some of the most exciting are related to nearby dispersed stellar structures. We analyze one such structure in the Milky Way disk, OCSN-49, a coeval stellar stream with 257 identified members spanning approximately 30$^\circ$ across the sky. We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic data for four members that span the stream's extent, finding these four stars to have solar metallicities and remarkably homogeneous chemistry. Through a combination of isochrone fitting, lithium abundance analysis, and gyrochronology, we find a consistent stellar age of 400--600 Myr. Integrating stellar orbits backwards reveals that OCSN-49 converged to a single point at a much younger age. By integrating unbound model stars forward and comparing them to the current phase-space distribution of OCSN-49, we derive a dynamical age of 83$\pm$1 Myr, inconsistent with the age of the stellar population. The discrepancy between the kinematic and stellar age indicators is naturally explained by a disruptive event that unbound OCSN-49 roughly 500 Myr into its lifetime. Based on rate estimates, disruption due to a passing giant molecular cloud (GMC) is the most likely culprit. Assuming a single encounter, we find that a nearly head-on collision with a fairly massive GMC ($\sim$10$^5$ M$_\odot$) was necessary to unbind the cluster, although encounters with multiple GMCs may be responsible. To our knowledge, OCSN-49 serves as the first known remnant of a catastrophically disrupted open cluster and therefore serves as a benchmark for further investigating cluster disruption in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Disk winds spectral energy distribution and the variability timescale of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disk winds are commonly observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The winds may be associated with the changing spectral properties of such sources, yet such connections have not been studied in detail so far. This paper presents detailed calculations of accretion disk winds and their impact on the observed spectrum of AGN, emphasizing recent observations of Mrk 817. The model consists of a radial and time-dependent mass outflow rate with a half-ejection radius of 50Rg and a variability timescale of 100 days. The resulting spectral energy distribution (SED) is characterized by a large drop in the ionizing luminosity and less significant changes in the optical luminosity. The time-dependent intensities of the broad emission lines and the spectrum emitted by the wind material reflect these variations. For Mrk 817, the variability timescale of the 1500-5500A continuum, the thermal time of the disk at the locations where most of this radiation is emitted, and the range of radii over which most of the mass outflow is taking place are all in agreement with the black hole mass and the radial-dependent accretion rate through the disk. This suggests a general connection between time-dependent disk winds, SED shape, thermal timescale, and optical-UV variability in AGN.</description>

      <title>Morphological Feature Distances Among the Spectral Types of SDSS Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the morphological feature distances among various spectral types of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including strong and weak Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO), quiescent, and star-forming galaxies. We evaluated the clustering and relative distances of these spectral types in the multidimensional morphological feature space. The results indicate that AGN and QSOs are more closely associated with quiescent galaxies than with star-forming ones, indicating a potential regulation of star formation by AGN activity. Furthermore, the analysis underlines the role of AGN feedback in the dwarf regime having $\sim$10~50% closer distances from AGN types to the quiescent type than to the SF type in the dwarf regime $-18 &gt; M_r &gt; -20$, compared to $&lt;$15% closer in the massive regime $M_r &lt; -21$. The continuous probability analysis for being Hubble types of the spectral types upholds the distance analysis results having a range of the probability distribution of AGN types similar to quiescent type, especially in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Star Formation Rate and Dust Attenuation of Nearby Galaxies from CALIFA, GALEX, and WISE Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study star formation rate (SFR) indicators and dust attenuation of 74 nearby star-forming galaxies on kiloparsec scales, based on GALEX far-ultraviolet (FUV) and WISE mid-infrared (MIR) images with CALIFA optical integral field spectroscopic data. We obtain hybrid SFR indicators by combining the observed FUV and MIR luminosities and calibrate them using the dust-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity as a reference SFR. The simple linear combination appears to follow well the reference SFR, but the calibration residual shows a significant dependence on the specific SFR (sSFR), which can be removed by employing the combination coefficient or conversion offset that varies with the sSFR. In the plane of gas versus stellar attenuation, the median trend line's slope ($\approx$ stellar-to-gas attenuation ratio) changes from 0.44 to 1.0 with increasing attenuation. The differential attenuation, defined as the deviation of stellar attenuation from the median trend line, is strongly correlated with the SFR surface density and sSFR, compatible with the two-component dust model. The differential attenuation seems to be affected by both local and global factors.</description>

      <title>Precision Determination of Scintillation Screen Parameters from Annual Modulation Measurement of Pulsar Scintillation Arc Curvature with the FAST Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar scintillation observations have revealed ubiquitous discrete scintillation screens in the interstellar medium. A major obstacle in identifying the nature of these screens is the uncertainty in their distances, which prevents precise correlation with known structures in the Milky Way. We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe PSR B1237+25, PSR 1842+14, and PSR 2021+51. We detected 10 scintillation arcs in PSR B1237+25, 1 in PSR 1842+14, and at least 6 in PSR 2021+51. By modeling the annual modulation of these scintillation arcs, we constrained the distances of the scintillation screens, as well as the anisotropic scattering directions and the projected velocities in those directions. The scintillation screens are distributed throughout the entire paths between Earth and the pulsars. Among these, the distance to the main scintillation screen toward PSR B1237+25 is $267^{+32}_{-28}$ pc, the scintillation screen toward PSR B1842+14 is at a distance of $240^{+210}_{-120}$ pc, and the main scintillation screen toward PSR B2021+51 is located at $887^{+167}_{-132}$ pc. Several screens in our sample appear at distances coinciding with the Local Bubble boundary, particularly the brightest scintillation arc toward PSR B1237+25. We provide a substantial sample of scintillation screen measurements, revealing the rich plasma density fluctuation structures present in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>CGM cloud sizes from refractive FRB scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore constraints on the size of cool gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtainable from the presence, or lack thereof, of refractive scattering in fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our refractive analysis sets the most conservative bounds on parsec-scale CGM clumpiness as it does not make assumptions about the turbulent density cascade. We find that the bulk of low-redshift cool CGM gas, constrained to have densities of $n_{\rm e} \lesssim 10^{-2}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, likely cannot produce two refractive images and, hence, scattering. It is only for extremely small cloud sizes $\lesssim 0.1$ pc (about a hundred times smaller than the so-called shattering scale) that such densities could result in detectable scattering. Dense $n_{\rm e} \gtrsim 0.1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ gas with shattering-scale cloud sizes is more likely to inhabit the inner several kiloparsecs of the low-redshift CGM: such clouds would result in multiple refractive images and large scattering times $\gtrsim 1 - 10$ ms, but a small fraction FRB sightlines are likely to be affected. We argue that such large scattering times from an intervening CGM would be a signature of sub-parsec clouds, even if diffractive scattering from turbulence contributes to the overall scattering. At redshift $z\sim 3$, we estimate $\sim 0.1\%$ of FRBs to intersect massive proto-clusters, which may be the most likely place to see scattering owing to their ubiquitous $n_{\rm e} \approx 1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ cold gas. While much of our discussion assumes a single cloud size, we show similar results hold for a CGM cloud-size distribution motivated by hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Complex Organic Molecules towards the central molecular zone of NGC 253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) may have a link to prebiotic species, key building blocks for life. In Galactic star-forming (SF) regions, spatial variations of iCOMs emission could reflect the source physical structure or different chemical formation pathways. Investigating iCOMs in extragalactic SF regions may thus provide crucial information about these regions. As an active extragalactic SF region, the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the nearby galaxy NGC 253 provides an ideal template for studying iCOMs under more extreme conditions. We aim to investigate the emission of a few selected iCOMs and understand if a difference between the iCOMs could reflect on the source's chemical or physical structure. Using the high angular resolution ($\sim 27$ pc) observations from the ALCHEMI ALMA large program, we imaged the emission of selected iCOMs and precursors; CH$_3$CHO, C$_2$H$_5$OH, NH$_2$CHO, CH$_2$NH, and CH$_3$NH$_2$. We estimated the iCOMs gas temperatures and column densities using a rotational diagram analysis, and by performing a non-LTE analysis for CH$_2$NH.The iCOM emission concentrates mostly towards the inner part of the CMZ of NGC 253 and can be reproduced with two gas components. Different emission processes can explain iCOM emission towards the CMZ of NGC 253: at Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) scales ($\sim 27$ pc), the iCOMs could trace large-scale shocks whilst at smaller scales (few pc), both shock and heating processes linked with ongoing star formation may be involved. Using column density correlation trends and known formation pathways, we find that more than one formation path could be involved to explain the iCOM emission. Finally, we found chemical differences between the GMCs, such as a decrease of abundance for the N-bearing species towards one of the GMCs or different excitation conditions for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_3$CHO towards two of the GMCs.</description>

      <title>On the unique evolutionary mechanisms of massive quiescent galaxies in the epoch of reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolutionary histories of a population of high mass, high redshift, quiescent galaxies in the cosmohydrodynamical simulation Thesan; studying the characteristic properties of their haloes and environments over the epoch of reionisation. Thesan employs a modified version of the Arepo moving-mesh code utilised in IllustrisTNG, whose explicit handling of ionising radiation couples haloes and galaxies with cosmic reionisation. This results in a regime of rapid growth and quenching, producing nine massive quiescent galaxies at $z = 5.5$, in a $95.5\text{cMpc}^3$ volume, with no counterpart in IllustrisTNG. We find that the rapid assembly of stellar mass is attributed to smooth accretion of mass onto their haloes in dense environments, particularly from massive neighbouring structures; while these galaxies exhibit fast-growing potential wells hosting massive central black holes. With insignificant merger activity, we find AGN feedback to be the primary source of quenching. We find megaparsec-scale densities and halo masses to continue growing after quenching, suggesting that massive quiescent galaxies will be found in some of the largest haloes and densest regions of space by observations. With an unprecedented plethora of massive quiescent galaxies found in JWST data, these reionisation simulations may provide the paradigm for the evolutionary histories of these galaxies, while constraining the relatively unknown physics of reionisation. Despite the rarity of simulated massive quiescent galaxies, their identification in Thesan enables identification of halo and environmental properties most conducive to their quenching, hopefully guiding future efforts into the study of analogous systems in deep observational surveys and large-volume N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Cooling process of the high-mass young stellar object G24.33+0.14 following an accretion burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HMYSO G24.33+0.14 (G24), has recently been observed to undergo an accretion burst since September 2019, lasting approximately two years. By utilizing 1.3 mm observational data from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in March 2020 and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in September 2019, we have examined the physical environment changes in gas and dust within G24 region during the decay phase of the accretion burst. Following the burst, the continuum emission in the inner core region of G24 diminished by approximately 20%, while the emission in the outer region exhibited an increase by a factor of ~30%. This pattern indicates that the heat wave, triggered by the accretion burst, radiated outward from the core's interior to its periphery over the half-year period, with a calculated propagation speed of 0.08-0.38 times the speed of light. Moreover, the methanol emission intensity in this area has experienced a notable decline, with the rate of flux reduction correlating positively with the energy of the upper energy states. This, in conjunction with the analysis of methanol molecular line rotation temperature diagrams for different emitting regions, further substantiates that the core region of G24 cooled down, contrasted with the persistent heating in the outer region following the burst.</description>

      <title>IGR J12580+0134: The Nearest Tidal Disruption Event and its Faint Resurrection</title>

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are X-ray and gamma-ray radiations emerging from the tidal disintegration of a star or substellar object that passes too close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy. In November 2010, a TDE designated as IGR J12580+0134 occurred in the galaxy NGC 4845, which was traced by follow-up XMM-Newton observations in January 2011. To identify a further TDE based on the radio outburst cycle, we requested NICER monitoring observations for nearly a year beginning in March 2023, which we studied here along with the previous XMM-Newton observations. We analyzed X-ray brightness changes using hardness analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), and conducted spectral analysis of the source continuum. The NICER observations revealed the presence of some X-ray flares during March--June 2023, which were much fainter than the TDE observed using XMM-Newton in 2011. The PCA component that mainly contributes to the X-ray outbursts during the TDE is a heavily absorbed power-law continuum emission, whereas there is a small contribution from collisionally ionized plasma in the soft excess, likely from a colliding wind or jet. Similarly, the PCA of the NICER data relates the X-ray flares to a power-law spectrum, albeit with a much lower absorbing column, and partially to soft collisional plasma. The faint X-ray flares captured by NICER could be associated with extremely weak accretion onto the SMBH resident in this galaxy, and thus, potentially a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>Repeated Tidal Interactions between Stars and Supermassive Black Holes: Mass Transfer, Stability, and Implications for Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars orbiting supermassive black holes can generate recurring accretion flares in repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we develop an efficient formalism for analyzing the time-dependent response of a star to the removal of a fraction ($\lesssim 10\%$) of its mass. This model predicts that mass loss results in a decrease in the average density of low-mass ($\lesssim 0.7 M_{\odot}$) stars. Contrarily, higher-mass stars increase in density, such that the change is more pronounced for larger mass losses, and stars with masses $\sim 1.5-2 M_{\odot}$ experience the largest such increase. We predict that the final energy of the star post-mass-loss (i.e., the ``surviving core'') is effectively given by the binding energy of the original star interior to the radius from which mass is removed, i.e., the final core energy is agnostic to the process that removes the mass and -- as a corollary -- tidal heating is comparatively insignificant. We find excellent agreement between our predictions and one-dimensional Eulerian simulations of a star undergoing mass loss, and three-dimensional Lagrangian simulations of partial TDEs. We conclude that 1) partially disrupted stars are not significantly heated via tidal dissipation, 2) evolved and moderately massive ($\gtrsim 1.5 M_{\odot}$) stars can most readily survive many repeated stripping events, and 3) progressively dimmer flares -- observed in some repeating partial TDE candidates -- could be explained by the increase in the density of the star post-mass-loss.</description>

      <title>Constraining Population III stellar demographics with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>

Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>

      <title>The impact of wind mass loss on nucleosynthesis and yields of very massive stars at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical feedback from stellar winds in low metallicity (Z) environments is key for understanding the evolution of globular clusters and the early Universe. With disproportionate mass lost from the most massive stars (M &gt; 100Msun), and an excess of such stars expected at the lowest metallicities, their contribution to the enrichment of the early pristine clusters could be significant. In this work, we examine the effect of mass loss at low metallicity on the nucleosynthesis and wind yields of (very) massive stars. We calculate stellar models with initial masses ranging from 30 to 500Msun during core Hydrogen and Helium burning phases, at four metallicities ranging from 20% Zsun down to 1% Zsun. The ejected masses and net yields are provided for each grid of models. While mass-loss rates decrease with Z, we find that not only are wind yields significant, but the nucleosynthesis is also altered due to the change in central temperatures and therefore also plays a role. We find that 80-300Msun models can produce large quantities of Na-rich and O-poor material, relevant for the observed Na-O anti-correlation in globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Forecasts and Simulations for Relativistic Corrections to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect is a window into the astrophysical processes of galaxy clusters, and relativistic corrections (the "rSZ") promise to provide a global census of the gas feedback within clusters. Upcoming wide-field millimeter-wave surveys such as the Simons Observatory (SO), Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope, and CMB-S4 will make increasingly precise measurements of the SZ effect and its relativistic corrections. We present simulated full-sky maps of the rSZ effect and a fast code to generate it, for use in the development of analysis techniques and pipelines. As part of the websky simulation suite, our mock observations have semi-realistic cross-correlations with other large-scale structure tracers, offering insights into the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters and large-scale structure. As a demonstration of this, we examine what an SO-like experiment can learn from the rSZ effect. We find that high significance detections will be possible, provided that the instrumental systematics are under control, and that the evolution of cluster temperatures with mass and redshift can be probed in a manner complementary to X-ray measurements.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of Metal-Poor Red Giants Observed by TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic archeology has long been limited by a lack of precise masses and ages for metal-poor stars in the Milky Way's thick disk. However, with TESS providing a growing number of photometric observations, it is possible to calculate masses and ages for more solar-like oscillators than ever using asteroseismology. We have used the pySYD pipeline to determine global asteroseismic parameters and calculated the masses and ages of $506$ metal-poor ([M/H] $&lt;$ -0.5) red giants observed by TESS. Our findings appear to show metallicity-dependent mass loss on the upper red giant branch and identify a set of "young" high-$\alpha$ stars that have been detected in other studies. We also find that $32.6\%$ of the metal-poor stars appear to be binary interaction products and four stars with stellar ages that could be from the Gaia Enceladus/Sausage system. In combination with existing ages from Kepler/K2, this data can be compared to galactic evolution models to better determine the formation history of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>High energy extragalactic multimessenger backgrounds from starburst and dead galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starburst galaxies are $\gamma$-ray sources. Canonically, their emission is driven by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) interacting with interstellar gas, forming $\gamma$-rays via the decay of neutral pions. Charged pions are also formed in this process. They decay into secondary leptons, including electrons and neutrinos. Starburst galaxies are therefore also expected to be neutrino sources, and their high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission may include a secondary leptonic component. Leptonic $\gamma$-rays may also originate from electrons directly energized by shocks within the interstellar medium of galaxies, or from pulsars and their surrounding halos. In the Milky Way, pulsars/pulsar halos are the dominant $\gamma$-ray source class. They are associated with stellar remnants or old stellar populations, and are presumably abundant in old galaxies. In this work, we show that the collective high-energy emission from galaxies can account for only a fraction of extragalactic neutrinos, but can form a major component of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. Contrary to the traditional view, a substantial fraction of this radiation may originate from leptonic processes, including from old, quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamical simulations-based model that connects the FRB DM--redshift relation to suppression of the matter power spectrum via feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of baryonic feedback on the small-scale ($k \gtrsim 1\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) matter power spectrum is a key astrophysical challenge, and essential for interpreting data from upcoming weak-lensing surveys, which require percent-level accuracy to fully harness their potential. Astrophysical probes, such as the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, have been used to constrain feedback at large scales ($k \lesssim 5\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$). The sightline-to-sightline variance in the fast radio bursts (FRBs) dispersion measure (DM) correlates with the strength of baryonic feedback and offers unique sensitivity at scales upto $k \sim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. We develop a new simulation-based formalism in which we parameterize the distribution of DM at a given redshift, $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$, as a log-normal with its first two moments computed analytically in terms of cosmological parameters and the feedback-dependent electron power spectrum $P_\mathrm{ee}(k, z)$. We find that the log-normal parameterization provides an improved description of the $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$ distribution observed in hydrodynamical simulations as compared to the standard $F$-parameterization. Our model robustly captures the baryonic feedback effects across a wide range of baryonic feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamical simulations, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Astrid. Leveraging simulations incorporates the redshift evolution of the DM variance by construction and facilitates the translation of constrained feedback parameters to the suppression of matter power spectrum relative to gravity-only simulations. We show that with $10^4$ FRBs, the suppression can be constrained to percent-level precision at large scales and $\sim 10$\% precision at scales $k \gtrsim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ with prior-to-posterior $1\sigma$ constraint width ratio $\gtrsim 20$.</description>

      <title>Flare genesis in relativistic jet: Disentangling the drivers of variability in the blazar 4C +27.50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, blazar 4C +27.50 was found to be flaring in gamma-rays since its detection with Fermi-LAT in 2008. For the first time, a dedicated temporal and spectral study of the blazar 4C +27.50 has been performed in this work to understand the nature of this object. We used the Bayesian block algorithm to identify four flaring states and one quiet state in the 2-year-long Fermi-LAT light curve. Simultaneous broadband flaring episodes have been observed, and a significant correlation is seen between optical and $\gamma$-ray emission, suggesting the co-spatial origin of the broadband emission. The variation of fractional variability amplitude with respect to frequency shows a nearly double hump structure similar to broadband SED. The fastest flux doubling time in the 1-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve is found to be about 7.8 hours. A curvature in $\gamma$-ray spectra has been observed, possibly caused by a stochastic particle acceleration process rather than radiative cooling. No evident correlation was found in the $\gamma$-ray flux-index plot, but a clear harder-when-brighter trend is observed in the X-ray flux-index plot. A one-zone leptonic model has been implemented to understand broadband emission during the quiet and flaring states, and the variation of the jet parameters is been investigated. A gradual increment in BLR and Disk energy density has been observed from a quiet to the flaring state. Broadband SED modeling suggested that an enhancement in the magnetic field, particle energy, and bulk Lorentz factor might have caused the flaring events.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields and black hole mergers with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale (i.e., $\gtrsim {\rm kpc}$) and micro-Gauss scale magnetic fields have been observed throughout the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. These fields depend on the geometry and matter-energy composition, can display complicated behavior such as direction reversals, and are intimately related to the evolution of the source galaxy. Simultaneously, gravitational-wave astronomy offers a new probe into astrophysical systems, for example the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe the mergers of massive (i.e., $M ~&gt; 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$) black-hole binaries and provide extraordinary constraints on the evolution of their galactic hosts. In this work, we show how galactic, large-scale magnetic fields and their electromagnetic signatures are connected with LISA gravitational-wave observations via their common dependence on the massive black-hole binary formation scenario of hierarchical galaxy mergers. Combining existing codes, we astrophysically evolve a population of massive binaries from formation to merger and find that they are detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 10^3$ which is correlated with quantities from the progenitors' phase of circumbinary disk migration such as the maximum magnetic field magnitude $|\mathbf{B}| \approx 7 \,\mu$G, polarized intensity, and Faraday rotation measure. Interesting correlations result between these observables arising from their dependencies on the black-hole binary total mass, suggesting a need for further analyses of the full parameter space. We conclude with a discussion on this new multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Substructures with Free-Form Modelling: A Case Study of the `Jackpot' Strong Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising the population and internal structure of sub-galactic halos is critical for constraining the nature of dark matter. These halos can be detected near galaxies that act as strong gravitational lenses with extended arcs, as they perturb the shapes of the arcs. However, this method is subject to false-positive detections and systematic uncertainties: particularly degeneracies between an individual halo and larger-scale asymmetries in the distribution of lens mass. We present a new free-form lens modelling code, developed within the framework of the open-source software \texttt{PyAutoLens}, to address these challenges. Our method models mass perturbations that cannot be captured by parametric models as pixelized potential corrections and suppresses unphysical solutions via a Mat\'ern regularisation scheme that is inspired by Gaussian process regression. This approach enables the recovery of diverse mass perturbations, including subhalos, line-of-sight halos, external shear, and multipole components that represent the complex angular mass distribution of the lens galaxy, such as boxiness/diskiness. Additionally, our fully Bayesian framework objectively infers hyperparameters associated with the regularisation of pixelized sources and potential corrections, eliminating the need for manual fine-tuning. By applying our code to the well-known `Jackpot' lens system, SLACS0946+1006, we robustly detect a highly concentrated subhalo that challenges the standard cold dark matter model. This study represents the first attempt to independently reveal the mass distribution of a subhalo using a fully free-form approach.</description>

      <title>ExoALMA XIII. gas masses from N2H+ and C18O: a comparison of protoplanetary gas disk mass measurement techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas masses of protoplanetary disks are important but elusive quantities. In this work we present new ALMA observations of N2H+ (3-2) for 11 exoALMA disks. N2H+ is a molecule sensitive to CO freeze-out and has recently been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of gas masses estimated from CO line emission. We combine these new observations with archival N2H+ and CO isotopologue observations to measure gas masses for 19 disks, predominantly from the exoALMA Large program. For 15 of these disks the gas mass has also been measured using gas rotation curves. We show that the CO + N2H+ line emission-based gas masses typically agree with the kinematically measured ones within a factor 3 (1-2{\sigma}). Gas disk masses from CO + N2H+ are on average a factor 2.3(+0.7,-1.0) x lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could suggest slightly lower N2 abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates than typically assumed. Herbig disks are found to have ISM level CO gas abundances based on their CO and N2H+ fluxes, which sets them apart from T-Tauri disks where abundances are typically 3-30x lower. The agreement between CO + N2H+ -based and kinematically measured gas masses is promising and shows that multi-molecule line fluxes are a robust tool to accurately measure disk masses at least for extended disks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ultralight Dark Matter Self-Coupling via the Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary mergers serve as prominent sources of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). If dark matter-induced friction is present in the vicinity of these mergers, it can lead to suppression in the nanohertz frequency range of the SGWB spectrum. In particular, ultralight dark matter (ULDM) forming compact solitonic cores around supermassive black holes can imprint signatures in PTA observations. Our analysis places limits on the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, demonstrating that soliton-induced dynamical friction can significantly alter the SGWB spectrum. PTAs have the potential to exclude certain ULDM mass ranges while probing the effects of self-interactions, offering a novel avenue to investigate the fundamental properties of ULDM.</description>

      <title>What Determines the Maximum Mass of AGN-assisted Black Hole Mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of merging binary black holes detected through gravitational waves remains a fundamental question in astrophysics. While stellar evolution imposes an upper mass limit of about 50 solar mass for black holes, some observed mergers--most notably GW190521--involve significantly more massive components, suggesting alternative formation channels. Here we investigate how heavy black holes merging within Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) disks can become. Using a comprehensive semi-analytic model incorporating 27 binary and environmental parameters, we explore the role of AGN disk conditions in shaping the upper end of the black hole mass spectrum. We find that AGN disk lifetime is the dominant factor, with high-mass mergers (&gt;200 solar mass) only possible if disks persist for ~40 Myr. The joint electromagnetic observation of an AGN-assisted merger could therefore lead to a direct measurement of the age of an AGN disk.</description>

      <title>Latest developments in wide-field VLBI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) combines the signals of telescopes distributed across thousands of kilometres to provide some of the highest angular resolution images of astrophysical phenomena. Due to computational expense, typical VLBI observations are restricted to a single target and a small (few arcseconds) field-of-view per pointing. The technique of wide-field VLBI was born to enable the targeting of multiple sources and has been successful in providing new insights into Active Galactic Nuclei, the interstellar medium, supernovae, gravitational lenses and much more. However, this technique is still only employed in a few experiments, restricting the scientific potential of VLBI observations. In this conference proceeding, we outline new developments in wide-field VLBI, including an end-to-end correlation and calibration workflow, distributed correlation, and new calibration routines. These developments aim to enable wide-field VLBI to be a standard observing mode on all major VLBI arrays.</description>

      <title>Exploring circumstellar chemistry in X-ray emitting AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry and physical conditions of the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) binary candidate stars with UV-excess and X-ray emission, in particular, to identify the effects of the internal X-ray emission in the abundance of certain key molecules. Methods. We observed the 86.0-94.0 and 260.0-272.5 GHz spectral ranges searching for rotational transitions of the X-ray sensitive molecule $HCO^{+}$ in four AGB stars, two of them detected in both UV and X-ray emission and the other two detected only in UV. We derived the CSEs's physical parameters from previous CO observations and determined the molecular abundances of the detected species using radiative transfer models. We developed chemical kinetics models that account for the effects of internal X-ray emission (as well as UV radiation) and compared our predictions with observations. Results. We report the detection of $HCO^{+}$ in the X-ray emitting C-rich AGB T\,Dra, while it remains undetected in the spectra of the other three sources. In T\,Dra we also detect SiO, HCN, HNC, $HC_{3}N$, $SiC_{2}$, $C_{2}H$ and SiS. For the other targets only HCN and SiO are detected. The high fractional abundance of $HCO^{+}$ derived for T\,Dra ($[1.5-3.0]\times 10^{-8}$) is in good agreement with the predictions from our chemical kinetics models including the effects of internal X-ray emission, and one order of magnitude higher than the values expected for C-rich AGB stars. Additionally, we identify abundance enhancements for HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ alongside a depletion of CO in the innermost regions of T\,Dra's envelope. Conclusions. An internal X-ray source can significantly alter molecular abundances in AGB CSEs, enhancing $HCO^{+}$, $N_{2}H^{+}$, HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ while depleting parent species like CO. UV radiation has a weaker effect unless the envelope is optically thin or porous.</description>

      <title>Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars: spectral library, metallicities and abundances of $\alpha$ and Fe-peak elements of the third version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of chemical abundances in stars plays a pivotal role in understanding stellar structure and evolution, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. Benchmark stars with precise and accurate atmospheric parameters and abundances are indispensable for calibrating spectroscopic surveys and testing stellar atmosphere models. This study focuses on the compilation of high-quality spectra and the determination of LTE chemical abundances of iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements for the third version of the Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars (GBSv3). We compiled spectra of the GBSv3 from public archives and complemented these with our own observations. We use fundamental atmospheric parameters from Soubiran et al. 2024 to derive the chemical abundances and perform a spectroscopic analysis using the public code iSpec. We compile a homogeneous spectral library of high-resolution (42,000) and high signal-to-noise ($&gt;100$) normalised spectra for 202 stars: including the 192 GBSv3, 9 stars with indirect measurement of the angular diameter from previous GBS versions, and the Sun. Using four radiative transfer codes, we derive chemical abundances of 13 chemical species (Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I). We make an in-depth study of several sources of error. The GBSv3 contributes to the legacy samples of spectroscopic reference stars with improved statistics and homogeneity. The compiled high-resolution spectral library and the determination of abundances for iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements, together with an extensive discussion of the linked uncertainties, provides a sample of reference abundances to the community.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Period-Luminosity Relations of delta Scuti Stars: A Pathway to Distance and 3-D Dust Map Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While delta Scuti stars are the most numerous class of kappa-mechanism pulsators in the instability strip, the short periods and small peak-to-peak amplitudes have left them understudied and underutilized. Recently, large-scale time-domain surveys have significantly increased the number of identified delta Scuti stars. Notably, the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), with its high-cadence observations at 1-minute intervals, has identified thousands of delta Scuti stars, greatly expanding the sample of these short-period pulsating variables. Using the delta Scuti stars from the TMTS catalogs of Periodic Variable Stars, we cross-matched the dataset with Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE to obtain photometric measurements across optical and infrared bands. Parallax data, used as Bayesian priors, were retrieved from Gaia DR3, and line-of-sight dust extinction priors were estimated from a three-dimensional dust map. Using PyMC, we performed a simultaneous determination of the 11-band P-L relations of delta Scuti stars, which not only yields precise measurements of these relations, but also greatly improves constraints on the distance moduli and color excesses, as evidenced by the reduced uncertainties in the posterior distributions. Furthermore, our methodology enables an independent estimation of the color excess through the P-L relations, offering a potential complement to existing 3-D dust maps. Moreover, by cross-matching with LAMOST DR7, we investigated the influence of metallicity on the P-L relations. Our analysis reveals that incorporating metallicity might reduce the intrinsic scatter at longer wavelengths. However, this result does not achieve 3 sigma significance, leaving open the possibility that the observed reduction is attributable to statistical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>DUETS: Setting expectations for asteroseismic binaries and binary products with synthetic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology gives us the opportunity to better characterize binaries and their products, and shed light on their role in Galactic populations. We estimate occurrence rates, mass distributions, and evolutionary states of asteroseismic binaries, exhibiting solar-like oscillations from both components, and of products of binary interactions with detectable solar-like oscillations. Additionally, we explore the effects of mass accretion or loss on apparent age-metallicity relations. Using the TRILEGAL code, we simulate Kepler's field of view adopting the Eggleton and Moe &amp; Di Stefano distributions of initial binary parameters, and run an additional simulation with non-interacting binaries for comparison. We find that asteroseismic binaries require an initial mass ratio close to one, and even small mass transfer events can prevent the detection of oscillations from both components. The fraction of asteroseismic binaries for red giant stars with detectable oscillations ranges from 0.5\% for non-interacting binaries to a minimum of 0.06% when taking interactions into account. Moreover, asteroseismic binaries composed of two red clump stars are not expected at separations $\leq 500~\text{R}_\odot$ due to the interplay of stellar evolution and binary interactions. Finally, we estimate that at least ~1% of the Kepler red giants with detectable oscillations have undergone significant mass accretion or loss, potentially affecting Galactic age-metallicity relations, although there is a strong dependence on the assumed initial binary parameters. Comparing predicted and observed asteroseismic binaries, as well as over- and under-massive stars, offers a way to constrain key binary evolution assumptions, and to reduce uncertainties in mass-transfer modeling.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of stacked samples of asymmetric, non-static, self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to explore biases that arise in dynamical estimates of the mean mass profile for a collection of galaxy clusters that have been stacked to make a composite. There are three types of bias. One arises from anisotropy of the kinematic pressure tensor and has been already well studied; a second arises from departures from equilibrium; and a third arises because of heterogeneity of the clusters used, from their individual non-sphericity, and because velocities used are measured with respect to centres that are, in general, accelerating. Here we focus on the latter two. We stack clusters to measure the pressure tensor and density profiles and then estimate the dynamical mass profile using the Jeans equation, and compare to the actual mean mass profile. The main result of this paper is an estimate of the bias, that can be used to correct the dynamical mass estimate, and we show how it depends on the cluster sample selection. We find that Jeans equation typically overestimates the true mass by about 20\% at the virial radius.</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH}$ of DM in the range $10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 \,M_{\odot})^{-0.09} &lt; f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 8.7\times 10^{-3} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4\, M_{\odot})^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Subtleties in the Scaling of the 'Terminal Momentum' For Galaxy Formation Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In galaxy formation simulations, it is increasingly common to represent supernovae (SNe) at finite resolution (when the Sedov-Taylor phase is unresolved) via hybrid energy-momentum coupling with some 'terminal momentum' $p_{\rm term}$ (depending weakly on ambient density and metallicity) that represents unresolved work from an energy-conserving phase. Numerical implementations can ensure momentum and energy conservation of such methods, but these require that couplings depend on the surrounding gas velocity field (radial velocity $\langle v_{r} \rangle$). This raises the question of whether $p_{\rm term}$ should also be velocity-dependent, which we explore analytically and in simulations. We show that for simple spherical models, the dependence of $p_{\rm term}$ on $\langle v_{r} \rangle$ introduces negligible corrections beyond those already imposed by energy conservation if $\langle v_{r} \rangle \ge 0$. However, for SNe in some net converging flow ($\langle v_{r} \rangle&lt;0$), naively coupling the total momentum when a blastwave reaches the standard cooling/snowplow phase (or some effective cooling time/velocity/temperature criterion) leads to enormous $p_{\rm term}$ and potentially pathological behaviors. We propose an alternative $\Delta$-Momentum formulation which represents the differential SNe effect and show this leads to opposite behavior of $p_{\rm term}$ in this limit. We also consider a more conservative velocity-independent formulation. Testing in numerical simulations, these directly translate to large effects on predicted star formation histories and stellar masses of massive galaxies, explaining differences between some models and motivating further study in idealized simulations.</description>

      <title>Shining a Light on the Connections between Galactic Outflows Seen in Absorption and Emission Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic outflows provide important feedback effects to regulate the evolution of host galaxies. Two primary diagnostics of outflows are broad and/or blueshifted emission and absorption lines. Even though well-established methods exist to analyze these outflow signatures, connections between them are rarely studied and largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct such a study in a sample of 33 low-redshift starburst galaxies. Their UV absorption lines are detected by Hubble Space Telescope, and optical emission lines are observed by Keck or Very Large Telescope. We find outflow properties derived from emission and absorption lines are tightly correlated. These include outflow maximum velocity, line width, and radial extent. On average, in the same galaxy, the maximum velocity and line width of outflows measured from emission lines reach only 60 -- 70% of those from the absorption lines. We also find outflow rates derived from emission lines are consistently lower than those from absorption lines by 0.2 -- 0.5 dex. These findings can be explained by a radial decline in density and a corresponding increase in outflow velocity, combined with the fact that emission line luminosity scales with the square of the density while absorption line depth scales linearly. We test both spherical and bi-conical outflow models, and find the same radial outflow velocity and density distributions can explain the observed correlations. These results provide novel calibration between galactic outflow properties measured from the two diagnostics and underscore the need for high-fidelity UV and optical spectra to accurately assess galactic feedback effects in high-z galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dust Battery: A Novel Mechanism for Seed Magnetic Field Generation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel dust battery mechanism for generating seed magnetic fields in the early universe, in which charged dust grains are radiatively accelerated, inducing strong electric currents that subsequently generate magnetic fields. Our analysis demonstrates that this process is effective even at very low metallicities (approximately $ \sim 10^{-5} Z_\odot$), and capable of producing seed fields with significant amplitudes of $B \sim \rm \mu G$ around luminous sources over timescales of years to Myr and across spatial scales ranging from au to kpc. Crucially, we find that this mechanism is generically $\sim10^8$ times more effective than the radiatively-driven electron battery or Biermann battery in relatively cool gas ($\ll 10^{5}\,$K), including both neutral and ionized gas. Furthermore, our results suggest that, to first order, dissipation effects do not appear to significantly impede this process, and that it can feasibly generate coherent seed fields on macroscopically large ISM scales (much larger than turbulent dissipation scales or electron mean-free-paths in the ISM). These seed fields could then be amplified by subsequent dynamo actions to the observed magnetic fields in galaxies. Additionally, we propose a sub-grid model for integration into cosmological simulations, and the required electric-field expressions for magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-a-cell (MHD-PIC) simulations that explicitly model dust dynamics. Finally, we explore the broad applicability of this mechanism across different scales and conditions, emphasizing its robustness compared to other known battery mechanisms.</description>

      <title>From larger-scale cold-gas angular-momentum environment to galaxy star-formation activeness</title>

Abstract: We study the influence of the ambient large-scale cold-gas vorticity on the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of central galaxies with stellar masses of $10.0&lt;\log\,M_{\ast}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}&lt;11.5$ at $z=0$, using the TNG100 simulation. The cold-gas vorticity defined and calculated for gas with $T_{\rm gas} &lt; 2\times 10^4 \mathrm{K}$ and on scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc can well describe the angular motion of the ambient cold gas. We find crucial evidence for connections between the cold-gas vorticity and star-formation activeness, such that at any given halo mass (particularly below $10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), galaxies living in higher cold-gas vorticity environments are generally less star-forming, regardless of their large-scale environment types (filament or knot), or star formation states (star-forming or quenched). Specifically, at a fixed halo mass scale of $10^{12}-10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, the median sSFR of galaxies living in environments with the top 30\% cold-gas vorticity is $\sim 0.5$ dex below that of galaxies living in environments with the bottom 30\% cold-gas vorticity. At any fixed halo mass scale, cold-gas vorticities around filament galaxies are generally higher than those around knot galaxies, consistent with that filament galaxies have lower sSFRs than knot galaxies. This large-scale cold-gas vorticity is highly connected to the orbital angular momentum of neighboring galaxies up to a distance of $\sim$ 500 kpcs, indicating their common origin and a possible angular momentum inheritance/modulation from the latter to the former. The negative modulation by the environmental vorticity to galaxy star formation is only significantly observed for the cold gas, indicating the unique role of cold-gas angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relation between environment and internal structure of massive elliptical galaxies using strong lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong lensing by massive galaxies probes their mass distribution, thus providing a window to study their internal structure, i.e., the distributions of luminous and dark matter. In this paper, we investigate the relation between the internal structure of massive elliptical galaxies and their environment using a sample of 15 strong lensing systems. We performed lens modeling for them using Lenstronomy and constrained the mass and light distributions of the deflector galaxies. We adopt the local galaxy density as a metric for the environment and test our results against several alternative definitions of it. We robustly find that the centroid offset between the mass and light is not correlated with the local galaxy density. This result supports using centroid offsets as a probe of dark matter theories since the environment's impact on it can be treated as negligible. Although we find a moderate to strong correlation between the position angle offset and the standard definition of the local galaxy density, consistent with previous studies, the correlation becomes weaker for alternative definitions of the local galaxy density. This result weakens the support for interpreting the position angle misalignment as having originated from interaction with the environment. Furthermore, we find the 'residual shear' magnitude in the lens model to be uncorrelated with the local galaxy density, supporting the interpretation of the residual shear originating, in part, from the inadequacy in modeling the angular structure of the lensing galaxy and not solely from the structures present in the environment or along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Local variations of the radial metallicity gradient in a simulated NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue and their implications for (extra-)galactic studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial metallicity gradients are fundamental to understanding galaxy formation and evolution. In our high-resolution simulation of a NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue, we analyze the linearity, scatter, spatial coherence, and age-related variations of metallicity gradients using young stars and gas. While a global linear model generally captures the gradient, it ever so slightly overestimates metallicity in the inner galaxy and underestimates it in the outer regions of our simulated galaxy. Both a quadratic model, showing an initially steeper gradient that smoothly flattens outward, and a piecewise linear model with a break radius around 9.3-11.5~kpc (2.4-3.0 effective radii) fit the data equally better. The spread of [Fe/H] of young stars in the simulation increases by tenfold from the innermost to the outer galaxy at a radius of 20~kpc. We find that stars born at similar times along radial spirals drive this spread in the outer galaxy, with a chemical under- and over-enhancement of up to 0.1 dex at leading and trailing regions of such spirals, respectively. This localised chemical variance highlights the need to examine radial and azimuthal selection effects for both Galactic and extragalactic observational studies. The arguably idealised but volume-complete simulations suggest that future studies should not only test linear and piecewise linear gradients, but also non-linear functions such as quadratic ones to test for a smooth gradient rather than one with a break radius. Either finding would help to determine the importance of different enrichment or mixing pathways and thus our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution scenarios.</description>

      <title>High N/O ratio at high redshift as a result of a strong burst of star formation and differential galactic winds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations by JWST have revealed supersolar $^{14}$N abundances in galaxies at very high redshift. On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for $^{14}$N, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O and $^{56}$Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies ($10^{9}\text{ - }10^{10}\text{ M}_{\odot}$) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.</description>

      <title>Detection of Anisotropies in the Circumgalactic Medium of Disk Galaxies: Supermassive Black Hole Activity or Star Formation-driven Outflows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma and X-ray observatories have revealed spectacular structures in the emission of the tenuous hot gas surrounding the Milky Way (MW), known as the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. Galaxy formation simulations suggest that MW-like bubbles could be ubiquitous, but their emission may be too faint to detect with today's instruments in individual external galaxies. In this paper, we present an analysis of stacked Chandra observations of 93 nearby galaxies. We detected soft, diffuse X-rays from the CGM, extending up to 14 kpc, with a luminosity of $(4.2\pm0.7)\times10^{39}$ erg/s in the $0.3-2$ keV band. To probe its spatial distribution, we constructed an azimuthal profile and found a significant enhancement along the galactic minor axis. When dividing our sample by stellar mass, central supermassive black hole mass, and star formation rate, we found that only high star formation rate galaxies exhibit significant anisotropies in the CGM emission. To investigate whether the observed anisotropies could be attributed to MW-like bubbles, we compared our results with TNG50 simulations. In these simulations, X-ray bubbles are strongly correlated with mass of the central supermassive black hole and typically extend to much larger, $\sim50$ kpc, scales. We conclude that the observed anisotropies are either caused by AGN-driven MW-like bubbles confined to smaller, $\sim10$ kpc, scales, or by star formation- or starburst-driven bubbles/outflows.</description>

      <title>Zooming In On The Multi-Phase Structure of Magnetically-Dominated Quasar Disks: Radiation From Torus to ISCO Across Accretion Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent radiation-thermochemical-magnetohydrodynamic simulations resolved formation of quasar accretion disks from cosmological scales down to ~300 gravitational radii $R_{g}$, arguing they were 'hyper-magnetized' (plasma $\beta\ll1$ supported by toroidal magnetic fields) and distinct from traditional $\alpha$-disks. We extend these, refining to $\approx 3\,R_{g}$ around a $10^{7}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ BH with multi-channel radiation and thermochemistry, and exploring a factor of 1000 range of accretion rates ($\dot{m}\sim0.01-20$). At smaller scales, we see the disks maintain steady accretion, thermalize and self-ionize, and radiation pressure grows in importance, but large deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and single-phase equations of state are always present. Trans-Alfvenic and highly-supersonic turbulence persists in all cases, and leads to efficient vertical mixing, so radiation pressure saturates at levels comparable to fluctuating magnetic and turbulent pressures even for $\dot{m}\gg1$. The disks also become radiatively inefficient in the inner regions at high $\dot{m}$. The midplane magnetic field remains primarily toroidal at large radii, but at super-Eddington $\dot{m}$ we see occasional transitions to a poloidal-field dominated state associated with outflows and flares. Large-scale magnetocentrifugal and continuum radiation-pressure-driven outflows are weak at $\dot{m}&lt;1$, but can be strong at $\dot{m}\gtrsim1$. In all cases there is a scattering photosphere above the disk extending to $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{g}$ at large $\dot{m}$, and the disk is thick and flared owing to magnetic support (with $H/R$ nearly independent of $\dot{m}$), so the outer disk is strongly illuminated by the inner disk and most of the inner disk continuum scatters or is reprocessed at larger scales, giving apparent emission region sizes as large as $\gtrsim 10^{16}\,{\rm cm}$.</description>

      <title>Are binary-star populations regionally different? --in memory of Sverre Aarseth--</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For synthesising star clusters and whole galaxies, stellar populations need to be modelled by a set of four functions that define their initial distribution of stellar masses and of the orbital properties of their binary-star populations. The initial binaries are dynamically processed in different embedded clusters explaining differences in the observed populations. The approach summarised here, for which the Aarseth Nbody codes have been instrumental, allows inference of the initial conditions of the globular cluster omega Cen and the quantification of the stellar merger rate as a function of stellar spectral type, of the role of multiples and mergers for the Cepheid population, and predictions of extragalactic observables. The observability of the four initial distribution functions and their physical and philosophical meaning are also briefly raised. Evidence for the variation of these functions on the physical conditions of star formation and future steps towards extensions to include higher-order multiple systems are touched upon.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. I. Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>CANUCS/Technicolor: JWST Medium Band Photometry Finds Half of the Star Formation at $z&gt;7.5$ is Obscured</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of 146 high-redshift ($z&gt;7.5$) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling $0.4-5 \mu m$ (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 ($33\%$) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 ($10\%$) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at $z &gt; 7.5$, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at $z&gt;7.5$ have $\sim 25 \%$ of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, $\sim 50 \%$ of the total star formation rate density at $7.5&lt;z&lt;9$ is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to $\sim 35 \%$ in our $9&lt;z&lt;12$ bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at $z &gt; 15$, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Massive Black Hole Mergers in ASTRID: Predictions for LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the ASTRID cosmological simulation to forecast massive black hole (MBH) mergers detectable by LISA down to $z=0$. ASTRID directly models MBH dynamical friction, allowing a realistic tracking of their trajectory. It also incorporates relatively low-mass MBH seeds down to $5\times 10^{4}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, providing a more complete picture of LISA MBH mergers. We find that LISA MBH mergers initially have high eccentricities, peaking around $e_0 = 0.8$ across all redshifts. Accounting for this boosts the event rate from 5.6/yr (if circular orbits are assumed) to 10.5/yr. This enhancement is largely due to additional inspiral sources that will coalesce after LISA's observation, which constitute 46% of detected events. This underscores the importance of LISA's sensitivity to the early inspiral phase, especially for eccentric binaries that emit gravitational waves across a wider frequency band. Most LISA events in ASTRID arise from $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{5-6}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, low-redshift ($z&lt;2$) and low mass-ratio ($q\sim 0.01-0.1)$ mergers. Accounting for eccentricity broadens the detectable MBH mass range up to $10^9~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and shifts the peak of detectable mergers to a lower redshift $z_{\rm peak} = 0.8$. This implies that the most massive LISA events may also be PTA sources. We predict LISA events to be in various galaxy environments, including many low-mass satellite galaxies. The EM counterparts of most LISA sources have AGN luminosities $L_{\rm bol}&gt; 10^{42}$erg/s, albeit only $1\%$ with $ &gt; 10^{44}$erg/s. The brightest AGN are those associated with the rare LISA/PTA events with $M_{\rm BH} &gt; 10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C II] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C II] shells in Galactic H II regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H II regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C II] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and find a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C II]-deficit found in Galactic H II bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <title>Galactic warps: from cosmic noon to the current epoch</title>

Abstract: Approximately half of all disc galaxies exhibit appreciable warps in both their stellar and HI discs. The typical warp amplitude is small (a few degrees), and only becomes noticeable at the periphery of the galaxy disc. As a result, warps remain a relatively poorly studied phenomenon. In this study, we investigate a large sample of distant edge-on galaxies (approximately 1,000 objects) in order to examine the frequency and characteristics of stellar disc warps up to a redshift of $z \sim 2$. For the selected galaxies, we utilize HST data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey field and JWST observations from the Cosmic Dawn Center Archive. We measured the properties of disc warps and investigate their evolution as a function of redshift. Our results indicate a potential evolution in the observed frequency of strong S-shaped warps (with an amplitude greater than 4$^\circ$) in stellar discs as a function of redshift. At $z \approx 2$, the frequency of strong warps reaches approximately 50%, while at $z \approx 0$, this fraction decreases to around 10-15%. We attribute the observed evolution in the occurrence of strong warps to the changing frequency of galaxy interactions and mergers. If galaxy interactions represent one of the primary mechanisms responsible for the formation of warps, then the prevalence of vertical disc deformations should increase in tandem with the rising interaction and merger rate.</description>

      <title>Searching for Compact Obscured Nuclei in Compton Thick AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are heavily obscured infrared cores that have been found in local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). They show bright emission from vibrationally excited rotational transitions of HCN, known as HCN-vib, and are thought to harbor Compton Thick (CT, $N_{\text{H}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) or extreme compact starbursts. We explore the potential evolutionary link between CONs and CT AGN by searching for CONs in hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations that targeted HCN-vib emission in four hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN. We analyze these objects together with literature HCN-vib measurements of five additional hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the GOALS sample. We do not detect any CONs in this combined sample of nine CT AGN. We then explore a proposed evolutionary sequence in which CONs evolve into X-ray-detectable CT AGN once outflows and feedback reduce the column densities of the enshrouding gas. We find, however, no evidence of well-developed dense molecular outflows in the observed CT AGN. While this could suggest that CT AGN are not universally linked to CONs, it could also be explained by a short duty cycle for molecular outflows.</description>

      <title>A positive correlation between broad HI Ly$\alpha$ absorptions and local overdensities of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large fraction of the baryon budget at $z&lt;1$ resides in large-scale filaments in the form of diffuse intergalactic gas, and numerous studies have reported a significant correlation between the strength of the absorptions produced by this gas in the spectra of bright background sources, and impact parameter to cosmic filaments intersected by these sightlines. However, a similar relation is harder to determine for the warm-hot phase of the intergalactic gas, since its higher Doppler parameter and significantly lower neutral gas fraction makes this gas difficult to detect in absorption. We use a sample of 13 broad Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (BLAs) detected in the HST/COS spectrum of a single QSO ($z\sim0.27$), whose sightline intersects several inter-cluster axes, to study the relation between BLAs and the large-scale structure of the Universe. Given their Doppler parameters of $b&gt;40$ km s$^{-1}$, BLAs are good tracers of warm-hot intergalactic gas. We use VLT/MUSE and VLT/VIMOS data to infer local overdensities of galaxies at the redshifts of the BLAs, and to assess the potential association of the BLAs with nearby galaxies. We find that out of the 13 BLAs in our sample, four are associated with a strong overdensity of galaxies, and four with tentative overdensities. The remaining five are located at redshifts where we do not identify any excess of galaxies. We find that these overdensities of galaxies at the redshift of BLAs are local, and they vanish when larger cosmic volumes are considered, in terms of a larger velocity offset to the BLA or larger impact parameter to the QSO sightline. Finally, we find a positive correlation between the total hydrogen column densities inferred from the BLAs, and the relative excess of galaxies at the same redshifts, consistent with the picture where warm-hot gas resides deep within the gravitational potential well of cosmic filaments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in the Eos Cloud: dynamically important fields in the interface between atomic and molecular gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently-discovered Eos molecular cloud, is a CO-dark, low-density cloud located at a distance of approximately 94 pc from the Sun which does not appear to have formed stars at any point in its history. In this paper we investigate the magnetic fields in the Eos cloud, near the interface between the atomic Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and molecular gas, using dust emission and extinction polarimetry. A Histogram of Relative Orientation analysis shows that the magnetic field is preferentially parallel to the density structure of the cloud, while a Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi analysis finds magnetic field strengths of 8$\pm$4 $\mu$G across the Eos cloud and 12$\pm$4 $\mu$G in the somewhat denser MBM 40 sub-region. These results are consistent with a previous estimate of magnetic field strength in the Local Bubble and suggest that the fields in the Eos cloud are dynamically important compared to both gravity and turbulence. Our findings are fully consistent with the expected behavior of magnetized, non-self-gravitating gas near the CNM/molecular cloud boundary.</description>

      <title>Accessing a New Population of Supermassive Black Holes with Extensions to the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope has produced resolved images of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87*, which present the largest shadows on the sky. In the next decade, technological improvements and extensions to the array will enable access to a greater number of sources, unlocking studies of a larger population of supermassive black holes through direct imaging. In this paper, we identify 12 of the most promising sources beyond Sgr A* and M87* based on their angular size and millimeter flux density. For each of these sources, we make theoretical predictions for their observable properties by ray tracing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic models appropriately scaled to each target's mass, distance, and flux density. We predict that these sources would have somewhat higher Eddington ratios than M87*, which may result in larger optical and Faraday depths than previous EHT targets. Despite this, we find that visibility amplitude size constraints can plausibly recover masses within a factor of 2, although the unknown jet contribution remains a significant uncertainty. We find that the linearly polarized structure evolves substantially with Eddington ratio, with greater evolution at larger inclinations, complicating potential spin inferences for inclined sources. We discuss the importance of 345 GHz observations, milli-Jansky baseline sensitivity, and independent inclination constraints for future observations with upgrades to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) through ground updates with the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) program and extensions to space through the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Continuum Time Delay Variation Phenomenon in an Active Supermassive Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolving the accretion disks and broad line regions (BLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can probe the physics behind supermassive black holes (SMBHs) fueling and weigh SMBHs. With time-domain observations, the reverberation mapping (RM) technique measures time delays between different light curves, probing the AGN inner structures that are otherwise often too compact to resolve spatially with current facilities. Theoretically, the SMBH accretion disk structure does not evolve over decades. Here we report the significant variations in the continuum time delays of NGC 4151. In the high-flux state, our high-cadence ($\sim 2$ days) spectroscopy reveals that continuum time delays are $3.8^{+1.8}_{-1.0}$ times larger than those in the low-flux state and $14.9\pm 2.0$ times longer than the classical standard thin disk prediction. Notably, the continuum time delays can be comparable with the time delay between H$\beta$ and the $5100\ \mathrm{\AA}$ continuum, and the latter is commonly used to calculate the BLR sizes. Hence, the BLR sizes are underestimated if the continuum time delays are not considered, which introduces $\sim 0.3$ dex systematic uncertainties on RM SMBH masses. Our findings underscore that simultaneous continuum and BLR RMs are vital for better deciphering the SMBH accretion and mass function.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for flux scale errors in Galactic synchrotron maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 408 MHz Haslam map is widely used as a low-frequency anchor for the intensity and morphology of Galactic synchrotron emission. Multi-frequency, multi-experiment fits show evidence of spatial variation and curvature in the synchrotron frequency spectrum, but there are also poorly-understood multiplicative flux scale disagreements between experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison across a range of scenarios, using fits that include recent spectroscopic observations at $\sim 1$ GHz by MeerKAT as well as a reference map from the OVRO-LWA at 73 MHz. In the few square degrees that we analyzed, a large uncorrected flux scale factor potentially as large as 1.6 in the Haslam data is preferred, indicating a 60\% overestimation of the brightness. This partly undermines its use as a reference map. We also find that models with nonzero spectral curvature are statistically disfavored. Given the limited sky coverage here, we suggest a similar analysis across many more regions of the sky to determine the extent and variation of flux scale errors, and whether they should be treated as random or systematic errors in analyses that use the Haslam map as a template.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We investigate the significance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. Specifically, we develop relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms including two different environmental effects in the EMRI waveforms: power-law migration torques, and superradiance scalar clouds. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms incorrectly estimate the predicted source's horizon redshift by approximately $35\%$ error. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameter estimates (error $\simeq 8\%$), representing a significant improvement over previous estimates. Additionally, we assess the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk biases the parameter estimation (PE), reporting a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. In a fully relativistic setup, we also estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with relative errors $\simeq 0.3\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects is essential for LISA science objectives with EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Minute time scale variability in $\gamma$-ray flare of BL Lacertae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In October 2024, The object BL Lac experienced a brightest flaring event in gamma-ray ($&gt;$100 MeV) with a historical $\gamma$-ray flux of $\sim$10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Soon after the event was followed across the waveband and in X-ray (0.3-10 keV) it was also found to be flaring with the maximum flux achieved during this event as 8.30$\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The high gamma-ray significance enables us to probe the shortest time scale variability possible and for that, we produced the orbital binned light curve, 5 minutes binned light curve, and the 2 minutes binned light curve. A clear variation is seen in the 5-minute light curve and is fitted with the sum of exponentials to derive the rise and decay time scale which ranges between 3 to 12 minutes. The fastest variability time is also estimated to be an order of 1 minute from 2 minute. The estimated size of the emission region is very small (10$^{13}$ cm) compared to the size of the black hole event horizon. The location of the emission region is estimated to be very close to the supermassive black hole (10$^{14}$ cm) and much inside the BLR (0.1 pc). We discussed the possible way to explain this fast-flux variability in BL Lac.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Tomographic halo model of the unWISE-Blue galaxies using cross-correlations with BOSS CMASS galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The halo model offers a framework for investigating galaxy clustering, and for understanding the growth of galaxies and the distribution of galaxies of different types. Here, we use the halo model to study the small-scale clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of the unWISE-Blue galaxy sample, an infrared-selected sample of $\sim$100 million galaxies across the entire extragalactic sky at $z\sim 0.5$ $-$ similar redshifts to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS sample. Although the photometric unWISE galaxies cannot be easily split in redshift, we use their cross-correlation with the BOSS CMASS sample to tomographically probe the HOD of the unWISE galaxies at $0.45 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$. To do so, we develop a new method for applying the halo model to cross-correlations between a photometric sample and a spectroscopic sample in narrow redshift bins, incorporating halo exclusion, post-Limber corrections, and redshift-space distortions. We reveal strong evolution in the CMASS HOD, and modest evolution in the unWISE-Blue HOD. For unWISE-Blue, we find that the average bias and mean halo mass drop from $b = 1.6$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.4$ at $z \sim 0.5$ to $b = 1.4$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.1$ at $z \sim 0.7$, and that the satellite fraction drops modestly from $\sim$20% to $\sim$10% in the same range. These results are useful for creating mock samples of the unWISE-Blue galaxies. Furthermore, the techniques developed to obtain these results are applicable to other tomographic cross-correlations between photometric samples and narrowly-binned spectroscopic samples, such as clustering redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The blue supergiant (BSG) domain contains a large variety of stars whose past and future evolutionary paths are still highly uncertain. Since binary interaction plays a crucial role in the fate of massive stars, investigating the multiplicity among BSGs helps shed light on the fate of such objects. We aim to estimate the binary fraction of a large sample of BSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud within the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey. In total, we selected 262 targets with spectral types B0-B3 and luminosity classes I-II. This work is based on spectroscopic data collected by the GIRAFFE instrument, mounted on the Very Large Telescope, which gathered nine epochs over three months. Our spectroscopic analysis for each target includes the individual and peak-to-peak radial velocity measurements, an investigation of the line profile variability, and a periodogram analysis to search for possible short- and long-period binaries. By applying a 20 km s$^{-1}$ threshold on the peak-to-peak radial velocities above which we would consider the star to be binary, the resulting observed spectroscopic binary fraction for our BSG sample is 23 $\pm$ 3$\%$. In addition, we derived reliable orbital periods for 41 spectroscopic binaries and potential binary candidates, among which there are 17 eclipsing binaries, including 20 SB1 and SB2 systems with periods of less than 10 days. We reported a significant drop in the binary fraction of BSGs with spectral types later than B2 and effective temperatures less than 18 kK, which could indicate the end of the main sequence phase in this temperature regime. We found no metallicity dependence in the binary fraction of BSGs, compared to existing spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reanalysis of KMTNet Microlensing Events, Paper II: Two New Planets in Giant-Source Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to apply the updated KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometric pipeline to historical microlensing events. We apply the pipeline to a subsample of events from the KMTNet database, which we refer to as the giant source sample. Leveraging the improved photometric data, we conduct a systematic search for anomalies within this sample. The search successfully uncovers four new planet-like anomalies and recovers two previously known planetary signals. After detailed analysis, two of the newly discovered anomalies are confirmed as clear planets: KMT-2019-BLG-0578 and KMT-2021-BLG-0736. Their planet-to-host mass ratios are $q\sim4\times10^{-3}$ and $q\sim1\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Another event, OGLE-2018-BLG-0421 (KMT-2018-BLG-0831), remains ambiguous. Both a stellar companion and a giant planet in the lens system could potentially explain the observed anomaly. The anomaly signal of the last event, MOA-2022-BLG-038 (KMT-2022-BLG-2342), is attributed to an extra source star. Within this sample, our procedure doubles the number of confirmed planets, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the survey sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Microlensing at Cosmological Distances: Event Rate Predictions in the Warhol Arc of MACS 0416</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly magnified stars ($\mu$ $&gt;$ 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT discovers a jet-driven bow shock near GRS 1915+105. How an invisible large-scale jet sculpts a microquasar's environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17425</link>

Abstract: Black holes, both supermassive and stellar-mass, impact the evolution of their surroundings on a large range of scales. While the role of supermassive black holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their surroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), remain under explored.
  This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for its active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact of GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM interaction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total exposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to date. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we inferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into the jet-ISM interaction site.
  Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely induced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity in the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\,cm$^{-3}$ while assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\,K, which implies a bow shock expansion velocity of $20\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}&lt;\dot{L} &lt;\,360\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow shock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate Conclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy dissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through the interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the environment.
  This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black holes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's activity has in shaping its surroundings.</description>
