      <title>Asymmetry and Dynamical Constraints in 2-Limbs Retrieval of WASP-39 b Inferring from JWST Data</title>

Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insight into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum contains contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, which can differ in temperature, composition and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. While high-resolution ground-based observations have identified limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot/hot exoplanets, space-based studies of limb asymmetry are still in their early stages. The prevalence of limb asymmetry across a broad range of exoplanets remains largely unexplored. We conduct a comparative analysis of retrievals on transmission spectra, including traditional 1D approaches and four 2D models that account for limb asymmetry. Two of these 2D models include our newly proposed dynamical constraints derived from shallow-water simulations to provide physically-motivated temperature differences between limbs. Our analysis of WASP-39 b using JWST observations and previous combined datasets (HST, VLT, and Spitzer) strongly favors 2D retrievals over traditional 1D approaches, confirming significant limb asymmetry in this hot Jupiter. Within our 2D framework, unconstrained models recover larger temperature contrasts than dynamically-constrained models, with improved fits to specific spectral features, although Bayesian evidence cannot definitively distinguish between these 2D approaches. Our results support the presence of homogeneous C/O in both the morning and evening atmospheres, but with temperature differences leading to variations in clouds and hazes. Using this treatment, we can study a larger sample of hot Jupiters to gain insights into atmospheric limb asymmetries on these planets.</description>

      <title>Modeling hot, anisotropic ion beams in the solar wind motivated by the Parker Solar Probe observations near perihelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00659</link>

Abstract: Recent observations of the solar wind ions by the SPAN-I instruments on board the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft at solar perihelia (Encounters) 4 and closer find ample evidence of complex anisotropic non-Maxwellian velocity distributions that consist of core, beam, and `hammerhead' (i.e., anisotropic beam) populations. The proton core populations are anisotropic, with T_perp/T||&gt;1, and the beams have super-Alfvenic speed relative to the core (we provide an example from Encounter 17). The alpha-particle population show similar features as the protons. These unstable VDFs are associated with enhanced, right-hand (RH) and left-hand (LH) polarized ion-scale kinetic wave activity, detected by the FIELDS instrument. Motivated by PSP observations, we employ nonlinear hybrid models to investigate the evolution of the anisotropic hot-beam VDFs and model the growth and the nonlinear stage of ion kinetic instabilities in several linearly unstable cases. The models are initialized with ion VDFs motivated by the observational parameters. We find rapidly growing (in terms of proton gyroperiods) combined ion-cyclotron (IC) and magnetosonic (MS) instabilities, which produce LH and RH ion-scale wave spectra, respectively. The modeled ion VDFs in the nonlinear stage of the evolution are qualitatively in agreement with PSP observations of the anisotropic core and `hammerhead' velocity distributions, quantifying the effect of the ion kinetic instabilities on wind plasma heating close to the Sun. We conclude that the wave-particle interactions play an important role in the energy transfer between the magnetic energy (waves) and random particle motion leading to anisotropic solar wind plasma heating.</description>

      <title>Determining the 3D Dynamics of Solar Flare Magnetic Reconnection</title>

Abstract: Solar flares are major space weather events that result from the explosive conversion of stored magnetic energy into bulk motion, plasma heating, and particle acceleration. While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure. We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting SolO, IRIS, and DKIST observations of explosive flare energy release.</description>

      <title>Observation of Alfven solitons in the solar corona using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.</description>
