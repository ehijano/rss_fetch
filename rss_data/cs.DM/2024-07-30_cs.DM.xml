      <title>Models of random spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are numerous randomized algorithms to generate spanning trees in a given ambient graph; several target the uniform distribution on trees (UST), while in practice the fastest and most frequently used draw random weights on the edges and then employ a greedy algorithm to choose the minimum-weight spanning tree (MST). Though MST is a workhorse in applications, the mathematical properties of random MST are far less explored than those of UST. In this paper we develop tools for the quantitative study of random MST. We consider the standard case that the weights are drawn i.i.d. from a single distribution on the real numbers, as well as successive generalizations that lead to \emph{product measures}, where the weights are independently drawn from arbitrary distributions.</description>

      <title>Equality cases of the Stanley--Yan log-concave matroid inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Stanley--Yan} (SY) \emph{inequality} gives the ultra-log-concavity for the numbers of bases of a matroid which have given sizes of intersections with $k$ fixed disjoint sets. The inequality was proved by Stanley (1981) for regular matroids, and by Yan (2023) in full generality. In the original paper, Stanley asked for equality conditions of the SY~inequality, and proved total equality conditions for regular matroids in the case $k=0$. In this paper, we completely resolve Stanley's problem. First, we obtain an explicit description of the equality cases of the SY inequality for $k=0$, extending Stanley's results to general matroids and removing the ``total equality'' assumption. Second, for $k\ge 1$, we prove that the equality cases of the SY inequality cannot be described in a sense that they are not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level.</description>

      <title>The Bidirected Cut Relaxation for Steiner Tree has Integrality Gap Smaller than 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Steiner tree problem is one of the most prominent problems in network design. Given an edge-weighted undirected graph and a subset of the vertices, called terminals, the task is to compute a minimum-weight tree containing all terminals (and possibly further vertices). The best-known approximation algorithms for Steiner tree involve enumeration of a (polynomial but) very large number of candidate components and are therefore slow in practice.
  A promising ingredient for the design of fast and accurate approximation algorithms for Steiner tree is the bidirected cut relaxation (BCR): bidirect all edges, choose an arbitrary terminal as a root, and enforce that each cut containing some terminal but not the root has one unit of fractional edges leaving it. BCR is known to be integral in the spanning tree case [Edmonds'67], i.e., when all the vertices are terminals. For general instances, however, it was not even known whether the integrality gap of BCR is better than the integrality gap of the natural undirected relaxation, which is exactly 2. We resolve this question by proving an upper bound of 1.9988 on the integrality gap of BCR.</description>

      <title>Topological Drawings meet Classical Theorems from Convex Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.12568v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss classical theorems from Convex Geometry in the context of topological drawings and beyond. In a simple topological drawing of the complete graph $K_n$, any two edges share at most one point: either a common vertex or a point where they cross. Triangles of simple topological drawings can be viewed as convex sets. This gives a link to convex geometry.
  As our main result, we present a generalization of Kirchberger's Theorem that is of purely combinatorial nature. It turned out that this classical theorem also applies to "generalized signotopes" - a combinatorial generalization of simple topological drawings, which we introduce and investigate in the course of this article. As indicated by the name they are a generalization of signotopes, a structure studied in the context of encodings for arrangements of pseudolines.
  We also present a family of simple topological drawings with arbitrarily large Helly number, and a new proof of a topological generalization of Carath\'{e}odory's Theorem in the plane and discuss further classical theorems from Convex Geometry in the context of simple topological drawings.</description>

      <title>Non-Clashing Teaching Maps for Balls in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and showed it is the most efficient machine teaching model satisfying the Goldman-Mathias collusion-avoidance criterion. A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \in \mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the maximum size of a teaching set $T(C)$, $C \in \mathcal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension NCTD$(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\mathcal{C}$. NCTM$^+$ and NCTD$^+(\mathcal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may only use positive examples.
  We study NCTMs and NCTM$^+$s for the concept class $\mathcal{B}(G)$ consisting of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision problem B-NCTD$^+$ for NCTD$^+$ is NP-complete in split, co-bipartite, and bipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails, B-NCTD$^+$ does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(\text{vc})}}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a kernel with $2^{o(\text{vc})}$ vertices, where vc is the vertex cover number of $G$. We complement these lower bounds with matching upper bounds. These are extremely rare results: it is only the second problem in NP to admit such a tight double-exponential lower bound parameterized by vc, and only one of very few problems to admit such an ETH-based conditional lower bound on the number of vertices in a kernel. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and trees of cycles, we derive NCTM$^+$s or NCTMs for $\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size proportional to its VC-dimension, and for Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an approximate NCTM$^+$ of size 2.</description>

      <title>Finding Increasingly Large Extremal Graphs with AlphaZero and Tabu Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies a central extremal graph theory problem inspired by a 1975 conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, which aims to find graphs with a given size (number of nodes) that maximize the number of edges without having 3- or 4-cycles. We formulate this problem as a sequential decision-making problem and compare AlphaZero, a neural network-guided tree search, with tabu search, a heuristic local search method. Using either method, by introducing a curriculum -- jump-starting the search for larger graphs using good graphs found at smaller sizes -- we improve the state-of-the-art lower bounds for several sizes. We also propose a flexible graph-generation environment and a permutation-invariant network architecture for learning to search in the space of graphs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the space of graphs with fixed discrete curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete curvatures are quantities associated to the nodes and edges of a graph that reflect the local geometry around them. These curvatures have a rich mathematical theory and they have recently found success as a tool to analyze networks across a wide range of domains. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Submodular Minimization under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the computational complexity of a robust variant of a two-stage submodular minimization problem that we call Robust Submodular Minimizer. In this problem, we are given $k$ submodular functions~$f_1,\dots,f_k$ over a set family~$2^V$, which represent $k$ possible scenarios in the future when we will need to find an optimal solution for one of these scenarios, i.e., a minimizer for one of the functions. The present task is to find a set $X \subseteq V$ that is close to \emph{some} optimal solution for each $f_i$ in the sense that some minimizer of~$f_i$ can be obtained from $X$ by adding/removing at most $d$ elements for a given integer $d \in \mathbb{N}$. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a complete computational map of this problem with respect to parameters~$k$ and~$d$, which reveals a tight complexity threshold for both parameters: (1) Robust Submodular Minimizer can be solved in polynomial time when $k \leq 2$, but is NP-hard if $k$ is a constant with $k \geq 3$.(2)Robust Submodular Minimizer can be solved in polynomial time when $d=0$, but is NP-hard if $d$ is a constant with $d \geq 1$. (3) Robust Submodular Minimizer is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by~$(k,d)$. We also show that if some submodular function $f_i$ has a polynomial number of minimizers, then the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by $d$. On the other hand, the problem remains $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard parameterized by $k$ even if each function $f_i$ has at most~$|V|$ minimizers. We remark that all our hardness results hold even if each submodular function is given by a cut function of a directed graph.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Reed's conjecture for digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reed in 1998 conjectured that every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil \frac{\Delta(G)+1+\omega(G)}{2} \rceil$. As a partial result, he proved the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for which every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\Delta(G)+1)+\varepsilon\omega(G) \rceil$. We propose an analogue conjecture for digraphs. Given a digraph $D$, we denote by $\vec{\chi}(D)$ the dichromatic number of $D$, which is the minimum number of colours needed to partition $D$ into acyclic induced subdigraphs. We let $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)$ denote the size of the largest biclique (a set of vertices inducing a complete digraph) of $D$ and $\tilde{\Delta}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \sqrt{d^+(v) \cdot d^-(v)}$. We conjecture that every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil \frac{\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1+\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)}{2} \rceil$, which if true implies Reed's conjecture. As a partial result, we prove the existence of $\varepsilon &gt;0$ for which every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1)+\varepsilon\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) \rceil$. This implies both Reed's result and an independent result of Harutyunyan and Mohar for oriented graphs.
  To obtain this upper bound on $\vec{\chi}$, we prove that every digraph $D$ with $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) &gt; \frac{2}{3}(\Delta_{\max}(D)+1)$, where $\Delta_{\max}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \max(d^+(v),d^-(v))$, admits an acyclic set of vertices intersecting each biclique of $D$, which generalises a result of King.</description>
