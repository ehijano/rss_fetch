      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space over the plane with the maximum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $p$-Wasserstein spaces over the branching spaces $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $[0,1]^2$ equipped with the maximum norm metric. We show that these spaces are isometrically rigid for all $p\geq1,$ meaning that all isometries of these spaces are induced by isometries of the underlying space via the push-forward operation. This is in contrast to the case of the Euclidean metric since with that distance the $2$-Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not rigid. Also, we highlight that $1$-Wasserstein space is not rigid over the interval $[0,1]$, while according to our result, its two-dimensional analog with the more complicated geodesic structure is rigid. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first ones concerning the structure of isometries of Wasserstein spaces over branching spaces. Accordingly, our proof techniques substantially deviate from those used for non-branching underlying spaces.</description>

      <title>Bounds on hyperbolic sphere packings: On a conjecture by Cohn and Zhao</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sphere packing density bounds in hyperbolic space (and more generally irreducible symmetric spaces of noncompact type), which were conjectured by Cohn and Zhao and generalize Euclidean bounds by Cohn and Elkies. We work within the Bowen-Radin framework of packing density and replace the use of the Poisson summation formula in the proof of the Euclidean bound by Cohn and Elkies with an analogous formula arising from methods used in the theory of mathematical quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Linear Spherical Sliced Optimal Transport: A Fast Metric for Comparing Spherical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient comparison of spherical probability distributions becomes important in fields such as computer vision, geosciences, and medicine. Sliced optimal transport distances, such as spherical and stereographic spherical sliced Wasserstein distances, have recently been developed to address this need. These methods reduce the computational burden of optimal transport by slicing hyperspheres into one-dimensional projections, i.e., lines or circles. Concurrently, linear optimal transport has been proposed to embed distributions into \( L^2 \) spaces, where the \( L^2 \) distance approximates the optimal transport distance, thereby simplifying comparisons across multiple distributions. In this work, we introduce the Linear Spherical Sliced Optimal Transport (LSSOT) framework, which utilizes slicing to embed spherical distributions into \( L^2 \) spaces while preserving their intrinsic geometry, offering a computationally efficient metric for spherical probability measures. We establish the metricity of LSSOT and demonstrate its superior computational efficiency in applications such as cortical surface registration, 3D point cloud interpolation via gradient flow, and shape embedding. Our results demonstrate the significant computational benefits and high accuracy of LSSOT in these applications.</description>

      <title>Gromov hyperbolicity of intrinsic metrics from isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Gromov hyperbolicity of the classical Kobayashi and Hilbert metrics, and the recently introduced minimal metric. Using the linear isoperimetric inequality characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity, we show if these metrics have an "expanding property" near the boundary, then they are Gromov hyperbolic. This provides a new characterization of the convex domains whose Hilbert metric is Gromov hyperbolic, a new proof of Balogh-Bonk's result that the Kobayashi metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a strongly pseudoconvex domain, a new proof of the second author's result that the Kobayashi metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a convex domain with finite type, and a new proof of Fiacchi's result that the minimal metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a strongly minimally convex domain. We also characterize the smoothly bounded convex domains where the minimal metric is Gromov hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>A necessary and sufficient condition for $k$-transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to admit a $k$-transversal, for any $0 \le k \le d-1$. This result is a common generalization of Helly's theorem ($k=0$) and the Goodman-Pollack-Wenger theorem ($k=d-1$). Additionally, we obtain an analogue in the complex setting by characterizing the existence of a complex $k$-transversal to a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{C}^d$, extending the work of McGinnis ($k=d-1$). Our approach employs a Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem on Stiefel manifolds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic theory of $C$-pseudo-cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the non-degenerated $C$-pseudo-cones which can be uniquely decomposed into the sum of a $C$-asymptotic set and a $C$-starting point. Combining this with the novel work in \cite{Schneider-A_weighted_Minkowski_theorem}, we introduce the asymptotic weighted co-volume functional $T_\Theta(E)$ of the non-degenerated $C$-pseudo-cone $E$, which is also a generalized function with the singular point $o$ (the origin). Using our convolution formula for $T_\Theta(E)$, we establish a decay estimate for $T_\Theta(E)$ at infinity and present some interesting results. As applications of this asymptotic theory, we prove a weighted Brunn-Minkowski type inequality and study the solutions to the weighted Minkowski problem for pseudo-cones. Moreover, we pose an open problem regarding $T_\Theta(E)$, which we call the asymptotic Brunn-Minkowski inequality for $C$-pseudo-cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generate anti-self-polar polytopes via a numerical implementation of the gradient flow induced by the diameter functional on the space of all finite subsets of the sphere, and prove related results on the critical points of the diameter functional as well as results about the combinatorics of such polytopes. We also discuss potential connections to Borsuk's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Two-dimension vanishing, splitting and positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several analogs of Gromov's macroscopic dimension conjecture with extra curvature assumptions. More explicitly, we show that for an open Riemannian $n$-manifold $(M,g)$ of nonnegative Ricci (resp. sectional) curvature, if it has uniformly positive scalar curvature and it is uniformly volume noncollapsed, then the essential (resp. Hausdorff) dimension of an asymptotic cone, as a notion of largeness, has a sharp upper bound $n-2$, which is $2$ less than the upper bound for an open Riemannian manifold with only nonnegative Ricci curvature. As a consequence, the dimension of space of linear growth harmonic functions of $M$ has upper bound $n-1$ which is also $2$ less than the sharp bound $n+1$ when $M$ only has nonnegative Ricci curvature. We also prove the first Betti number upper bound is $n-2$ if $M$ is compact, and $n-3$ if $M$ is non-compact. When $M$ is compact we show a fibration theorem over torus, and a rigidity theorem for the fiber when the first Betti number upper bound is achieved.</description>
