      <title>FedMADE: Robust Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection in IoT Networks Using a Dynamic Aggregation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across multiple sectors has escalated serious network security concerns. This has prompted ongoing research in Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for cyber-attack classification. Traditional ML models require data transmission from IoT devices to a centralized server for traffic analysis, raising severe privacy concerns. To address this issue, researchers have studied Federated Learning (FL)-based IDSs that train models across IoT devices while keeping their data localized. However, the heterogeneity of data, stemming from distinct vulnerabilities of devices and complexity of attack vectors, poses a significant challenge to the effectiveness of FL models. While current research focuses on adapting various ML models within the FL framework, they fail to effectively address the issue of attack class imbalance among devices, which significantly degrades the classification accuracy of minority attacks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce FedMADE, a novel dynamic aggregation method, which clusters devices by their traffic patterns and aggregates local models based on their contributions towards overall performance. We evaluate FedMADE against other FL algorithms designed for non-IID data and observe up to 71.07% improvement in minority attack classification accuracy. We further show that FedMADE is robust to poisoning attacks and incurs only a 4.7% (5.03 seconds) latency overhead in each communication round compared to FedAvg, without increasing the computational load of IoT devices.</description>

      <title>VulCatch: Enhancing Binary Vulnerability Detection through CodeT5 Decompilation and KAN Advanced Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary program vulnerability detection is critical for software security, yet existing deep learning approaches often rely on source code analysis, limiting their ability to detect unknown vulnerabilities. To address this, we propose VulCatch, a binary-level vulnerability detection framework. VulCatch introduces a Synergy Decompilation Module (SDM) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to transform raw binary code into pseudocode using CodeT5, preserving high-level semantics for deep analysis with tools like Ghidra and IDA. KAN further enhances feature transformation, enabling the detection of complex vulnerabilities. VulCatch employs word2vec, Inception Blocks, BiLSTM Attention, and Residual connections to achieve high detection accuracy (98.88%) and precision (97.92%), while minimizing false positives (1.56%) and false negatives (2.71%) across seven CVE datasets.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping Mobile Apps and Actions through Wireless Traffic in the Open World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While smartphones and WiFi networks are bringing many positive changes to people's lives, they are susceptible to traffic analysis attacks, which infer user's private information from encrypted traffic. Existing traffic analysis attacks mainly target TCP/IP layers or are limited to the closed-world assumption, where all possible apps and actions have been involved in the model training. To overcome these limitations, we propose MACPrint, a novel system that infers mobile apps and in-app actions based on WiFi MAC layer traffic in the open-world setting. MACPrint first extracts rich statistical and contextual features of encrypted wireless traffic. Then, we develop Label Recorder, an automatic traffic labeling app, to improve labeling accuracy in the training phase. Finally, TCN models with OpenMax functions are used to recognize mobile apps and actions in the open world accurately. To evaluate our system, we collect MAC layer traffic data over 125 hours from more than 40 apps. The experimental results show that MAC-Print can achieve an accuracy of over 96% for recognizing apps and actions in the closed-world setting, and obtains an accuracy of over 86% in the open-world setting.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Model based Personal Information Extraction and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically extracting personal information--such as name, phone number, and email address--from publicly available profiles at a large scale is a stepstone to many other security attacks including spear phishing. Traditional methods--such as regular expression, keyword search, and entity detection--achieve limited success at such personal information extraction. In this work, we perform a systematic measurement study to benchmark large language model (LLM) based personal information extraction and countermeasures. Towards this goal, we present a framework for LLM-based extraction attacks; collect three datasets including a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 and two real-world datasets with manually labeled 8 categories of personal information; introduce a novel mitigation strategy based on \emph{prompt injection}; and systematically benchmark LLM-based attacks and countermeasures using 10 LLMs and our 3 datasets. Our key findings include: LLM can be misused by attackers to accurately extract various personal information from personal profiles; LLM outperforms conventional methods at such extraction; and prompt injection can mitigate such risk to a large extent and outperforms conventional countermeasures. Our code and data are available at: \url{https://github.com/liu00222/LLM-Based-Personal-Profile-Extraction}.</description>

      <title>At Least Factor-of-Two Optimization for RWLE-Based Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern applications that deal with sensitive data, such as healthcare and government services, outsource computation to cloud platforms. In such untrusted environments, privacy is of vital importance. One solution to this problem is homomorphic encryption (HE), a family of cryptographic schemes that support certain algebraic operations on encrypted data without the need for decryption. However, despite major advancements, encryption in modern HE schemes still comes with a non-trivial computational overhead that can hamper data-intensive workloads. To resolve this, recent research has shown that leveraging caching techniques, such as Rache, can significantly enhance the performance of HE schemes while maintaining security. Rache unfortunately displays a key limitation in the time complexity of its caching procedure, which scales with the size of the plaintext space. Smuche is another caching scheme that simultaneously improves the scalability of the caching procedure and turns the encryption process into a constant-time operation, utilizing only a single scalar multiplication. Even still, more can be done. In this paper, we present an encryption method we call ``Zinc" which entirely forgoes the multiple caching process, replacing it with a single scalar addition, and then injecting randomness that takes constant time with respect to the plaintext space. This injection of randomness is similar to Smuche, and a great improvement from Rache, allowing Zinc to achieve efficiency without compromising security. We implement the scheme using Microsoft SEAL and compare its performance to vanilla CKKS.</description>

      <title>BadMerging: Backdoor Attacks Against Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks has led to a proliferation of open-sourced task-specific models. Recently, Model Merging (MM) has emerged as an effective approach to facilitate knowledge transfer among these independently fine-tuned models. MM directly combines multiple fine-tuned task-specific models into a merged model without additional training, and the resulting model shows enhanced capabilities in multiple tasks. Although MM provides great utility, it may come with security risks because an adversary can exploit MM to affect multiple downstream tasks. However, the security risks of MM have barely been studied. In this paper, we first find that MM, as a new learning paradigm, introduces unique challenges for existing backdoor attacks due to the merging process. To address these challenges, we introduce BadMerging, the first backdoor attack specifically designed for MM. Notably, BadMerging allows an adversary to compromise the entire merged model by contributing as few as one backdoored task-specific model. BadMerging comprises a two-stage attack mechanism and a novel feature-interpolation-based loss to enhance the robustness of embedded backdoors against the changes of different merging parameters. Considering that a merged model may incorporate tasks from different domains, BadMerging can jointly compromise the tasks provided by the adversary (on-task attack) and other contributors (off-task attack) and solve the corresponding unique challenges with novel attack designs. Extensive experiments show that BadMerging achieves remarkable attacks against various MM algorithms. Our ablation study demonstrates that the proposed attack designs can progressively contribute to the attack performance. Finally, we show that prior defense mechanisms fail to defend against our attacks, highlighting the need for more advanced defense.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Immersive Cyber Situational Awareness Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber situational awareness systems are increasingly used for creating cyber common operating pictures for cybersecurity analysis and education. However, these systems face data occlusion and convolution issues due to the burgeoning complexity, dimensionality, and heterogeneity of cybersecurity data, which damages cyber Situational Awareness (SA) of end-users. Moreover, conventional ways of human-computer interactions, such as mouse and keyboard, increase the mental effort and cognitive load of cybersecurity practitioners, when analyzing cyber situations of large-scale infrastructures. Therefore, immersive technologies, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, are employed in the cybersecurity realm to create intuitive, engaging, and interactive cyber common operating pictures. The Immersive Cyber Situational Awareness (ICSA) systems provide several unique visualization techniques and interaction features for the perception, comprehension, and projection of cyber SA. However, there has been no attempt to comprehensively investigate and classify the existing state of the art in the use of immersive technologies for cyber SA. Therefore, in this paper, we have gathered, analyzed, and synthesized the existing body of knowledge on ICSA systems. In particular, our survey has identified visualization and interaction techniques, evaluation mechanisms, and different levels of cyber SA (i.e., perception, comprehension, and projection) for ICSA systems. Consequently, our survey has enabled us to propose: (i) a reference framework for designing and analyzing ICSA systems by mapping immersive visualization and interaction techniques to the different levels of ICSA; (ii) future research directions for advancing the state-of-the-art on ICSA systems; and (iii) an in-depth analysis of the industrial implications of ICSA systems to enhance cybersecurity operations.</description>

      <title>Sonic: Fast and Transferable Data Poisoning on Clustering Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data poisoning attacks on clustering algorithms have received limited attention, with existing methods struggling to scale efficiently as dataset sizes and feature counts increase. These attacks typically require re-clustering the entire dataset multiple times to generate predictions and assess the attacker's objectives, significantly hindering their scalability. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing Sonic, a novel genetic data poisoning attack that leverages incremental and scalable clustering algorithms, e.g., FISHDBC, as surrogates to accelerate poisoning attacks against graph-based and density-based clustering methods, such as HDBSCAN. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Sonic in poisoning the target clustering algorithms. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting the scalability and transferability of poisoning attacks against clustering algorithms, and we conclude by examining the robustness of hyperparameters in our attack strategy Sonic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With significant advancements in Transformers LLMs, NLP has extended its reach into many research fields due to its enhanced capabilities in text generation and user interaction. One field benefiting greatly from these advancements is cybersecurity. In cybersecurity, many parameters that need to be protected and exchanged between senders and receivers are in the form of text and tabular data, making NLP a valuable tool in enhancing the security measures of communication protocols. This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the utilization of Transformers and LLMs in cyber-threat detection systems. The methodology of paper selection and bibliometric analysis is outlined to establish a rigorous framework for evaluating existing research. The fundamentals of Transformers are discussed, including background information on various cyber-attacks and datasets commonly used in this field. The survey explores the application of Transformers in IDSs, focusing on different architectures such as Attention-based models, LLMs like BERT and GPT, CNN/LSTM-Transformer hybrids, emerging approaches like ViTs, among others. Furthermore, it explores the diverse environments and applications where Transformers and LLMs-based IDS have been implemented, including computer networks, IoT devices, critical infrastructure protection, cloud computing, SDN, as well as in autonomous vehicles. The paper also addresses research challenges and future directions in this area, identifying key issues such as interpretability, scalability, and adaptability to evolving threats, and more. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the findings and highlights the significance of Transformers and LLMs in enhancing cyber-threat detection capabilities, while also outlining potential avenues for further research and development.</description>

      <title>Practical Considerations for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy is the gold standard for statistical data release. Used by governments, companies, and academics, its mathematically rigorous guarantees and worst-case assumptions on the strength and knowledge of attackers make it a robust and compelling framework for reasoning about privacy. However, even with landmark successes, differential privacy has not achieved widespread adoption in everyday data use and data protection. In this work we examine some of the practical obstacles that stand in the way.</description>

      <title>"You still have to study" -- On the Security of LLM generated code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We witness an increasing usage of AI-assistants even for routine (classroom) programming tasks. However, the code generated on basis of a so called "prompt" by the programmer does not always meet accepted security standards. On the one hand, this may be due to lack of best-practice examples in the training data. On the other hand, the actual quality of the programmers prompt appears to influence whether generated code contains weaknesses or not. In this paper we analyse 4 major LLMs with respect to the security of generated code. We do this on basis of a case study for the Python and Javascript language, using the MITRE CWE catalogue as the guiding security definition. Our results show that using different prompting techniques, some LLMs initially generate 65% code which is deemed insecure by a trained security engineer. On the other hand almost all analysed LLMs will eventually generate code being close to 100% secure with increasing manual guidance of a skilled engineer.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Static Analysis for Precise Identification of Vulnerable OSS Versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature. However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities. Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and trace the code involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules. They then use syntactic-level code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions. These methods are hindered by imprecisions due to (1) the inclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of syntactic-level code clone detection. This paper presents Vercation, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++. Vercation combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. It then backtraces historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code. We propose semantic-level code clone detection to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling to identify the vulnerable versions between the patch commit and the vic. We curate a dataset linking 74 OSS vulnerabilities and 1013 versions to evaluate Vercation. On this dataset, our approach achieves the F1 score of 92.4%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, Vercation detected 134 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Models for Vulnerability Detection: An Extensive Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though many deep learning-based models have made great progress in vulnerability detection, we have no good understanding of these models, which limits the further advancement of model capability, understanding of the mechanism of model detection, and efficiency and safety of practical application of models. In this paper, we extensively and comprehensively investigate two types of state-of-the-art learning-based approaches (sequence-based and graph-based) by conducting experiments on a recently built large-scale dataset. We investigate seven research questions from five dimensions, namely model capabilities, model interpretation, model stability, ease of use of model, and model economy. We experimentally demonstrate the priority of sequence-based models and the limited abilities of both LLM (ChatGPT) and graph-based models. We explore the types of vulnerability that learning-based models skilled in and reveal the instability of the models though the input is subtlely semantical-equivalently changed. We empirically explain what the models have learned. We summarize the pre-processing as well as requirements for easily using the models. Finally, we initially induce the vital information for economically and safely practical usage of these models.</description>

      <title>Volley Revolver: A Novel Matrix-Encoding Method for Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks (Inference)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12577v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel matrix-encoding method that is particularly convenient for neural networks to make predictions in a privacy-preserving manner using homomorphic encryption. Based on this encoding method, we implement a convolutional neural network for handwritten image classification over encryption. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform homomorphic multiplication, the main idea behind it, in a simple version, is to encrypt matrix $A$ and the transpose of matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively. With additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication can be calculated over encrypted matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation, we in advance span each convolution kernel to a matrix space of the same size as the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which is later used together with the ciphertext encrypting input images for calculating some of the final convolution results. We accumulate all these intermediate results and thus complete the convolution operation.
  In a public cloud with 40 vCPUs, our convolutional neural network implementation on the MNIST testing dataset takes $\sim$ 287 seconds to compute ten likelihoods of 32 encrypted images of size $28 \times 28$ simultaneously. The data owner only needs to upload one ciphertext ($\sim 19.8$ MB) encrypting these 32 images to the public cloud.</description>

      <title>GTree: GPU-Friendly Privacy-preserving Decision Tree Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision tree (DT) is a widely used machine learning model due to its versatility, speed, and interpretability. However, for privacy-sensitive applications, outsourcing DT training and inference to cloud platforms raise concerns about data privacy. Researchers have developed privacy-preserving approaches for DT training and inference using cryptographic primitives, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). While these approaches have shown progress, they still suffer from heavy computation and communication overheads. Few recent works employ Graphical Processing Units (GPU) to improve the performance of MPC-protected deep learning. This raises a natural question: \textit{can MPC-protected DT training and inference be accelerated by GPU?}
  We present GTree, the first scheme that uses GPU to accelerate MPC-protected secure DT training and inference. GTree is built across 3 parties who securely and jointly perform each step of DT training and inference with GPU. Each MPC protocol in GTree is designed in a GPU-friendly version. The performance evaluation shows that GTree achieves ${\thicksim}11{\times}$ and ${\thicksim}21{\times}$ improvements in training SPECT and Adult datasets, compared to the prior most efficient CPU-based work. For inference, GTree shows its superior efficiency when the DT has less than 10 levels, which is $126\times$ faster than the prior most efficient work when inferring $10^4$ instances with a tree of 7 levels. GTree also achieves a stronger security guarantee than prior solutions, which only leaks the tree depth and size of data samples while prior solutions also leak the tree structure. With \textit{oblivious array access}, the access pattern on GPU is also protected.</description>

      <title>Elephants Do Not Forget: Differential Privacy with State Continuity for Privacy Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current implementations of differentially-private (DP) systems either lack support to track the global privacy budget consumed on a dataset, or fail to faithfully maintain the state continuity of this budget. We show that failure to maintain a privacy budget enables an adversary to mount replay, rollback and fork attacks - obtaining answers to many more queries than what a secure system would allow. As a result the attacker can reconstruct secret data that DP aims to protect - even if DP code runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We propose ElephantDP, a system that aims to provide the same guarantees as a trusted curator in the global DP model would, albeit set in an untrusted environment. Our system relies on a state continuity module to provide protection for the privacy budget and a TEE to faithfully execute DP code and update the budget. To provide security, our protocol makes several design choices including the content of the persistent state and the order between budget updates and query answers. We prove that ElephantDP provides liveness (i.e., the protocol can restart from a correct state and respond to queries as long as the budget is not exceeded) and DP confidentiality (i.e., an attacker learns about a dataset as much as it would from interacting with a trusted curator). Our implementation and evaluation of the protocol use Intel SGX as a TEE to run the DP code and a network of TEEs to maintain state continuity. Compared to an insecure baseline, we observe 1.1-3.2$\times$ overheads and lower relative overheads for complex DP queries.</description>

      <title>BlockFUL: Enabling Unlearning in Blockchained Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper, we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead, thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 models.</description>

Abstract: Model fragile watermarking, inspired by both the field of adversarial attacks on neural networks and traditional multimedia fragile watermarking, has gradually emerged as a potent tool for detecting tampering, and has witnessed rapid development in recent years. Unlike robust watermarks, which are widely used for identifying model copyrights, fragile watermarks for models are designed to identify whether models have been subjected to unexpected alterations such as backdoors, poisoning, compression, among others. These alterations can pose unknown risks to model users, such as misidentifying stop signs as speed limit signs in classic autonomous driving scenarios. This paper provides an overview of the relevant work in the field of model fragile watermarking since its inception, categorizing them and revealing the developmental trajectory of the field, thus offering a comprehensive survey for future endeavors in model fragile watermarking.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Logistic Regression Training on Large Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning is one class of cryptographic methods that aim to analyze private and sensitive data while keeping privacy, such as homomorphic logistic regression training over large encrypted data. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for logistic regression training on large encrypted data using Homomorphic Encryption (HE), which is the mini-batch version of recent methods using a faster gradient variant called $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$. It is claimed that $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$ can integrate curve information (Hessian matrix) into the gradient and therefore can effectively accelerate the first-order gradient (descent) algorithms. We also implement the full-batch version of their method when the encrypted dataset is so large that it has to be encrypted in the mini-batch manner. We compare our mini-batch algorithm with our full-batch implementation method on real financial data consisting of 422,108 samples with 200 freatures. %Our experiments show that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) Given the inefficiency of HEs, our results are inspiring and demonstrate that the logistic regression training on large encrypted dataset is of practical feasibility, marking a significant milestone in our understanding.</description>

      <title>ConfusedPilot: Confused Deputy Risks in RAG-based LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.
  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control-flow attestation unifies the worlds of control-flow integrity and platform attestation by measuring and reporting a target's run-time behaviour to a verifier. Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether its execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been explored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things devices, cloud platforms, and many others. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years, the area remains fragmented, addressing different adversarial behaviours, verification paradigms, and deployment challenges. In this paper, we present the first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and solutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers published between 2016-2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and pose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) is an important branch of quantum cryptography, which enables the secure transmission of messages without prior key encryption. However, traditional quantum communication protocols rely on the security and trustworthiness of the devices employed to implement the protocols, which can be susceptible to attacks. Device-independent (DI) quantum protocols, on the other hand, aim to secure quantum communication independent of the devices used by leveraging fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. In this research paper, we introduce the first DI-QSDC protocol that includes user identity authentication to establish the authenticity of both sender and receiver before message exchange. We also extend this approach to a DI Quantum Dialogue (QD) protocol where both parties can send secret messages upon mutual authentication.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Defense against Edge-case Model Poisoning Attacks on Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning systems are increasingly subjected to a multitude of model poisoning attacks from clients. Among these, edge-case attacks that target a small fraction of the input space are nearly impossible to detect using existing defenses, leading to a high attack success rate. We propose an effective defense using an external defense dataset, which provides information about the attack target. The defense dataset contains a mix of poisoned and clean examples, with only a few known to be clean. The proposed method, DataDefense, uses this dataset to learn a poisoned data detector model which marks each example in the defense dataset as poisoned or clean. It also learns a client importance model that estimates the probability of a client update being malicious. The global model is then updated as a weighted average of the client models' updates. The poisoned data detector and the client importance model parameters are updated using an alternating minimization strategy over the Federated Learning rounds. Extensive experiments on standard attack scenarios demonstrate that DataDefense can defend against model poisoning attacks where other state-of-the-art defenses fail. In particular, DataDefense is able to reduce the attack success rate by at least ~ 40% on standard attack setups and by more than 80% on some setups. Furthermore, DataDefense requires very few defense examples (as few as five) to achieve a near-optimal reduction in attack success rate.</description>

      <title>Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Inference Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Differential Privacy: Insights into Quantum Computing Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum computing has strong potential in data-driven fields, the privacy issue of sensitive or valuable information involved in the quantum algorithm should be considered. Differential privacy (DP), which is a fundamental privacy tool widely used in the classical scenario, has been extended to the quantum domain, i.e., quantum differential privacy (QDP). QDP may become one of the most promising approaches toward privacy-preserving quantum computing since it is not only compatible with classical DP mechanisms but also achieves privacy protection by exploiting unavoidable quantum noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This paper provides an overview of the various implementations of QDP and their performance in terms of privacy parameters under the DP setting. Specifically, we propose a taxonomy of QDP techniques, categorizing the literature on whether internal or external randomization is used as a source to achieve QDP and how these implementations are applied to each phase of the quantum algorithm. We also discuss challenges and future directions for QDP. By summarizing recent advancements, we hope to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date review for researchers venturing into this field.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Theorems for Trees and a General 'Private Learning Implies Online Learning' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work continues to investigate the link between differentially private (DP) and online learning. Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019) showed that for binary concept classes, DP learnability of a given class implies that it has a finite Littlestone dimension (equivalently, that it is online learnable). Their proof relies on a model-theoretic result by Hodges (1997), which demonstrates that any binary concept class with a large Littlestone dimension contains a large subclass of thresholds. In a follow-up work, Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020) extended this proof to multiclass PAC learning with a bounded number of labels. Unfortunately, Hodges's result does not apply in other natural settings such as multiclass PAC learning with an unbounded label space, and PAC learning of partial concept classes.
  This naturally raises the question of whether DP learnability continues to imply online learnability in more general scenarios: indeed, Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (2021) explicitly leave it as an open question in the context of partial concept classes, and the same question is open in the general multiclass setting. In this work, we give a positive answer to these questions showing that for general classification tasks, DP learnability implies online learnability. Our proof reasons directly about Littlestone trees, without relying on thresholds. We achieve this by establishing several Ramsey-type theorems for trees, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems embody significant commercial value and represent crucial intellectual property. However, the integrity of these systems is constantly challenged by malicious actors seeking to steal their underlying models. Safeguarding against such threats is paramount to upholding the rights and interests of the model owner. While model watermarking has emerged as a potent defense mechanism in various domains, its direct application to recommender systems remains unexplored and non-trivial. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing Autoregressive Out-of-distribution Watermarking (AOW), a novel technique tailored specifically for recommender systems. Our approach entails selecting an initial item and querying it through the oracle model, followed by the selection of subsequent items with small prediction scores. This iterative process generates a watermark sequence autoregressively, which is then ingrained into the model's memory through training. To assess the efficacy of the watermark, the model is tasked with predicting the subsequent item given a truncated watermark sequence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance and robust properties of AOW. Notably, our watermarking technique exhibits high-confidence extraction capabilities and maintains effectiveness even in the face of distillation and fine-tuning processes.</description>
