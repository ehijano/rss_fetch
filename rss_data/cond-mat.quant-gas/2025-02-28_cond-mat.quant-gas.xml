      <title>Elongated vortex quantum droplets in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability of elongated (``slender") quantum droplets (QDs) with embedded unitary and multiple vorticity is a problem that was not solved previously. In this work, we propose a solution which relies upon the use of the spatial modulation of the inter-species scattering length in the binary Bose-Einstein condensate, in the form of a two-dimensional axisymmetric Gaussian, shaped by means of the optical Feshbach resonance. The corresponding effective nonlinear trapping potential supports completely stable elongated QDs with vorticity $S=0$ and partly stable families of elongated QDs with $S=1,2,3,4$ (other nonlinear systems do not maintain stability of vortex droplets with $\geq 2$). We systematically analyze effects of the amplitude and width of the Gaussian modulation, as well as the total number of atoms, on the shape and stability of the QDs, some effects being explained analytically. Collisions between identical QDs with $S=1$ moving in opposite directions along the central axis leads to their merger into still more elongated breathing QDs with the same vorticity, while collisions between QDs with $S=\pm 1$ are quasi-elastic. Moving modulation profiles are able to adiabatically rotate the trapped elongated QDs. Application of a torque to the vector QD sets in the gyroscopic regime of robust precession, which realizes a macroscopic spin-orbit-coupling effect.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and large-scale structures in self-gravitating superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study turbulence in self-gravitating superfluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation, which is also a model for dark matter haloes around galaxies. In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov's $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\rm kin}^c \propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Microwave-coupled optical bistability in driven and interacting Rydberg gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics are closely related to various fields of research, in which vastly different phases emerge when parameters are changed. However, it is difficult to construct nonequilibrium systems that have sufficiently tunable controllable parameters. Using microwave field coupling induced optical bistability, Rydberg gases exhibit a range of significantly different optical responses. In conjunction with electromagnetically induced transparency, the microwave coupling can create versatile nonequilibrium dynamics. In particular, the microwave coupling of two Rydberg states provides an additional handle for controlling the dynamics. And the microwave-controlled nonequilibrium phase transition has the potential to be applied in microwave field measurement. This study opens a new avenue to exploring bistable dynamics using microwave-coupled Rydberg gases, and developing quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>Flux induced re-entrant dynamics in the quantum walk of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the QW of two interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder lattice in the presence of an artificial magnetic field. By considering an uniform flux piercing through the ladder, we show that in the limit of strong onsite repulsion and dominant rung-hopping, an initially slow dynamics becomes fast, then slow and fast again with increase in the flux strength indicating a re-entrant dynamics. This unusual behaviour is found to be associated with the formation, breaking and reformation of a bound pair state along the rung of the ladder. In addition to this we also find a re-entrant behaviour in the chiral dynamics where the chirality in the system first increases and then decreases with increase in interaction. We establish this unusual re-entrant behaviour in the dynamics by analysing the radial velocity, spreading of correlation, center-of-mass shearing and energy band diagrams.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of relative phase extraction in one-dimensional Bose gases interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Topological floating phase of dipolar bosons in an optical ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emulating Novel Topological Phases with Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a feasible scheme utilizing the Floquet engineering platform with ultracold atoms in optical lattices to emulate both pair-hopping processes and singlet/triplet pairing interactions, aiming to simulate and control novel topologically nontrivial phases. Our large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal three distinct topological regimes: (i) a Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase characterized by exponentially localized edge charges, non-local single-fermion edge correlations, a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum; (ii) a $z$-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase manifesting fractionalized edge spin; and (iii) a novel x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase exhibiting fractional edge spins along the $x$-direction and non-local single-particle edge correlations, merging characteristics of the edge states from both MS and TS phases. Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.</description>

      <title>Giant vortex in a harmonically-trapped rotating dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of dynamically stable giant vortices in a harmonically-trapped strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy Bose-Einstein condensate under rotation around the polarization direction of dipolar atoms, employing the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high atom density. These giant vortices are stationary, obtainable by imaginary-time propagation using a Gaussian initial state, while the appropriate phase of the giant vortex is imprinted on the initial wave function. The dynamical stability of the giant vortices is established by real-time propagation during a long interval of time after a small change of a parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We benchmark simulations of many-body quantum systems on heterogeneous hardware platforms using CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., NumPy versus the PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow libraries, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.</description>
