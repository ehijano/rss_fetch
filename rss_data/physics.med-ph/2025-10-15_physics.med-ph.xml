      <title>Zero-Shot Large Language Model Agents for Fully Automated Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation therapy treatment planning is an iterative, expertise-dependent process, and the growing burden of cancer cases has made reliance on manual planning increasingly unsustainable, underscoring the need for automation. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages a large language model (LLM)-based agent to navigate inverse treatment planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The LLM agent was implemented to directly interact with a clinical treatment planning system (TPS) to iteratively extract intermediate plan states and propose new constraint values to guide inverse optimization. The agent's decision-making process is informed by current observations and previous optimization attempts and evaluations, allowing for dynamic strategy refinement. The planning process was performed in a zero-shot inference setting, where the LLM operated without prior exposure to manually generated treatment plans and was utilized without any fine-tuning or task-specific training. The LLM-generated plans were evaluated on twenty head-and-neck cancer cases against clinical manual plans, with key dosimetric endpoints analyzed and reported. The LLM-generated plans achieved comparable organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing relative to clinical plans while demonstrating improved hot spot control (Dmax: 106.5% vs. 108.8%) and superior conformity (conformity index: 1.18 vs. 1.39 for boost PTV; 1.82 vs. 1.88 for primary PTV). This study demonstrates the feasibility of a zero-shot, LLM-driven workflow for automated IMRT treatment planning in a commercial TPS. The proposed approach provides a generalizable and clinically applicable solution that could reduce planning variability and support broader adoption of AI-based planning strategies.</description>

      <title>Trading robustness: a scenario-free approach to robust Multi-Criteria Optimization for Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treatment planning in radiotherapy is inherently a multi-criteria optimization (MCO) problem. Traditionally, the treatment's robustness is not formulated as a part of this decision making problem, but dealt with separately through margins or robust optimization. This work facilitates integration of robustness into multi-criteria optimization using a recently proposed efficient scenario-free (s-f) robust optimization approach: The s-f approach relies on the fast evaluation of the expected dose distribution and mean variance during optimization. This is achieved by precomputation of probabilistic quantities, which can then be used for repeated solving of subproblems in the two explored MCO approaches: Lexicographic Ordering (LO) and Pareto Front (PF) approximation. Different prioritization strategies within the LO approach are used to assess the impact of variance reduction while a 3-objective PF approximation, including a variance reduction objective, is generated to visualize and analyze trade-offs between the competing objectives. The robust optimization is performed including 100 scenarios modeling setup and range errors, as well as organ motion, on 3D- and 4DCT lung cancer patient datasets. Robustness analysis is performed to assess and explore the efficacy of all optimization strategies. The s-f approach enabled robust optimization in MCO with computational times comparable to nominal MCO. Both MCO strategies highlighted the interplay between dosimetric and variance reduction objectives. The LO approach showed how prioritization affects plan quality and robustness, while the PF analysis revealed a clear trade-off between robustness and organ-at-risk sparing. The reported analysis highlighted the conflicting trade-off nature of plan robustness and dosimetric quality, demonstrating how robust MCO supports a more informed and flexible decision-making process in treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Quasi-static in vivo elastography from internal displacement information only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As disease often alters the structural properties of soft tissue, noninvasive elastography techniques have emerged to quantitatively assess in vivo mechanical properties. Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) based on dynamic deformations is the standard technique for imaging mechanical properties, but the viscoelastic nature of soft tissue makes the results dependent on the actuation frequency, which can be limiting. In this proof-of-principle study we propose a noise robust framework for reconstructing relative stiffness properties from quasi-static in vivo displacement fields captured on a physiological time scale. The acquisition is performed using a pneumatic pressure cuff to induce tissue deformation in a controlled manner. The reconstruction does not require boundary information which is generally hard to access in vivo nor spatial derivatives of displacement fields that are known to amplify noise. The validity of our framework is corroborated with in silico experiments on a numerical phantom. In vivo experiments on the thigh of a volunteer demonstrate the repeatability of the method. As an application, the quantitative change in muscle stiffness during isometric knee flexion is investigated which yielded physiologically meaningful results.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic Medical Tissue Imaging Using Probabilistic Inversion: Leveraging Variational Inference for Speed Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a promising technique for achieving high-resolution imaging in medical ultrasound. However, conventional FWI methods suffer from issues related to computational efficiency, dependence on initial models, and the inability to quantify uncertainty. This study aims to enhance inversion performance and provide a reliable method for uncertainty quantification in medical FWI imaging. This study integrates the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm into the FWI framework by deriving the posterior gradient for probabilistic inversion. To evaluate the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets, including a breast tissue model with realistic anatomical structure. Imaging accuracy and uncertainty quantification are assessed to compare the performance of SVGD-based FWI with conventional FWI and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) methods. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is implemented as a benchmark to evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates. For synthetic data, the SVGD-based FWI framework yields more precise estimates in the region of interest (ROI) and demonstrates faster convergence compared to the conventional FWI. For the anatomically realistic breast tissue simulation, SVGD produces a maximum relative error of 1.10\% and a mean relative error of 0.09\% in the ROI. The estimated uncertainty is spatially consistent, with most values below 0.01 and a mean of approximately 0.003. Compared to SVI, SVGD provides improved structural resolution and stronger agreement with the MCMC benchmark, indicating more reliable uncertainty quantification. The SVGD-based FWI method improves inversion quality, enhances uncertainty quantification. These findings indicate that probabilistic inversion is a promising tool for addressing the limitations of traditional FWI methods in ultrasonic imaging of medical tissues.</description>

      <title>A double multi-turn injection scheme for generating mixed helium and carbon ion beams at medical synchrotron facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low relative charge-to-mass ratio offset of 0.065% between fully ionized helium-4 and carbon-12 ions enables simultaneous acceleration in hadron therapy synchrotrons. At the same energy per mass, helium ions exhibit a stopping range approximately three times greater than carbon ions. They can therefore be exploited for online range verification downstream of the patient during carbon ion beam irradiation. One possibility for creating this mixed beam is accelerating the two ion species sequentially through the LINAC and subsequently "mixing" them at injection energy in the synchrotron with a double multi-turn injection scheme. This work reports the first successful generation, acceleration, and extraction of a mixed helium and carbon ion beam using this double multi-turn injection scheme, which was achieved at the MedAustron therapy accelerator in Austria. A description of the double multi-turn injection scheme, particle tracking simulations, and details on the implementation at the MedAustron accelerator facility are presented and discussed. Finally, measurements of the mixed beam at delivery in the irradiation room using a radiochromic film and a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) detector are presented.</description>

      <title>Impact of Oxygen on DNA Damage Distribution in 3D Genome and Its Correlation to Oxygen Enhancement Ratio under High LET Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variation of the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) across Linear Energy Transfer (LET) currently lacks a comprehensive mechanistic interpretation and a mechanistic model. Our earlier research revealed a significant correlation between the distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs) within 3D genome and radiation-induced cell death, which offers valuable insights into the oxygen effect. We propose a model where the reaction of oxygen is represented as the probability of inducing DNA strand breaks. Then it is integrated into a track-structure Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the impact of oxygen on the distribution of DSBs within 3D genome. Using the parameters from our previous study, we calculate the OER values related to cell survival. Results show that the incidence ratios of clustered DSBs in a single topologically associating domain (TAD) (case 2) and DSBs in frequently-interacting TADs (case 3) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions align with the trend of the OER of cell survival across LET. Our OER curves exhibit good correspondence with experimental data. This study provides a potentially mechanistic explanation for changes in OER across LET. High-LET irradiation leads to dense ionization events, resulting in an overabundance of lesions that readily induce case 2 and case 3, which have substantially higher probabilities of cell killing than other damage patterns. This may contribute to the main mechanism governing the variation of OER for high LET. Our study further underscores the importance of the DSB distribution within 3D genome in the context of radiation-induced cell death.</description>

      <title>Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\pm$90$^{\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\sim$200 MBq to $\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\theta_{1,2}\in[72^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\Delta\phi=90^{\circ}\pm20^{\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\mu$, gaining $\sim$50\% in value during the experiment.</description>
