      <title>Jupiter's ultraviolet auroral bridge: the influence of the solar wind on polar auroral morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora frequently shows a number of arcs between the dusk-side polar region and the main emission, which are denoted as ``bridges''. This work presents a largely automated detection and statistical analysis of bridges over 248 Hubble-Space-Telescope observations, alongside a multi-instrument study of crossings of magnetic field lines connected to bridges by the Juno spacecraft during its first 30 perijoves. Bridges are observed to arise on timescales of $\sim$2 hours, can persist over a full Jupiter rotation, and are conjugate between hemispheres. The appearance of bridges is strongly associated with compression of the magnetosphere by the solar wind. Low-altitude bridge crossings are associated with upward-dominated, broadband electron distributions, consistent with Zone-II aurorae, as well as with plasma-wave bursts observed by Juno-Waves, in agreement with existing theoretical models for the generation of polar-region aurorae. Electron populations associated with crossings of field lines threading the main emission by Juno also become more downward-dominated when separate bridges are present in the nearby aurora. In all, this indicates that bridges are likely Zone-II aurorae that have become spatially separated from the Zone-I aurorae under the influence of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Topological ignition of the stealth coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy release events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is often assumed recently that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection, when the magnetic null point is produced by a specific superposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current systems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model explains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma eruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of reconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection (magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic field sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are usually strongly curved, which can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb.</description>
