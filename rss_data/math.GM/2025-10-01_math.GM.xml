      <title>Learning the Maximum of a H\"older Function from Inexact Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Optimal Recovery, one determines in this article the {\em best} procedures to learn a quantity of interest depending on a H\"older function acquired via inexact point evaluations at fixed datasites. {\em Best} here refers to procedures minimizing worst-case errors. The elementary arguments hint at the possibility of tackling nonlinear quantities of interest, with a particular focus on the function maximum. In a local setting, i.e., for a fixed data vector, the optimal procedure (outputting the so-called Chebyshev center) is precisely described relatively to a general model of inexact evaluations. Relatively to a slightly more restricted model and in a global setting, i.e., uniformly over all data vectors, another optimal procedure is put forward, showing how to correct the natural underestimate that simply returns the data vector maximum. Jitterred data are also briefly discussed as a side product of evaluating the minimal worst-case error optimized over the datasites.</description>

      <title>Application of a new iterative formula for computing $\pi$ and nested radicals with roots of $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain an iterative formula that can be used for computing digits of $\pi$ and nested radicals of kind $c_n/\sqrt{2 - c_{n - 1}}$, where $c_0 = 0$ and $c_n = \sqrt{2 + c_{n - 1}}$. We also show how with help of this iterative formula the two-term Machin-like formulas for $\pi$ can be generated and approximated. Some examples with Mathematica codes are presented.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four types of homogeneity - additive, multiplicative, exponential, and logarithmic - are generalized as transformations describing how a function $f$ changes under scaling or shifting of its arguments. These generalized homogeneity functions capture different scaling behaviors and establish fundamental properties.
  Such properties include how homogeneity is preserved under function operations and how it determines the transformation behavior of related constructions like quotient functions. This framework extends the classical concept of homogeneity to a wider class of functional symmetries, providing a unified approach to analyzing scaling properties in various mathematical contexts.</description>

      <title>Simuorb: a new method for generating and describing the intersection points of clique-arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work, which may be seen as a companion paper to \cite{RS2}, handles the way the intersection points made by the diagonals of a regular polygon are distributed. It was stated recently by the authors that these points lie exclusively on circles centered on the origin and also the way their respective radii depend on the four indices of the vertices of the initial regular $n$-gon which characterize the two straight lines underlying the intersection points. Because these four vertices are located at preset positions on the the regular $n$-gon inscribed in the unit circle whose path-length perimeter is constant, it allows the orbits to be characterized by 3 parameters instead of 4, describing roughly the lengths of the paths between the first three vertices, whether the quadrilateral described by these four vertices is simple or complex.
  This approach enables us to deal with the orbits generated by the clique-arrangement, and to handle their cardinalities as well as the multiplicities of the associated intersection points. A reliable counting-algorithm based on this triplet strategy is provided in order to enumerate the intersection points without generating the associated graph. The orbits being simulated, we call this method \textit{Simuorb}. The procedure is robust, fast and allows a comprehensive understanding of what is happening in a clique-arrangement, whether it contains a large number of points or not.</description>

      <title>An Alternate Method for Finding Particular Solutions of Nonhomegeneous Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note we are presenting a method of finding particular solutions of nonhomegeneous linear equations. This approach is different from methods of undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters presented in virtually every standard Differential Equations textbook.</description>
