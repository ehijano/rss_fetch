      <title>Tunable Random Telegraph Noise in Stable Perpendicular Magnetic Tunnel Junctions for Unconventional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that thermally stable perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), widely used in spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory, can be actuated with nanosecond pulses to exhibit tunable stochastic behavior. This actuated-stochastic tunnel junction (A-sMTJ) concept produces random telegraph noise, with control over fluctuation rate and probability bias. The device response is shown to be consistent with a Poisson process, with fluctuation rates tunable over more than two orders of magnitude, with average state dwell times varying from 29 ns to greater than 2.3 microseconds. These results establish A-sMTJs as a versatile platform for integrating deterministic, stochastic, and in-memory functionality on a single chip, advancing the development of probabilistic, neuromorphic, and unconventional computing systems.</description>

      <title>Superparamagnetic and Stochastic-Write Magnetic Tunnel Junctions for High-Speed True Random Number Generation in Advanced Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review two magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) approaches for compact, low-power, CMOS-integrated true random number generation (TRNG). The first employs passive-read, easy-plane superparamagnetic MTJs (sMTJs) that generate thermal-fluctuation-driven bit streams at $0.5$--$1$~Gb/s per device. The second uses MTJs with magnetically stable free layers, operated with stochastic write pulses to achieve switching probabilities of about $0.5$ (\emph{i.e.}, write error rates of $\simeq 0.5$), achieving $\gtrsim 0.1$~Gb/s per device; we refer to these as stochastic-write MTJs (SW-MTJs). Randomness from both approaches has been validated using the NIST~SP800 test suites. The sMTJ approach uses a read-only cell with low power and can be compatible with most advanced CMOS nodes, while SW-MTJs leverage standard CMOS MTJ process flows, enabling co-integration with embedded spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM). Both approaches can achieve deep sub-0.01~$\mu$m$^2$ MTJ footprints and offer orders-of-magnitude better energy efficiency than CPU/GPU-based generators, enabling placement near logic for high-throughput random bit-streams for probabilistic computing, statistical modeling, and cryptography. In terms of performance, sMTJs generally suit applications requiring very high data-rate random bits near logic processors, such as probabilistic computing or large-scale statistical modeling. By contrast, SW-MTJs are an attractive option for edge-oriented microcontrollers, providing entropy sources for computing or cryptographic enhancement. We highlight the strengths, limitations, and integration challenges of each approach, emphasizing the need to reduce device-to-device variability in sMTJs -- particularly by mitigating magnetostriction-induced in-plane anisotropy -- and to improve temporal stability in SW-MTJs for robust, large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>Bilayer graphene quantum dots as a quantum simulator of Haldane topological quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate here that a chain of Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots (BLGQD) can realize topological quantum matter by effectively simulating a spin-1 chain that hosts the Haldane phase within a specific range of parameters. We describe a chain of BLGQD with two electrons each using an atomistic tight-binding model combined with the exact diagonalization technique to solve the interacting few-electron problem. Coulomb interactions and valley mixing effects are treated within the same microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.</description>

      <title>Axial Hall Effect in Altermagnetic Lieb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a so-called axial Hall effect, a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall response, in Lieb-lattice altermagnets. By constructing a tight-binding model, we identify the axial direction as a hidden topological degree of freedom. Breaking the double degeneracy of axial symmetry generates substantial Berry curvature and induces a pronounced anomalous Hall conductivity. First-principles calculations further confirm the emergence of this effect in strained altermagnets, particularly in ternary transition-metal dichalcogenides. We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall effect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading to highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of the axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the strain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom. Finally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive thickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses. These findings emphasize the critical role of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear spin textures in altermagnets, an area that has received limited attention, and open new pathways for exploring intrinsic Hall phenomena in topological magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Crystal Orientation Dependence of Extreme Near-Field Heat Transfer between Polar Materials Governed by Surface Phonon Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rapid development of micro- and nano-manufacturing and electronic devices, heat transfer at the transition regime between radiation and conduction becomes increasingly important. Recent work has demonstrated the importance of nonlocal optical response and phonon tunneling. However, it remains unclear how the crystal orientation impacts them. In this work, we study this effect on heat transport across vacuum gaps between magnesium oxide (MgO) by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. At 5~\AA~gaps, the overall thermal conductance exhibits 30\% enhancement for [100] orientation versus [110] and [210], while becoming orientation-insensitive beyond 6~\AA. When the gap size is extremely small, the crystal orientation significantly impacts the resonance frequencies of spectral thermal conductance which are quite close to those of unique surface phonon modes distinct from bulk counterparts. As the gap size gradually increases, the spectral thermal conductance gradually converges to the predicted results of fluctuation-electrodynamics (FE) theory in the long-wavelength approximation. Our findings reveal how surface phonon modes govern extreme near-field heat transfer across nanogap, providing insights for thermal management in electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional magnetization textures as quaternionic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent progress in bulk full three-dimensional nanoscale magnetization distribution imaging, there is a growing interest to three-dimensional (3D) magnetization textures, promising new high information density spintronic applications. Compared to 1D domain walls or 2D magnetic vortices/skyrmions, they are a much harder challenge to represent, analyze and reason about. In this Letter we build analytical representation for such a textures (with arbitrary number of singularity-free hopfions and singular Bloch point pairs) as products of simple quaternionic functions. It can be useful as a language for expressing theoretical models of 3D magnetization textures and specifying a variety of topologically non-trivial initial conditions for micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent signatures of Majorana modes in thermoelectric transport through double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire and ferromagnetic leads. The study focuses on the behavior of the Seebeck coefficient and its spin-resolved counterparts, with calculations performed by means of the numerical renormalization group method. We investigate the low-temperature transport regime, where a complex interplay between the two-stage Kondo effect, the ferromagnet-induced exchange field, and the Majorana coupling occurs. We demonstrate that thermoelectric measurements can reveal unique signatures of the Majorana interaction that are challenging to isolate in conductance measurements alone. It is shown that the exchange field fundamentally alters the thermoelectric response, leading to a rich, non-monotonic temperature evolution of the thermopower, which is driven by a temperature-dependent competition between the spin channels. Furthermore, we have identified qualitatively different regimes of spin thermopower generation, controlled by the interplay between the Majorana-induced asymmetry and the spin polarization of the leads. Finally, by connecting the system's thermoelectric response to the underlying transport asymmetries quantified by the conductance spin polarization, we provide a consistent and unified physical picture, proposing thermoelectric transport as a sensitive probe for Majorana signatures.</description>

      <title>Field-free transverse Josephson diode effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that altermagnets (AMs) with Rashba spin--orbit coupling can host a transverse Josephson diode effect (TJDE) without any external magnetic field. AMs combine zero net magnetization with spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, enabling the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose a four-terminal Josephson junction where a longitudinal phase bias between opposite superconducting terminals generates transverse supercurrents in the unbiased terminals. These transverse currents exhibit both a diode-like nonreciprocity and a finite anomalous phase offset, revealing a transverse anomalous Josephson effect (AJE). For certain parameter regimes, the transverse current becomes unidirectional, and the TJDE efficiency can exceed 1000\%, demonstrating exceptionally strong diode behavior. Remarkably, the magnitude and direction of the TJDE and transverse AJE are tunable by rotating the N\'eel vector. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for engineering field-free nonreciprocal superconducting transport in multiterminal devices.</description>

      <title>Twist-modulated magnetic interactions in bilayer van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control magnetic interactions at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of next-generation spintronic devices and functional magnetic materials. In this work, we investigate theoretically, by means of many-body perturbation theory, how interlayer twisting modulates magnetic interactions in bilayer van der Waals systems composed of two ferromagnetic layers. We demonstrate that the relative strengths of the interlayer Heisenberg exchange interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the anisotropic exchange interaction can be significantly altered by varying the twist angle between the layers, thus leading to tunable magnetic textures. We further show that these interactions are strongly dependent on the chemical potential, enabling additional control via electrostatic gating or doping. Importantly, our approach is applicable to arbitrary twist angles and does not rely on the construction of a Moir\'e supercell, making it particularly efficient even at small twist angles.</description>

      <title>Nematic Enhancement of Superconductivity in Multilayer Graphene via Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer graphene materials have recently emerged as a fascinating versatile platform for correlated electron phenomena, hosting superconductivity, fractional quantum Hall states, and correlated insulating phases. A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring correlation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous breaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust superconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials, devices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic explanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic order to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry breaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level, producing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum metric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by the quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G. Shavit \it{et al.}, \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.176001}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 176001 (2025)}]. Our analysis reveals that nematicity naturally boosts the superconducting coupling constant in experimentally relevant density regimes, providing a compelling explanation for observed correlations. These results establish the central role of geometric effects in graphene superconductivity and highlight nematicity as a promising avenue for engineering stronger unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the symmetry resolution of a multipartite entanglement measure, namely the global entanglement $Q$ introduced by Meyer and Wallach [2002, J. of Math. Phys., 43, pp. 4273] for all systems of distinguishable particles hosting a locally acting symmetry. For an ensemble of Haar random states we find agreement with equipartition, with leading order behaviour and finite size corrections which follow a power law scaling with the number of local degrees of freedom. Implications of this result for the general symmetry-resolved multipartite entanglement paradigm are discussed and some possible experimental verification methods are presented.</description>

      <title>Proximity Ferroelectricity in Compositionally Graded Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity in a non-ferroelectric polar material such as AlN or ZnO that are typically unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown field. When placed in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer (such as Al1-xScxN or Zn1-xMgxO), they become a practically switchable ferroelectric. Using the thermodynamic Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, in this work we performed the finite element modeling of the polarization switching in the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN, ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO and MgO-Zn1-xMgxO structures sandwiched in both a parallel-plate capacitor geometry as well as in a sharp probe-planar electrode geometry. We reveal that the compositionally graded structure allows the simultaneous switching of spontaneous polarization in the whole system by a coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field of unswitchable polar materials. The physical mechanism is the depolarization electric field determined by the gradient of chemical composition "x". The field lowers the steepness of the switching barrier in the otherwise unswitchable parts of the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN and ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures, while it induces a shallow double-well free energy potential in the MgO-like regions of compositionally graded MgO-Zn1-xMgxO structure. Proximity ferroelectric switching of the compositionally graded structures placed in the probe-electrode geometry occurs due to nanodomain formation under the tip. We predict that a gradient of chemical composition "x" significantly lowers effective coercive fields of the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN and ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures compared to the coercive fields of the corresponding multilayers with a uniform chemical composition in each layer.</description>

      <title>Persistent Interfacial Topological Hall Effect Demonstrating Electrical Readout of Topological Spin Structures in Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional topological Hall effects (THE) require conducting magnets, leaving insulating systems largely inaccessible. Here we introduce the interfacial topological Hall effect (ITHE), where the noncoplanar spin textures of insulating magnets are imprinted onto an adjacent heavy metal via the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) and detected electrically. In Pt/h-LuFeO3 bilayers, h-LuFeO3 hosts a topological spin structure robust against high magnetic fields, arising from a 120{\deg} triangular spin lattice with small spin canting that yields nontrivial topology but minimal magnetization. This generates a giant Hall response in Pt up to 0.5% of the longitudinal resistivity and a Hall-conductivity/magnetization ratio above 2 V^{-1}, clearly distinguishable from the spin Hall Hanle effect background. Field- and temperature-dependent analysis further reveals that Pt nanoclusters inherit topological textures from h-LuFeO3 via MPE. Unlike the conventional THE narrow peak-and-dip features, ITHE in Pt/h-LuFeO3 persists across a broad magnetic field range up to 14 T, demonstrating the exceptional stability of the underlying topological spin structure. This establishes ITHE as a powerful and sensitive probe for topological magnetism in ultrathin insulating films and paves the way for new spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Valley-Selective Linear Dichroism and Excitonic Effects in Lieb-Lattice Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently been recognized as a distinct class of magnetic materials characterized by alternative spin-split electronic structures without net magnetization. Despite intensive studies on their single-particle spintronic and valleytronic properties, many-electron interactions and optical responses of altermagnets remain less explored. In this work, we employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate excited states and their strain tunability. Using monolayer Mn2WS4 as a representative candidate, we uncover a novel spin valley-dependent excitonic selection rule in two-dimensional altermagnetic Lieb lattices. In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find that linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized excitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry and electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can lift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized excitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal dichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain tunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to encode, store, and read valley/spin information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain topological systems with time-varying Hamiltonian enable quantized and disorder-robust transport of excitations. Here, we introduce the modification of the celebrated Thouless pump when the on-site energies remain fixed, while the nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings vary in time. We demonstrate quantized transport of excitations and propose an experimental implementation using an array of evanescently coupled optical waveguides.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Limits of MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$: Revisiting High-Order Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. Yet, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \textsc{HIPHIVE} against density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\kappa$. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Fate of Topological Dirac Magnons in van der Waals Ferromagnets at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac magnons, the bosonic counterparts of Dirac fermions in graphene, provide a unique platform to explore symmetry-protected band crossings and quantum geometry in magnetic insulators, while promising high-velocity, low-dissipation spin transport for next-generation magnonic technologies. However, their stability under realistic, finite-temperature conditions remains an open question. Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of thermal magnon-magnon interactions in van der Waals honeycomb ferromagnets, focusing on both gapless and gapped Dirac magnons. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory with magnon self-energy corrections and a T-matrix resummation that captures two-magnon bound states, we quantitatively reproduce temperature- and momentum-dependent energy shifts and linewidths observed experimentally in the gapless Dirac magnon material CrBr$_3$, even near the Curie temperature. Our approach resolves discrepancies between prior theoretical predictions and experiment and highlight the significant role of bound states in enhancing magnon damping at low temperatures. For gapped Dirac magnon materials such as CrI$_3$, CrSiTe$_3$, and CrGeTe$_3$, we find a thermally induced reduction of the topological magnon gap but no evidence of thermally driven topological transitions. Classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations corroborate the gap' s robustness up to the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we establish a practical criterion for observing topological gaps by determining the minimum ratio of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to Heisenberg exchange required to overcome thermal broadening throughout the ordered phase, typically around 5%. Our results clarify the interplay of thermal many-body effects and topology in low-dimensional magnets and provide a reliable framework for interpreting spectroscopic experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and Dynamics of High-Fidelity Two-Qubit Gates with Electrons on Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of individual electrons electrostatically trapped on condensed noble gas surfaces have recently attracted considerable interest as potential platforms for quantum computing. The electrons form the qubits of the system, and the purity of the noble gas surface protects the relevant quantum properties of each electron. Previous work has indicated that manipulation of a confining double-well potential for electrons on superfluid helium can generate entanglement suitable for two-qubit gate operations. In this work, we incorporate a time-dependent tuning of the potential shape to further explore operation of two-qubit gates with the superfluid helium system. Through numerical time evolution, we show that fast, high-fidelity two-qubit gates can be achieved. In particular, we simulate operation of the \sqiswap and CZ gates and obtain fidelities of 0.999 and 0.996 with execution times of 2.9~ns and 9.4~ns, respectively. Furthermore, we examine the stability of these gate fidelities under non-ideal execution conditions, which reveals new properties to consider in the device design. With the insights gained from this work, we believe that an experimental realization of two-qubit gates using electrons on helium is feasible.</description>

      <title>Characterization of superconducting germanide and germanosilicide films of Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir formed by solid-phase epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facilitated by recent advances in strained Ge/SiGe quantum well (QW) growth technology, superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices based on group IV materials have been developed, potentially augmenting the functionality of quantum circuits. The formation of highly transparent superconducting platinum germanosilicide (PtSiGe) contacts to Ge/SiGe heterostructures by solid-phase epitaxy between Pt and SiGe has recently been reported, although with a relatively low critical temperature $&lt;1\,\mathrm{K}$. Here, we present a comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir germanides, along with an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by solid-phase epitaxy. For films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, we report $T_\mathrm{c}=3.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($2.6\,\mathrm{K}$ for IrGe (IrSiGe). High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveal that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface.</description>

Abstract: We consider chiral, generally nonlinear density waves in one dimension, modelling the bosonized edge modes of a two-dimensional fermionic topological insulator. Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics on an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time produce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These phases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a diagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor as a necessary element in the geometric classification of nonlinear responses and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of monovalent cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. Specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate both magnon and photon blockade for an antiferromagnetic insulator coupled to a linearly polarized cavity mode. We focus on the cross-Kerr nonlinearity between the two magnon modes, which can be large in antiferromagnets with a weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy. By numerically solving the Lindblad master equations, we demonstrate that the resulting bright and dark modes, i.e., system eigenmodes that couple strongly and weakly to photons, respectively, exhibit distinct behaviors. The bright mode exhibits both magnon and photon blockade due to a weak effective nonlinearity, while the dark mode only exhibits magnon blockade for a detuned cavity photon. The blockade efficiency can further be optimized by appropriately tuning the competing interactions in the system. In addition, we show that applying a DC magnetic field, which lifts the degeneracy of antiferromagnetic chiral magnon eigenmodes, destroys the dark mode and leads to an unconventional photon blockade. These findings provide a pathway for generating single magnon and photon states useful for quantum information technology based on the underlying large squeezing of antiferromagnetic magnons.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in harnessing non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics. A key requirement for their practical use is the ability to control the spin order in a reliable and tunable manner. In this work, we investigate how the spin order in kagome antiferromagnets -- an important class of NCAFMs -- can be manipulated via strain. Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive an effective action for the kagome antiferromagnet that captures the coupling between the spin order and the system's strain tensor. At the microscopic level, this coupling arises from strain-induced modifications of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and exchange interactions. Using this effective description, we explore two strain-driven phenomena: (1) strain-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic spin order and (2) the piezomagnetic response. We numerically show that strain facilitates thermally assisted switching between spin configurations of opposite chirality. Specifically, we find that uniform tensile and compressive strain govern both the average switching time and the preferred switching direction between chiral states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strain induces a net magnetization and provide an experimentally testable prediction of this effect for a typical NCAFM. Our results provide a theoretical framework for modeling strain-induced manipulation of kagome antiferromagnets, underscoring strain as a promising route for functional control of NCAFMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field is well known. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene, which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit analytical expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</description>

Abstract: We propose a bosonic quantum breakdown Hubbard model, which generalizes the Bose-Hubbard model by adding an asymmetric breakdown interaction turning one boson into two between adjacent sites. When the normal hopping is zero, this model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, and we show that the ground state undergoes a first-order phase transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a spontaneously symmetry breaking (SSB) breakdown condensate as the breakdown interaction increases. Surprisingly, the SSB breakdown condensate does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable SSB in one dimension. Moreover, we show that the quench dynamics of a boson added to MI exhibits a dynamical transition from dielectric to breakdown phases, which happens at a larger breakdown interaction than the ground state phase transition. Between these two transitions, the MI (dielectric) state is a false vacuum stable against dynamical breakdown. Our results reveal that quantum models with unconventional symmetries such as the exponential symmetry can exhibit unexpected properties.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spectral signatures of non-Markovianity beyond the Born-Redfield master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01722</link>

Abstract: Memory or time-non-local effects in open quantum dynamics pose theoretical as well as practical challenges in the understanding and control of noisy quantum systems. While there has been a comprehensive and concerted effort towards developing diagnostics for non-Markovian dynamics, all existing measures rely on time-domain measurements which are typically slow and expensive as they require averaging several runs to resolve small transient features on a broad background, and scale unfavorably with system size and complexity. In this work, we propose a spectroscopic measure of non-Markovianity which can detect persistent non-Markovianity in the system steady state. In addition to being experimentally viable, the proposed measure has a direct information theoretic interpretation: a large value indicates the information loss per unit bandwidth of making the Markov approximation. In the same vein, we derive a frequency-domain quantum master equation (FD-QME) that goes beyond the standard Born-Redfield description and retains the full memory of the state of the reduced system. Using the FD-QME and the proposed measure, we are able to reliably diagnose and quantify non-Markovianity in several system-environment settings including those with environmental correlations and retardation effects.</description>

      <title>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.</description>
