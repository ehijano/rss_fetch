      <title>Seasonal Prediction with Neural GCM and Simplified Boundary Forcings: Large-scale Atmospheric Variability and Tropical Cyclone Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using NeuralGCM, a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at initialization. With such forcings, NeuralGCM simulates realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. Furthermore, this configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July-November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the prediction skill for TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins is comparable to existing physical models. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.</description>

      <title>Structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the United States (2000 to 2025) using a large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000 to 2025, including the year, season, state, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, and purpose. Using OpenAI's o4-mini large language model (LLM), combined with multi-stage PDF-to-text conversion and response-parsing code, we processed 836 historical reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to extract the data. The resulting dataset achieved 94.72% human-verified accuracy across all fields and is publicly available on Zenodo. Our results address the gap in accessible cloud seeding data in the United States, and demonstrate the potential of LLMs to extract structured environmental data from historical documents. More broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data from scanned documents across scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Ekman Theory with Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed Ekman spirals in the ocean are always "flatter" than that predicted by the classic theory. We propose that the universal flattening of Ekman spiral is mainly due to the damping associated with turbulent dissipation. Analytical solutions and numerical simulations show convincingly a better fitting between the new theory and observations. Most importantly, the new theory indicates that the damping can lead to weakened Ekman transport and pumping, with the latter not only driven by the curl but also the divergence of wind stress. Under a modest damping, the Ekman transport along 26.5{\deg}N will be ~0.4 Sv (12%) smaller than that predicted by the classic theory. Hence, the damping due to turbulent dissipation can noticeably affect the wind-driven circulation in the upper ocean.</description>

      <title>Windows of opportunity in subseasonal weather regime forecasting: A statistical-dynamical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MJO and SPV are prominent sources of subseasonal predictability in the Extratropics. With relevance for European weather it has been shown that the joint interaction of MJO and the SPV can modulate the preferred phase of the NAO and the occurrence of weather regimes. However, improving extended-range NWP at three-week lead times remain under-explored. This study investigates how MJO and SPV phases affect Greenland Blocking (GL) activity and integrates atmospheric state information into a neural network to enhance week-three weather regime activity forecasts. We define a weather regime activity metric using ECMWF reanalysis and reforecasts. In reanalyses we find increased GL activity following MJO phases 7,8 and 1, as well as weak SPV phases, indicating climatological windows of opportunity in line with previous studies. However, ECMWF forecast skill improves only in MJO phases 8 and 1 and weak SPV phases, identifying somewhat different model windows of opportunities. Next we explore using these findings in post-processing tools. Climatological forecasts based on MJO/SPV-NAO relationships provide a purely statistical approach to extended-range GL activity forecasting, independent of NWP models. Notably, MJO conditioned climatological forecasts show clear signals when evaluated against observed GL activity. Statistical-dynamical models, using neural networks that combine historical atmospheric state data with NWP-derived weather regime metrics improve weather regime activity forecasts across all regimes considered, achieving an absolute accuracy increase of 2.9% in forecasting the dominant weather regime compared to ECMWF. This is particularly beneficial to Blocking in the European domain, where NWP models often underperform. Atmospheric conditioned and neural network forecasts serve as valuable decision-support tools alongside NWP models, enhancing the reliability of S2S predictions.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Changes During Natural Disaster: Case Study of a Dust Storm and a Volcanic Eruption Using Space and Ground Based Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates atmospheric changes during natural disasters, focusing on case studies of a dust storm in Ahmedabad and a volcanic eruption at Moun Ruang. Using the MICROTOPS-II sunphotometer from May 15 to June 19, 2024, the Ozone column, water column height, and Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) were measured. Ozone levels followed a diurnal cycle, peaking in the afternoon due to vehicular emissions and increased solar radiation, while water column depth rose with temperature, reflecting higher humidity and evaporation. AOT values increased due to boundary layer dynamics and urban emissions, peaking during rush hours and cloudy conditions. The dust storm in Ahmedabad on May 13, 2024, highlighted the influence of seasonal variations on dust storm frequency and their impact on atmospheric stability. Ceilometer backscatter data revealed significant boundary layer disruptions and enhanced aerosol mixing, with two obstruction layers identified at 100m and 2500m due to dust and clouds respectively. OMI-Aura satellite data showed a decrease in longwave radiation flux, aligning with observed cooling and increased humidity. The volcanic eruption at Mount Ruang on April 17, 2024, released substantial tephra and aerosols, enhancing cloud formation and decreasing surface temperature. Landsat-9 OLI-II data indicated significant changes in vegetation and cloud cover post-eruption, while OMI-Aura captured elevated SO2 levels as well as an 8.5% decrease in the ozone mixing ratio due to chlorine emissions. Our findings underscore the critical role of aerosols in climate modulation, acting as cloud condensation nuclei and influencing longwave radiation flux.</description>

      <title>Wildfire Smoke -- A Rigorous Challenge for HVAC Air Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant air quality challenge as the smoke they produce can travel long distances and infiltrate indoor spaces. HVAC filters serve as a primary defense against this threat. In our study, we tested over 17 different types of commercially available filter media, including charged and uncharged synthetic, as well as fiberglass media, from leading global manufacturers, to assess their efficiency in removing smoke, using pine needle smoke as a proxy for wildfire smoke. Our findings revealed that charged polymer media, across all tested MERV grades, showed a rapid decline in smoke removal efficiency within minutes while causing no increase in airflow resistance. In contrast, mechanical media demonstrated more stable performance but experienced an increase in airflow resistance. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we examined smoke deposition on fiber media, revealing unique interactions that contribute to the decline in filtration performance. These results suggest the need to reconsider current standards - whose testing is centered around inorganic particle removal - and the applicability of their ratings to smoke filtration. Our study also highlights the critical need to develop standard testing methods and evaluation criteria specific to smoke particles in HVAC filters to better protect human occupants during wildfire events.</description>

      <title>CoDiCast: Conditional Diffusion Model for Global Weather Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05975v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is critical for science and society. Yet, existing methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high accuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to quantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble forecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed. However, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate. Nevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of weather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion model to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving uncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational cost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse denoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to generate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising step is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts are achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent uncertainty quantification. CoDiCast is trained on a decade of ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing data-driven methods in accuracy. Our conditional diffusion model, CoDiCast, can generate 6-day global weather forecasts, at 6-hour steps and $5.625^\circ$ latitude-longitude resolution, for over 5 variables, in about 12 minutes on a commodity A100 GPU machine with 80GB memory. The open-souced code is provided at https://github.com/JimengShi/CoDiCast.</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the "return stroke"-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed `Main pulse' shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component-type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a unique mode of charge transfer with a range of junction length-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>
