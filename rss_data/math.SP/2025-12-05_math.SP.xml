      <title>${\sL}$-resolvents and pseudo-spectral functions of symmetric linear relations in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a closed symmetric operator with the deficiency index $(p,p)$, $p&lt;\infty$, acting in a Hilbert space $\sH$ and let $\sL$ be a subspace of $\sH$. The set of $\sL$-resolvents of a densely defined symmetric operator in a Hilbert space with a proper gauge $\sL(\subset\sH)$ was described by Kre\u{\i}n and Saakyan. The Kre\u{\i}n--Saakyan theory of $\sL$-resolvent matrices was extended by Shmul'yan and Tsekanovskii to the case of improper gauge $\sL(\not\subset\sH)$ and by Langer and Textorius to the case of symmetric linear relations in Hilbert spaces. In the present paper we find connections between the theory of boundary triples and the Kre\u{\i}n--Saakyan theory of $\sL$-resolvent matrices for symmetric linear relations with improper gauges in Hilbert spaces and extend the known formula for the $\sL$-resolvent matrix in terms of boundary operators to this class of relations. Descriptions of spectral and pseudo-spectral functions of symmetric linear relations with improper gauges are given. The results are applied to linear relations generated by a canonical system.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet heat trace for domains with curved corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the short-time asymptotics of the Dirichlet heat trace on planar curvilinear polygons. For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $\kappa^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $\alpha$ and on the limiting curvatures $\kappa_{\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(\alpha)\,r_0(\alpha,\kappa_+, \kappa_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(\alpha)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right-angled corners we compute $c_{1/2}(\pi/2)=1/(16\sqrt{\pi})$ and obtain a closed formula for the $t^{1/2}$ coefficient. As an application we extend a previous result in the literature by showing that any admissible curvilinear polygon that is Dirichlet isospectral to a polygon must itself be a polygon with straight sides.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Krein-Feller Type Operators and Applications in Stochastic Fractional Elliptic and Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that the space $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$, introduced in Simas and Sousa (Potential Analysis, 2025), is the natural regularity space for solutions of the eigenvalue problem $\Delta_{W,V} u = \lambda u$ on the torus $\mathbb{T}$, where $\Delta_{W,V} = \frac{d^{+}}{dV}\frac{d^{-}}{dW}$ is the Krein Feller operator in the case where $W$ and $V$ are strictly increasing and right continuous (respectively left continuous), possibly with dense sets of discontinuities. In this work we provide conditions ensuring that every function in $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$, which may be highly discontinuous, admits a series expansion that generalizes the classical Taylor expansion. A central feature of our approach is that all proofs are nonstandard, since classical analytical and spectral arguments cannot be adapted to this singular setting. Using these methods we characterize the eigenvectors of $\Delta_{W,V}$ in terms of generalized trigonometric functions and obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the associated eigenvalues. We also derive a sharp upper bound for the convergence exponent of these eigenvalues, and as a consequence we prove that $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ is a nuclear space. Further consequences include results on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of compact operators and improvements in traceability. As a final application we establish existence results for generalized fractional stochastic and deterministic differential equations, as well as for parabolic stochastic partial differential equations acting on nuclear spaces.</description>

      <title>The exterior Steklov problem for Euclidean domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Steklov eigenvalue problem in an exterior Euclidean domain. First, we present several formulations of this problem and establish the equivalences between them. Next, we examine various properties of the exterior Steklov eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. One of our main findings is an Escobar-type lower bound for the first exterior Steklov eigenvalue on convex domains in dimensions three and higher. This bound is expressed in terms of the principal curvatures of the boundary and is sharp, with equality attained for a ball. Moreover, it implies the existence of a sequence of convex domains with fixed volume and the first exterior Steklov eigenvalues tending to infinity. This contrasts with the interior case, as well as with the two-dimensional exterior case, for which we show that an analogue of the Weinstock isoperimetric inequality holds.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomial of generalized Ewens random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the convergence of the characteristic polynomial for random permutation matrices sampled from the generalized Ewens distribution. Under this distribution, the measure of a given permutation depends only on its cycle structure, according to certain weights assigned to each cycle length. The proof is based on uniform control of the characteristic polynomial using results from the singularity analysis of generating functions, together with the convergence of traces to explicit random variables expressed via a Poisson family. The limit function is the exponential of a Poisson series which has already appeared in the case of uniform permutation matrices. It is the Poisson analog of the Gaussian Holomorphic Chaos, related to the limit of characteristic polynomials for other matrix models such as Circular Ensembles, i.i.d. matrices, and Gaussian elliptic matrices.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Rates of Convergence for Hermitian Unitary Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides mesoscopic rates of convergence (ROC) with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for the eigenvalue determinantal point processes (DPPs) from the three major Hermitian unitary ensembles, the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble (LUE), and the Jacobi Unitary Ensemble (JUE) to their limiting point processes. We prove ROCs for the bulk of the GUE spectrum, the hard edge of the LUE spectrum, and the soft edges of the GUE, LUE, and JUE spectrums. These results are called mesoscopic because we are able to directly compare the point counts between the converging and limit DPPs in a range of scales. We are able to achieve these results by controlling the trace class norm of the integral operators determined by the DPP kernels.</description>
