      <title>Influence of finite temperature degeneracy and superthermal ions on dust acoustic solitary structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine dust acoustic (DA) solitary structures in an unmagnetized, collisionless dusty electron positron ion (epi) plasma in which electrons and positrons are described by finite temperature Fermi Dirac statistics and ions obey a superthermal kappa distribution. A normalized fluid Poisson model is formulated using polylogarithm based expressions for the partially degenerate electrons positrons, while cold negatively charged dust grains provide the inertial response. Linear dispersion analysis yields a modified DA phase speed. Nonlinear solitary structures are investigated using the Sagdeev pseudopotential method. The system is found to support only negative potential (rarefactive) DA solitary waves within a bounded subsonic Mach number interval. The critical Mach number, consequently, the corresponding linear DA speed show an explicit dependence on the degeneracy parameters and the ion spectral index. The amplitude and width of the solitary structures are shown to be highly sensitive to the electron (positron) degeneracy strength, the ion positron concentration ratios, the ion temperature ratio, and the superthermality of the ions. A small amplitude approximation of the pseudopotential reduces the system to the Korteweg de Vries limit, providing closed form expressions for the soliton characteristics, in agreement with the Sagdeev predictions. The results clarify the combined roles of finite temperature degeneracy and superthermal ions in shaping nonlinear DA dynamics in space and astrophysical dusty plasmas.</description>

      <title>Long-Pulse Fast Ignition in MagLIF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast ignition paradigm for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) allows for extremely high gains but requires fuel to be heated very quickly to outpace hotspot disassembly and energy losses. This demands lasers with high power and intensity, posing engineering challenges that have called into question the fundamental practicality of fast ignition. Magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) circumvents these problems through its large-aspect-ratio cylindrical geometry and strong axial magnetic fields that allow for ignition at lower areal densities. Furthermore, MagLIF's large aspect ratio and higher yields relax other constraints on energy deposition and repetition rate while its axial magnetic fields can be used to collimate ignitor electrons and thereby increase allowed standoff distance and save on ignitor energy. This tremendous overall relaxation of the engineering constraints that have historically limited the practicality of fast ignition suggests that the paradigm may be considerably more viable in a MagLIF context.</description>

      <title>Resonant Excitation of Surface Plasmon for Wakefield Acceleration by Beating GW Lasers on Smooth Cylindrical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and numerical study of resonant surface-plasmon (SP) excitation driven by the beating of two co-propagating laser pulses on a smooth cylindrical plasma-vacuum interface. Analytical expressions for the SP dispersion relation, field amplitude, geometric coupling factor, and resonance conditions are derived and validated by fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We reveal that curvature-induced geometric effects can substantially modify the SP dispersion and enable resonant matching by laser beat waves. This is inaccessible in planar geometries or with a single laser. Under matched resonance conditions, a high-amplitude SP-based wakefield can be generated by a few gigawatt lasers, placing this mechanism within reach of state-of-the-art fibre lasers. It therefore opens a route toward portable laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.</description>

      <title>Quantitative 3D non-linear simulations of shattered pellet injection in ASDEX Upgrade using JOREK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shattered pellet injection (SPI) as primary mitigation method for major disruptions in ITER has a large parameter space available for optimization including the total amount of injected material, the size of the individual pellet fragments, the material composition, and the timing of multiple injections. This flexibility needs to be exploited to simultaneously minimize thermal heat loads, electromagnetic vessel forces, and formation of relativistic electrons and their impacts on plasma facing components. In this article, we apply 3D non-linear magnetohydrodynamic modelling to SPI experiments in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, going beyond our previous work [Tang et al Nucl. Fusion 65 116003 (2025)] by resolving some discrepancies between simulations and experiment and thus opening the path to quantitative model validation and experiment interpretation. The key element that enables the transition from merely qualitative comparisons to quantitatively reliable predictions of the thermal quench duration and the radiation fraction is the incorporation of a simplified treatment of parallel heat-flux limiting. The work increases the confidence of matching the key processes of disruption mitigation with this high fidelity modelling in view of predictive studies for ITER.</description>

      <title>Role of the radial electric field in the confinement of energetic ions in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Good fast-ion confinement is an essential requirement for a fusion reactor. The magnetic configuration of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator is partially optimized in this regard in a reactor-relevant scenario: it is expected to show improved fast-ion confinement when $\beta$ is high and the effect of the radial electric field is negligible. The experimental validation of this optimization is difficult since, with the available power, achieving high $\beta$ under appropriate conditions for the validation is challenging and the effect of the radial electric field is inevitable. In this work, the confinement of fast ions in W7-X has been studied numerically for a variety of scenarios via the ASCOT5 code. The effect of the radial electric field on fast-ion losses is confirmed to be equivalent to the one produced by $\beta$, and this is characterized by means of scans on both parameters. Through a preliminary study with experimentally-based profiles, a viable scenario is identified that takes advantage of this effect for the experimental validation of the optimization strategy of W7-X.</description>

      <title>Structure preservation using discrete gradients in the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel structure-preserving framework for solving the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system of equations using a particle in cell (PIC) discretization combined with discrete gradient time integrators. The Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system is an accurate model for studying hot plasma dynamics at a kinetic scale where small-angle Coulomb collisions dominate. Our scheme guarantees conservation of mass, momentum and energy as well as preservation of the monotonicity of entropy production in both the time-continuous and discrete systems. We employ the conservative integrator for both the Hamiltonian Vlasov-Poisson equations and the dissipative Landau equation using the PETSc library (www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) to showcase structure-preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Exact moment models for conservation laws in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moment equations offer a compelling alternative to the kinetic description of plasmas, gases, and liquids. Their simulation requires fewer degrees of freedom than phase space models, yet it can still incorporate kinetic effects to a certain extent. To derive moment equations, we use a parameterization of the distribution function using centered moments, as proposed by Burby. This yields moment equations for which the parameterized distribution function exactly solves the hyperbolic conservation law. Similarly, a particle model is derived based on a parametrization of the distribution function using phase space moments. Finally, we present the application of the method to the non-relativistic and relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Surfing Acceleration as a Coherent Mechanism for Electron Acceleration in Galaxy Cluster Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio relics in merging galaxy clusters are widely interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated at large-scale shocks. However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $\gamma \sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions. These results suggest that radio relics provide a promising astrophysical laboratory for probing coherent acceleration, and that the BSA framework may account for the production of relativistic electrons in cluster shocks.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Compression for Fully Spectral Vlasov-Poisson Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for kinetic plasma simulation in which the phase-space distribution function is represented by a low-rank tensor network with an adaptive level of compression. The Vlasov-Poisson system is advanced using Strang splitting, and each substep is treated spectrally in the corresponding variable. By expressing both the distribution function and the Fourier transform as tensor network objects (state and operator representations), spectral transforms are applied directly in compressed form, enabling time stepping without reconstructing the full phase-space grid. The self-consistent electric field is also computed within the tensor formalism. The charge density is obtained by contracting over velocity degrees of freedom and extracting the zero Fourier mode, which provides the source term for a spectral Poisson solver. We validate the approach on standard benchmarks, including Landau damping and the two-stream instability. Finally, we systematically study how compression parameters, including truncation tolerances and internal ranks (bond dimensions), affect momentum and energy conservation, positivity behavior, robustness to filamentation, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for warm dense matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This roadmap presents the state-of-the-art, current challenges and near future developments anticipated in the thriving field of warm dense matter physics. Originating from strongly coupled plasma physics, high pressure physics and high energy density science, the warm dense matter physics community has recently taken a giant leap forward. This is due to spectacular developments in laser technology, diagnostic capabilities, and computer simulation techniques. Only in the last decade has it become possible to perform accurate enough simulations \&amp; experiments to truly verify theoretical results as well as to reliably design experiments based on predictions. Consequently, this roadmap discusses recent developments and contemporary challenges that are faced by theoretical methods, and experimental techniques needed to create and diagnose warm dense matter. A large part of this roadmap is dedicated to specific warm dense matter systems and applications in astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion and novel material synthesis.</description>

      <title>Variability of MHD Instabilities in Benign Termination of High-Current Runaway Electron Beams in the JET and DIII-D Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benign termination, in which magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities deconfine runaway electrons (REs) following hydrogenic injections, is a promising strategy for mitigating dangerous RE loads after disruptions. Recent experiments on the Joint European Torus (JET) have explored this scenario at higher pre-disruptive plasma currents than are achievable on other devices, revealing challenges in obtaining benign terminations at $I_p \geq 2.5$ MA. This work analyzes the evolution of these high-current RE beams and their terminating MHD events using fast magnetic sensor measurements and EFIT equilibrium reconstructions for approximately $40$ JET and $20$ DIII-D tokamak discharges. On JET, unsuccessful non-benign terminations occur at low edge safety factor ($q_{\text{edge}} \approx 2$), and are preceded by intermittent, non-terminating MHD events at higher rational $q_{\text{edge}}$. Trends in the internal inductance $l_i$ indicate more peaked RE current profiles in the high-$I_p$ non-benign population, which may hinder successful recombination through re-ionization. In contrast, benign terminations on JET typically occur at higher $q_{\text{edge}} \geq 3$ and exhibit less peaked RE current profiles. DIII-D displays a range of terminating edge safety factors, correlated with the measured $l_i$ values. Across both tokamaks, the RE current peaking is therefore found to determine which MHD instability boundary is encountered, confirmed by linear resistive MHD modeling with the CASTOR3D code. Measured growth rates are similar for benign and non-benign cases, indicating that ideal MHD timescales at low density after hydrogenic injection do not alone explain efficient RE deconfinement. Instead, non-benign cases are characterized by their lower MHD perturbation amplitudes $\delta B$. These observations suggest that the interplay between ideal and resistive dynamics governs the termination process.</description>

      <title>Tuning Optical Properties of FTO via Carbonaceous Al2O3 Microdot Deposition by DC plasma sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is a key transparent conductive oxide for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet its high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency. This work demonstrates a simple DC plasma sputtering approach to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres. For plasma discharge in the normal mode, with plasma density 10^9 cm^-3 and temperature of 2 eV, Volmer-Weber growth produced discrete microdots whose size and distribution were tuned by gas composition: dense, uniform dots in Ar (approximately 0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, and intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres. Structural analysis confirmed Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation, while SEM revealed morphology-driven optical behavior. UV-Vis measurements showed that Ar-O2 coatings achieved the lowest reflectance across the visible range, outperforming bare FTO and other conditions. These findings establish a clear link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering a scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.</description>
