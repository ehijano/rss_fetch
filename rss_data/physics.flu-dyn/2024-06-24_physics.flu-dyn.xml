      <title>Recovering particle velocity and size distributions in ejecta with Photon Doppler Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a solid metal is struck, its free surface can eject fast and fine particles. Despite the many diagnostics that have been implemented to measure the mass, size, velocity or temperature of ejecta, these efforts provide only a partial picture of this phenomenon. Ejecta characterization, especially in constrained geometries, is an inherently ill-posed problem. In this context, Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) has been a valuable diagnostic, measuring reliably particles and free surface velocities in the single scattering regime. Here we present ejecta experiments in gas and how, in this context, PDV allows one to retrieve additional information on the ejecta, i.e. information on the particles' size. We explain what governs ejecta transport in gas and how it can be simulated. To account for the multiple scattering of light in these ejecta, we use the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) that quantitatively describes PDV spectrograms, and their dependence on the velocity but also on the size distribution of the ejecta. We remind how spectrograms can be simulated by solving numerically this RTE and we show how to do so on hydrodynamic ejecta simulation results. Finally, we use this complex machinery in different ejecta transport scenarios to simulate the corresponding spectrograms. Comparing these to experimental results, we iteratively constrain the ejecta description at an unprecedented level. This work demonstrates our ability to recover particle size information from what is initially a velocity diagnostic, but more importantly it shows how, using existing simulation of ejecta, we capture through simulation the complexity of experimental spectrograms.</description>

      <title>A granular scaling approach to landslide runout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A main objective in landslide research is to predict how far they will travel. Landslides are complex, and a complete understanding in principle requires accounting for numerous parameters. Here we engender a simplification by investigating the maximum landslide runout using granular laboratory experiments and a scaling analysis. We find that correctly accounting for the fall height and grain size distribution not only yields an improved correlation of normalized runout, but also quantitatively unites laboratory and field data. In particular, we find that the mobility of landslides increases with the square root of the fall height and with the skewness of the grain size distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory granular landslides are smaller-scale, simplified, yet well-controlled versions of larger and often tragic natural landslides. Using systematic experiments and scaling analysis, we quantify the influence of grain size, fall height, and landslide volume on runout distance. We also determine the minimum landslide size required to observe this scaling, which we find is set by a combination of air drag, grain size, and fall height.</description>

      <title>Steady axisymmetric vortices in radial stagnation flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of axisymmetric vortex solutions superposed upon radial stagnation flows is described. The new vortex solutions generalize the classical Burgers' vortex and Sullivan's vortex solutions in the presence of a volumetric line source at the symmetry axis, the former approaching the Burgers' vortex sheet when the source strength becomes very large. The stability of the generalized Burgers' vortex is studied. In a different manner from the classical solution, the generalized Burgers' vortices are found to be unstable for two-dimensional disturbances when the vortex Reynolds number is increased above a critical value, for a fixed strength of the volumetric source.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of solute in straining flows and boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute dispersion due to an instantaneously released source in steady, laminar, axisymmetric flows with an axial inflow and radial outflow is investigated analytically. Attention is given to large-time characteristics of dispersion, where the concentration reduces in proportion to $e^{-2\lambda \tau}$, where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue that depends on the axial inflow and $\tau$ is the time measured in units of axial-diffusion times. Prospects of some other flows are also considered.</description>

      <title>A note on viscous flow induced by half-line sources bounded by conical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper axisymmetric solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations governing the flow induced by a half-line source when the fluid domain is bounded by a conical wall are discussed. Two types of boundary conditions are identified; one in which the radial velocity along the axis is prescribed, and the other in which the radial velocity along the axis is obtained as an eigenvalue of the problem. The existence of these solutions are limited to a range of Reynolds numbers and the transition from one case to the other are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>A thick reaction zone model for premixed flames in two-dimensional channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct interactions between the flow field and the chemical reaction in premixed flames occur when the reaction zone thickness is comparable to, or greater than flow length scales. To study such interactions, a laminar model is considered that has direct bearings to steadily propagating deflagrations in a Hele-Shaw channel with a background plane Poiseuille flow. The study employs asymptotic analyses, pertaining to large activation energy and lubrication theories and considers a distinguished limit where the channel width is comparable to the reaction zone thickness, with account being taken of thermal-expansion and heat-loss effects. The reaction zone structure and burning rates depend on three parameters, namely, the Peclet number, $\mathcal{P}$, the Lewis number, $Le$ and the ratio of channel half-width to reaction zone thickness, $\lambda_*$. When the parameter $\lambda_*$ is small, transport processes are controlled by Taylor's dispersion mechanism and an explicit formula for the effective burning speed $S_T$ is obtained. The formula indicates that $S_T/S_L \propto 1/Le$ for $\mathcal{P}\gg 1$, which interestingly coincides with a recent experimental prediction of the flame speed in a highly turbulent jet flame. The results suggest that the role played by differential diffusion effects is significant both in laminar and turbulent cases. The reason for the peculiar $1/Le$ dependence can be attributed, in our laminar model, to Taylor dispersion. Presumably, this dependence may be attributed to a similar but more general mechanism in the turbulent case, rather than to diffusive-thermal curvature effects. The latter effects play however an important role in determining the flame speed when $\lambda_*$ is large. The magnitude of heat losses at extinction, is multiplied by a factor $1/Le^2$ in comparison with those corresponding to the no-flow case in narrow channels.</description>

      <title>Drag reduction in surfactant-contaminated superhydrophobic channels at high P\'eclet numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by microfluidic applications, we investigate drag reduction in laminar pressure-driven flows in channels with streamwise-periodic superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) that are contaminated with soluble surfactant. We develop a model in the long-wave and weak-diffusion limit, where the streamwise SHS period is large compared to the channel height and the P\'eclet number is large. Employing asymptotic and numerical techniques, we determine the drag due to surfactant in terms of the relative strength of diffusion, Marangoni effects and bulk-surface exchange. In scenarios with strong bulk-surface exchange, the drag reduction exhibits a complex dependence on the thickness of the bulk-concentration boundary layer and surfactant strength. Strong Marangoni effects immobilise the interface through a linear surfactant distribution, whereas weak Marangoni effects yield a quasi-stagnant cap with an intricate asymptotic structure that is mediated by weak bulk diffusion. As bulk-surface exchange weakens, the bulk and interface decouple: the surfactant distribution is linear when the surfactant is strong and forms a classical stagnant cap when the surfactant is weak. The asymptotic solutions offer closed-form predictions of drag reduction across much of parameter space, providing practical utility and enhancing understanding of surfactant dynamics in flows over SHSs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Global Simulation of Nonlocal Gravity Wave Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global climate models typically operate at a grid resolution of hundreds of kilometers and fail to resolve atmospheric mesoscale processes, e.g., clouds, precipitation, and gravity waves (GWs). Model representation of these processes and their sources is essential to the global circulation and planetary energy budget, but subgrid scale contributions from these processes are often only approximately represented in models using parameterizations. These parameterizations are subject to approximations and idealizations, which limit their capability and accuracy. The most drastic of these approximations is the "single-column approximation" which completely neglects the horizontal evolution of these processes, resulting in key biases in current climate models. With a focus on atmospheric GWs, we present the first-ever global simulation of atmospheric GW fluxes using machine learning (ML) models trained on the WINDSET dataset to emulate global GW emulation in the atmosphere, as an alternative to traditional single-column parameterizations. Using an Attention U-Net-based architecture trained on globally resolved GW momentum fluxes, we illustrate the importance and effectiveness of global nonlocality, when simulating GWs using data-driven schemes.</description>

      <title>ASTERIX: Module for modelling the water flow on vegetated hillslopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents ASTERIX, an open source software for numerical integration of an extended Saint-Venant system of equations used as a mathematical tool to model the water flow from laboratory up to large-scale spatial domains applying physically-based principles of fluid mechanics. Many in-situ observations have shown that the plant cover plays a key roll in controlling the hydrological flux at a catchment scale. The plant roots facilitate the infiltration processes, the canopy intercept some proportion of rain, and plant stems slow down the flow. In case of heavy rains, the infiltration and interception processes cease in a short time, the remaining rainfall gives rise to the Hortonian overland flow and the flash flood is thus initiated. In this context, the following problem is also addressed in the article: how do the gradient of soil surface and the density of the plant cover influence the water dynamics in the Hortonian flow? The mathematical model and ASTERIX were kept as simple as possible in order to be accessible to a wide range of stakeholders interested in understanding the complex processes behind the water flow on hillslopes covered by plants.
  The software is written in C programming language and it is free under GNU license. It was tested on a series of benchmark problems, laboratory experiments, and theoretical problems; and the results have shown a good agreement with the theoretical or measured data.</description>

      <title>How do longitudinal waves propagate transversely?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern, high-fidelity numerical simulations have shown an apparently anomalous result: a longitudinal elastodynamic wave travelling perpendicular to the forcing direction. Numerical simulations, in combination with an analytical model, are used to confirm that this is not simply a simulation artefact, but a true physical phenomenon, as well as illustrating that the behaviour also occurs for shear and guided waves. When assessing how this unexpected wave interacts with objects, however, it is found that it does not scatter, despite being clearly measurable. This paper has uncovered and explained this behaviour, which is critical for the reliable use of numerical wave simulations in elastic media, as well as potentially for high sensitivity experiments and other polarised wave modalities.</description>

Abstract: Viscoelastic fluids are a class of fluids that exhibit both viscous and elastic nature. Modelling such fluids requires constitutive equations for the stress, and choosing the most appropriate constitutive relationship can be difficult. We present viscoelasticNet, a physics-informed deep learning framework that uses the velocity flow field to select the constitutive model and learn the stress field. Our framework requires data only for the velocity field, initial \&amp; boundary conditions for the stress tensor, and the boundary condition for the pressure field. Using this information, we learn the model parameters, the pressure field, and the stress tensor. {This work considers} three commonly used non-linear viscoelastic models: Oldroyd-B, Giesekus, and linear Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT). We demonstrate that our framework works well with noisy and sparse data. Our framework can be combined with velocity fields acquired from experimental techniques like particle image velocimetry to get the pressure \&amp; stress fields and model parameters for the constitutive equation. Once the model has been discovered using viscoelasticNet, the fluid can be simulated and modeled for further applications.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Urban Boundary-Layer Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17807v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling is a viable solution for applications involving repetitive evaluations of expensive computational fluid dynamics models, such as uncertainty quantification and inverse problems. This study proposes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based machine-learning surrogate for canopy flow statistics accommodating any approaching mean-wind angle. The training and testing of the surrogate model is based on results from large-eddy simulations of open-channel flow over and within surface-mounted cubes under neutral ambient stratification. The training dataset comprises flow statistics from various approaching mean-wind angles, and the surrogate is asked to "connect between the dots," i.e., to predict flow statistics for unseen values of the approaching mean-wind angle. The MLP performance is compared against a more traditional spline-based interpolation approach for a range of training data. In terms of relative mean absolute errors on individual flow statistics, the proposed MLP surrogate consistently outperforms the spline interpolation, especially when the number of training samples is reduced. The MLP model accurately captures mean profiles and three-dimensional flow variability, offering robust predictions, even when trained with as few as four approaching wind angles. The model is $10^4 \times$ faster than large-eddy simulations, thus proving effective for multi-query tasks in the context of urban canopy flow modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic effects of low- and high-frequency synthetic jet control strategies on a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 0025 airfoil. Visualizations and measurements are employed to assess the stability of the flow, focusing on the shear layer and wake dynamics under two forcing frequencies. High-frequency actuation is found to induce steadier flow reattachment and more favorable aerodynamic characteristics compared to low-frequency control. Flow structures resulting from high-frequency actuation, notably vortex rings, are identified and their significance in flow control is evaluated. Furthermore, the spanwise control authority is analyzed, revealing variations in aerodynamic stability away from the midspan. Insights from modal analysis provide additional understanding of flow structures and their evolution across different spanwise planes.</description>

Abstract: We present a formalism to describe the motion of a fluid that is fully covariant with respect to arbitrary observers. To achieve full covariance, we write prognostic equations for quantities that belong to the graded exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle of the manifold occupied by the fluid. With the new formalism, we consider problems of stability, and we derive a generalization of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation that describes the evolution of perturbations relative to an arbitrary observer. The latter is applied to cases where the observer is the Lagrangian observer comoving with the background flow.</description>
