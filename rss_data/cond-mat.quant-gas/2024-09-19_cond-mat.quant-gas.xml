      <title>Monte Carlo Methods in the Manifold of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Wave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to implement random walks in the manifold of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov wave functions. The goal is to extend state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo approaches, in particular the constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo technique, to systems where finite pairing order parameters or complex pairing mechanisms, e.g., Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing or triplet pairing, may be expected. Leveraging the flexibility to define a vacuum state tailored to the physical problem, we discuss a method to use imaginary-time evolution of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states to compute ground state correlations, extending beyond situations spanned by current formalisms. Illustrative examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of Gaussian unitary transformations for bosonic and fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian unitary transformations are generated by quadratic Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians containing quadratic terms in creations and annihilation operators, and are heavily used in many areas of quantum physics, ranging from quantum optics and condensed matter theory to quantum information and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. They are known to form a representation of the metaplectic and spin group for bosons and fermions, respectively. These groups are the double covers of the symplectic and special orthogonal group, respectively, and our goal is to analyze the behavior of the sign ambiguity that one needs to deal with when moving between these groups and their double cover. We relate this sign ambiguity to expectation values of the form $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$, where $|0\rangle$ is a Gaussian state and $\hat{H}$ an arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian. We provide closed formulas for $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$ and show how we can efficiently describe group multiplications in the double cover without the need of going to a faithful representation on an exponentially large or even infinite-dimensional space. Our construction relies on an explicit parametrization of these two groups (metaplectic, spin) in terms of symplectic and orthogonal group elements together with a twisted U(1) group.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors and fermionic superfluids. We identify cases where the long-time SH response is determined by a pole in the averaged SH susceptibility, located on the unphysical sheet of its Riemann surface. Using analytic continuation across the two-particle branch cut, we obtain the zero-temperature dispersion relation and damping rate of the SH mode linked to this pole. When the coherence length significantly exceeds the mean free path, the pole is ``hidden'' behind the two-particle continuum edge at $2\Delta$, leading to SH oscillations at late times decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$. Nevertheless, the pole induces a peak in the retarded SH susceptibility at a frequency above $2\Delta$ and causes sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z=4$ at both late times and long distances. Conversely, long-distance oscillations at a fixed frequency $\omega$ occur only for $\omega$ exceeding $2\Delta$, with a spatial period diverging at the threshold as $1/(\omega - 2\Delta)^{1/4}$, up to logarithmic factors. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, the pole can reemerge into the continuum, resulting in additional late-time oscillations at fixed wave vectors with frequencies above $2\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of dipolar Bose polarons in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticle properties of a dipolar impurity immersed in a two-dimensional dipolar bath. We use the ab-initio Diffusion Monte Carlo technique to determine the polaron energy, effective mass and quasiparticle residue. We find that both the polaron energy and quasiparticle residue follow a universal behaviour with respect to the polarization angle when properly scaled in terms of the scattering length. This trend is maintained over a wide range of values of the gas parameter, even in the highly correlated regime. Instead, the effective mass shows growing anisotropy as the tilting angle is increased, which is induced, mainly, by the anisotropy of the impurity-boson dipole-dipole interaction. Surprisingly, the effective mass is larger in the direction of minimum inter-particle repulsion. Finally, we use our Monte Carlo results to check the accuracy of perturbative approaches and determine their range of validity in terms of the gas parameter.</description>

      <title>The Jaynes-Cummings model and its descendants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00330v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model has been at the forefront of quantum optics for almost six decades to date, providing one of the simplest yet intricately nonlinear formulations of light-matter interaction in modern physics. Laying most of the emphasis on the omnipresence of the model across a range of disciplines, this monograph brings up the fundamental generality of its formalism, looking at a wide gamut of applications in specific physical systems among several realms, including atomic physics, quantum optics, solid-state physics and quantum information science. When bringing the various pieces together to assemble our narrative, we have primarily targeted researchers in quantum physics and quantum optics. The monograph also comprises an accessible introduction for graduate students engaged with non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, quantum computing and simulation, and quantum many-body physics. In that framework, we aim to reveal the common ground between physics and applications scattered across literature and different technological advancements. The exposition guides the reader through a vibrant field interlacing quantum optics and condensed-matter physics. All sections are devoted to the strong interconnection between theory and experiment, historically linked to the development of the various modern research directions stemming from JC physics. This is accompanied by a comprehensive list of references to the key publications that have shaped its evolution since the early 1960s. Finally, we have endeavored to keep the presentation of such a multi-sided material as concise as possible, interspersing continuous text with various illustrations alongside an economical use of mathematical expressions.</description>

      <title>Optimal light cone for macroscopic particle transport in long-range systems: A quantum speed limit approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ultimate rate at which information propagates is a pivotal issue in nonequilibrium physics. Nevertheless, the task of elucidating the propagation speed inherent in quantum bosonic systems presents challenges due to the unbounded nature of their interactions. In this study, we tackle the problem of macroscopic particle transport in a long-range generalization of the lattice Bose-Hubbard model through the lens of the quantum speed limit. By developing a unified approach based on optimal transport theory, we rigorously prove that the minimum time required for macroscopic particle transport is always bounded by the distance between the source and target regions, while retaining its significance even in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the probability of observing a specific number of bosons inside the target region, thereby providing additional insights into the dynamics of particle transport. Our results hold true for arbitrary initial states under both long-range hopping and long-range interactions, thus resolving an open problem of particle transport in generic bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations of Spectrum Form Factor and Krylov Complexity at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of quantum chaos diagnostics, considerable attention has been attributed to the Krylov complexity and spectrum form factor (SFF) for systems at infinite temperature. These investigations have unveiled universal properties of quantum chaotic systems. By extending the analysis to include the finite temperature effects on the Krylov complexity and SFF, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, which are associated with the Wightman inner product, display consistency with the universal hypothesis presented in PRX 9, 041017 (2019). This result contrasts with the behavior of Lanczos coefficients associated with the standard inner product. Our results indicate that the slope $\alpha$ of the $b_n$ is bounded by $\pi k_BT$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature. We also investigate the SFF, which characterizes the two-point correlation of the spectrum and encapsulates an indicator of ergodicity denoted by $g$ in chaotic systems. Our analysis demonstrates that as the temperature decreases, the value of $g$ decreases as well. Considering that $\alpha$ also represents the operator growth rate, we establish a quantitative relationship between ergodicity indicator and Lanczos coefficients slope. To support our findings, we provide evidence using the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and a random spin model. Our work deepens the understanding of the finite temperature effects on Krylov complexity, SFF, and the connection between ergodicity and operator growth.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole coupling of circular Rydberg qubits to inner shell excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divalent atoms provide excellent means for advancing control in Rydberg atom-based quantum simulation and computing, due to the second optically active valence electron available. Particularly promising in this context are circular Rydberg atoms, for which long-lived ionic core excitations can be exploited without suffering from detrimental autoionization. Here, we report the implementation of electric quadrupole coupling between the metastable 4D$_{3/2}$ level and a very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular Rydberg qubit, realized in doubly excited $^{88}$Sr atoms prepared from an optical tweezer array. We measure the kHz-scale differential level shift on the circular Rydberg qubit via beat-node Ramsey interferometry comprising spin echo. Observing this coupling requires coherent interrogation of the Rydberg states for more than one hundred microseconds, which is assisted by tweezer trapping and circular state lifetime enhancement in a black-body radiation suppressing capacitor. Further, we find no noticeable loss of qubit coherence under continuous photon scattering on the ion core, paving the way for laser cooling and imaging of Rydberg atoms. Our results demonstrate access to weak electron-electron interactions in Rydberg atoms and expand the quantum simulation toolbox for optical control of highly excited circular state qubits via ionic core manipulation.</description>
