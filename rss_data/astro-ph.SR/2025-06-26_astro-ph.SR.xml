      <title>James Webb Space Telescope observations of the white dwarf cooling sequence of 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc or NGC 104) using deep infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). By combining these data with ultra-deep optical imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) taken ~12 years earlier, we derived precise proper motions (PMs) and isolated a clean sample of WD cluster members. We estimated the cluster's age by comparing the observed WD cooling sequence luminosity function (LF), derived from JWST photometry, with theoretical models, obtaining a value of 11.8 +/- 0.5 Gyr, in agreement with main sequence turn-off ages, and ages determined from the masses and radii of two eclipsing binaries in the cluster. The age determined from the infrared LF is consistent with the optical LF based on the HST photometry. However, small discrepancies exist between the shape of the observed and theoretical LFs. To investigate these differences, we tested the cooling times of WD models populating the bright part of the observed cooling sequence against a semi-empirical calibration from the literature, based on bright WDs in 47 Tuc, finding agreement within less than 2 sigma. A more detailed analysis of dynamical effects and the impact of multiple stellar populations on the WD mass distribution in the observed field will be essential for addressing this discrepancy in future studies.</description>

      <title>The Ultimate I-band Calibration of the TRGB Standard Candle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ultimate I-band calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) standard candle. Our calibration is based on photometry from the outer parts of the Large Magellanic Cloud, 2.75&lt;r&lt;6.5 degs from the center, collected during the OGLE-IV phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Outer regions of the LMC have large advantages compared to the previous attempts of the TRGB calibrations using the red giants from the central parts of this galaxy. The interstellar reddening in these regions is much lower and more uniform, stellar crowding is lower and the outer parts of the LMC can be accurately described as a flat disk within the reasonable distance from the LMC center. The number of red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch in our LMC region is large, ~140 000, making it possible to determine of the tip magnitude with high accuracy.
  Our ultimate I-band calibration of the TRGB is: M_{I,TRGB}=-4.022 +- 0.006 (stat.) +- 0.033 (syst.) mag. We also provide its values for different techniques of the determination of the tip magnitude. The accuracy of our calibration is mostly limited by the accuracy of the distance to the LMC (~1%) and can be improved in the future.
  We test our calibration by comparing it with the TRGB in the Small Magellanic Cloud and NGC 4258, i.e., the galaxies with precise geometric distance determination, and find excellent agreement. Finally, we refine the main determinations of the Hubble constant, H_0, with the TRGB using our new calibration of the I-band TRGB brightness.</description>

      <title>Inferring the efficiency of convective-envelope overshooting in Red Giant Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of mixing processes in stars is crucial for improving our knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar photospheres and of their variation with evolutionary phase. This is fundamental for many astrophysical issues on all scales, ranging from stellar evolution to the chemical composition, formation and evolution of stellar clusters and galaxies. Among these processes, convective-envelope overshooting is in dire need of a systematic calibration and comparison with predictions from multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. The Red Giant Branch bump (RGBb) is an ideal calibrator of overshooting processes, since its luminosity depends on the maximum depth reached by the convective envelope after the first dredge-up. Indeed, a more efficient overshooting produces a discontinuity in the Hydrogen mass fraction profile deeper in the stellar interior and consequently a less luminous RGBb. In this work, we calibrated the overshooting efficiency by comparing the RGBb location predicted by stellar models with observations of stellar clusters with HST and Gaia photometry, as well as solar-like oscillating giants in the Kepler field. We explored the metallicity range between -2.02 dex and +0.35 dex and found overshooting efficiencies ranging from $0.009^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$ to $0.062^{+0.017}_{-0.015}$. In particular, we found that the overshooting efficiency decreases linearly with [M/H], with a slope of $(-0.010\pm0.006)$ dex$^{-1}$. We suggest a possible explanation for this trend, linking it to the efficiency of turbulent entrainment at different metallicities.</description>

      <title>Physics Of Eclipsing Binaries. VII. Interferometric module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric measurements are essential to constrain models of stellar systems, by spatially resolving angular distances and diameters well below the classical diffraction limit. In this work, we describe the interferometric module of Phoebe, which could be used just for this purpose. Since binaries in Phoebe are represented by a triangular mesh, our complex model is based on the integration over triangles. Consequently, Roche distortion, rotation, non-synchronicity, misalignment, eclipses of components, darkening, reflection, or irradiation are all accurately accounted for. For comparison purposes, we provide a simplified model, where components are represented by circular disks. The key point of our approach is a possibility of combination with other datasets (light curves, radial velocities), which allows to construct robust models of stellar systems.

      <description>arXiv:2506.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple stellar systems are common especially among O and B stars. In order to accurately describe their dynamics, interactions among components must be accounted for. In this work, we describe the new dynamical model in Phoebe, which could be used just for this purpose. The n-body model is based on the Reboundx numerical integrator and accounts for mutual perturbations, oblateness, relativistic effects, or light-time effects. The initial conditions can be set up as hierarchical or two-pairs geometry. For comparison purposes, we also provide a simplified keplerian model. Photometric computations work similarly as before, with Roche distortions for pairs of components (or for centres of mass, if hierarchical), and all mutual eclipses. If the time span of observations is long enough, so that perturbations (precession, resonances) are manifested in eclipse timings or durations, this allows to construct order-of-magnitude more precise models of stellar systems.

      <title>Physics Of Eclipsing Binaries. IX. Spectroscopic module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations constrain the fundamental properties of stellar atmospheres, in particular, the effective temperature, the gravitational acceleration, or the metallicity. In this work, we describe the spectroscopic module for Phoebe, which allows for modelling of spectra, either normalized, or in absolute units (${\rm W}\,{\rm m}^{-2}\,{\rm m}^{-1}$). The module is based on extensive grids of synthetic spectra, taken from literature, which are interpolated and integrated over the surface. As an approximation, we assume that limb darkening is given by an analytical law, while other effects (e.g., eclipses) are treated self-consistently. Our approach is suitable for single stars, binaries, or multiples, and can be further extended to systems with pulsating components.

      <title>Stellar Dynamics in Open Clusters Increases the Binary Fraction and Mass Ratios: Evidence from Photometric Binaries in 35 Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution-9 (BASE-9) code and Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS data, we identify photometric binaries in 35 open clusters (OCs) and constrain their masses. We find a strong correlation between the binary fraction and cluster dynamical age and an even stronger correlation between core binary fraction and cluster dynamical age. We find the binary mass-ratio (q) distribution of dynamically young OCs is statistically distinct from that of the old OCs. On average, dynamically young OCs display multi-modal q distributions rising toward unity and toward our detection limit of q=0.5 while more dynamically evolved clusters display more uniform q distributions often with a peak near q=1. Interestingly, the uniform q distribution with a peak near q=1 is consistent with binaries in the field. We also observe a similar transition from multi-modal to unimodal q distributions when comparing low mass to high mass OCs in our sample. Lastly, we find a correlation between the median q of the binary population in a cluster and the cluster dynamical age. We interpret these results as an indication that dynamical encounters tend to increase the fraction of high-mass-ratio binaries within a given cluster -- particularly within the cluster's core where stellar dynamics are likely more important. This may be the result of stellar exchanges that tend to produce binaries with larger q and/or the preferential disruption or evaporation of lower q binaries.</description>

      <title>KMT-2022-BLG-0086: Another binary-lens binary-source microlensing event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of a microlensing event KMT-2022-BLG-0086 of which the overall light curve is not described by a binary-lens single-source (2L1S) model, which suggests the existence of an extra lens or an extra source. We found that the event is best explained by the binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model, but the 2L2S model is only favored over the triple-lens single-source (3L1S) model by $\Delta\chi^{2} \simeq 9$. Although the event has noticeable anomalies around the peak of the light curve, they are not enough covered to constrain the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, thus we only measure the minimum angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E,min}$. From the Bayesian analysis, it is found that that the binary lens system is a binary star with masses of $(m_1,m_2)=(0.46^{+0.35}_{-0.25}\, M_\odot, 0.75^{+0.67}_{-0.55}\, M_\odot)$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=5.87^{+1.21}_{-1.79}$ kpc, while the triple lens system is a brown dwarf or a massive giant planet in a low-mass binary-star system with masses of $(m_1,m_2,m_3)=(0.43^{+0.41}_{-0.35}\, M_\odot, 0.056^{+0.055}_{-0.047}\, M_\odot, 20.84^{+20.20}_{-17.04}\, M_{\rm J})$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=4.06^{+1.39}_{-3.28}$ kpc, indicating a disk lens system. The 2L2S model yields the relative lens-source proper motion of $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 4.6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ that is consistent with the Bayesian result, whereas the 3L1S model yields $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 18.9\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$, which is more than three times larger than that of a typical disk object of $\sim 6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ and thus is not consistent with the Bayesian result. This suggests that the event is likely caused by the binary-lens binary-source model.</description>

      <title>Systematic NICER study of the low-ionized Fe K$\alpha$ line on RS Canum Venaticorum type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line ($\sim 6.4$ keV) has been observed during solar and stellar flares. Two emission mechanisms of the Fe K$\alpha$ line, photoionization and collisional ionization, have been discussed, and the aim of this work is to collect evidences for each mechanism employing a statistical correlation approach between the Fe K$\alpha$ line flux and rough flare properties. Here, we systematically searched the NICER (0.2$-$12 keV) archive data for the Fe K$\alpha$ line of RS Canum Venaticorum type stars. Among our analyzed 255 observation IDs with a total exposure of $\sim 700$ ks, we found 25 data sets (total $\sim 40$ ks) exhibiting the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.37$-$6.54 keV with its equivalent width of 44.3$-$578.4 eV: 18 observations during flares, 6 observations during unconfirmed possible flare candidates and one at a quiescent phase. These observations indicate a positive correlation between the Fe K$\alpha$ line intensity and the 7.11$-$20 keV thermal plasma luminosity with its powerlaw index of $0.86 \pm 0.46$. This correlation in the range of the thermal plasma luminosity $10^{29-33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is consistent with the photoionization origin of the line. On the other hand, the equivalent width of the Fe K$\alpha$ line has a negative correlation with the 7.11$-$20 keV thermal plasma luminosity with its powerlaw index of $-0.27 \pm 0.10$. This anti-correlation is consistent with the decline of the fluorescence efficiency with increasing the stellar flare loop height. Furthermore, we found a signature of an absorption line at $6.38^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ keV during a superflare of $\sigma$ Gem. The equivalent width of the line was $-34.7^{+2.03}_{-1.58}$ eV. We discuss the density of the Fe ions from the equivalent width using the curve of growth analysis.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from flaring stars and brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. With the aim to reveal the effects of the magnetic field to the multi-band activity of dwarf stars, we search for associated radio emission for an extensive list of 14 915 brown dwarfs and 15 124 flaring stars. Methods. We utilised the first and second epoch catalogues and radio maps from all three epochs of the VLASS, supplemented with X-ray catalogues based on observations by the ROSAT, eROSITA, and XMM-Newton space telescopes, and 2-minute cadence optical light curves from the TESS mission. The radio-detected sub-sample was queried for concurrent TESS observations, and sources with coinciding light-curves were studied individually. Results. We found no associated radio emission for brown dwarfs, and found 55 radio counterparts for the sample of flaring stars, out of which seven have coincident TESS observations. The radio-detected sample follows both the radio-X-ray and the period-activity relations. We found a strong correlation between the radio powers and the stellar parameters of surface gravity, radius, and mass. We found no connection between the flare rate and the radio variability. For radio-detected stars with available effective temperatures and rotational periods, we estimated gyrochronological ages, which resulted in values of Tgyro &lt; 1 Gyr, with the majority of the sample being younger than 150 Myr. We found no strong connection between the occurrence of optical flares and radio variability for the individually studied stars. Conclusions. We conclude that radio emission from intermediate-to-late type flaring stars is of synchrotron nature, and shares a common origin with X-ray processes. It is created by a predominantly young stellar population, and is the collective contribution of stellar flares, accretion, and coronal heating.</description>

      <title>The Relation between Solar Spicules and Magnetohydrodynamic Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spicules are thin, elongated jet-like features seen in observations of the solar atmosphere, at the interface between the solar photosphere and the corona. These features exhibit highly complex dynamics and are a necessary connecting link between the cooler, denser solar chromosphere and the extremely hot, tenuous corona. In this work, we explore the spatial and temporal relation between solar spicules and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) shocks using data from a 2D radiative MHD (rMHD) simulation of the solar atmosphere driven by solar convection. Here, we demonstrate, through direct identification, that slow MHD shocks, which propagate along magnetic field lines, are regions of strong positive vertical acceleration of the plasma that forms the tip of the spicule material during its rise phase. We quantify the effect of pressure and Lorentz forces on the acceleration of the plasma inside the shocks during the rise of spicules. The causality between spicule and shock propagation in the atmosphere of the model is also investigated. It is further shown that the strength of these shocks may play a vital role in determining the height of the spicules, supporting the idea that shocks act as drivers of some spicules. In addition, we also find the presence of structures similar to propagating coronal disturbances (PCDs) in the simulation, linked with the spicules. Here, PCDs appear to be associated with the shock waves driving the spicules that subsequently propagate into the corona and have similar speeds to those reported in observations.</description>

Abstract: Split main-sequences (MSs) and extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) have been observed in nearly all Magellanic Clouds clusters younger than 2 Gyr. More recently, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet photometry uncovered a puzzling new population of UV-absorbed stars, dubbed UVdim, in five Magellanic Clouds clusters aged between 40 and 200 Myr, as well as in one 1.5 Gyr-old cluster. These UVdim stars predominantly lie on the blue MS, which is composed of slow rotators, and their distinct UV properties are believed to stem from dusty circumstellar disks. Although eMSTOs are common in both Magellanic Clouds and Galactic open clusters (OCs) of comparable ages, UVdim stars have not yet been investigated in Galactic OCs. In this work, we fill that gap by combining Swift/UVOT, SkyMapper, and Gaia photometry to extend the search for UVdim stars to 35 Galactic OCs younger than 2 Gyr. By constructing colour-colour diagrams analogous to those employed with HST WFC3/UVIS, we find no evidence of UVdim-like stars in most Galactic open clusters and identify possible UVdim candidates in only five systems. The rarity of UVdim stars in young OCs suggests a potential difference between Magellanic Cloud clusters and their Milky Way counterparts, although the underlying reason remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.</description>

      <title>Observability of Isolated Stellar-mass Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) represent the natural end states of massive stars. It is estimated that $10^8$ stellar-mass BHs are present in the Milky Way galaxy, a significant fraction of which are expected to be isolated. Despite their expected abundance, only about 20 have been detected so far - mostly in binary systems - with just one confirmed isolated black hole (IsoBH) identified via astrometric microlensing. In this study, we investigate the potential for detecting electromagnetic emissions from IsoBHs by generating synthetic model spectra of their emissions in different types of interstellar medium environments. These model spectra are then compared with current observational capabilities. We show that photons emitted by IsoBHs - especially those accreting material in dense environments or within the Solar neighborhood - should be readily detectable. However, confidently identifying these sources remains highly challenging. We conclude that a number of IsoBHs must already exist in current astronomical catalogs but have not been identified as such. We outline possible strategies for detection and identification of IsoBHs using the current and upcoming telescopes.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Volatile Gas in the Giant Impact Disk around the 150-Myr old HD 23514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of CO$_2$ gas emission around HD 23514, an F5V star in the $\sim$150 Myr-old Pleiades cluster, hosting one of the rare giant-impact disks with unique mineralogy dominated by silica dust. We show that the dust feature remains stable over several decades, and that the sub-$\mu$m grains, which give rise to the $\sim$9 $\mu$m feature, are co-spatial with the hot CO$_2$ molecules within the sub-au vicinity of the star. Examining the Spitzer spectrum taken 15 years earlier, we show that the CO$_2$ emission was also present at 4.3 $\sigma$ significance. The existence of tiny silica grains and volatile gas requires special conditions to prevent the rapid loss caused by stellar radiation pressure and photodissociation. We explore several pathways explaining the observed properties and suggest that a past giant impact and/or stripping atmospheric event, involving large bodies with volatile content similar to the carbonaceous chondritic material, can simultaneously explain both the silica and volatile emission. Our discovery provides an important context for the amount of volatiles that a newly formed planet or the largest planetesimals could retain during the giant impact phase in the early solar system evolution.</description>

      <title>A Joint JWST and HST View of Omega Centauri: Multiple Stellar Populations and Their Kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning $\sim$0.9 to $\sim$2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of $\sim$0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Metal Polluted White Dwarfs with 21 {\mu}m IR excesses from JWST/MIRI: Planets or Dust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs with metal pollution are caused by the accretion of rocky dust from tidally disrupted minor bodies and are signposts for planetary systems. These minor bodies are perturbed by planets that have survived post-main sequence evolution. Open questions exist as to the typical mass of the perturbers and the specific planetary architectures that cause metal pollution. JWST's sensitivity in the mid-IR has opened new doors to deciphering polluted white dwarfs. We present JWST Cycle 1 MIRI imaging of four nearby metal-polluted white dwarfs with the goal of detecting and characterizing planetary companions. With deep mid-IR imaging we are sensitive to cold Jupiter-mass planet analogs. In addition to finding two candidate planetary companions, for the first time we detect significant excesses above the expected photospheric emission at 21~$\mu$m for two of our targets, WD 2149+021 and WD 2105-820. WD 2105-280 has a candidate planetary companion at a projected separation of 34 au and an infrared excess--if both candidates are confirmed, it would represent the first WD multi-planet system. We investigate whether these excesses could be caused by very low luminosity warm dust disks or planets. While both are likely, we argue that the most likely explanation for the excesses is that they are the thermal emission from jovian-mass planets in orbits with semi-major axes $&lt;$10 au, using a combination of observational constraints. If most of the candidate planets presented here are confirmed, it would suggest that metal polluted white dwarfs are frequently orbited by at least one giant planet.</description>

      <title>Rubidium Abundances in Cool Giants from High-Resolution H-band Spectra: A New Diagnostic for Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center and inner disk of the Milky Way contain complex stellar populations obscured by heavy dust extinction. To study their chemical composition, high-resolution near-infrared (near-IR) spectroscopy is necessary. Expanding the set of elements measurable in the near-IR, especially neutron-capture elements, improves our ability to trace nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. This work aims to identify and characterize a spectral line suitable for determining rubidium (Rb) abundances. Rb is produced in roughly equal parts by the r- and s-processes. We analyze high-resolution (R = 45,000) IGRINS near-IR spectra of 40 M giants in the solar neighborhood, most observed with Gemini South. We perform spectral synthesis of the Rb I line at 15289.48 A, using new log(gf) values and including an astrophysical calibration of the blending Fe I lines. The resulting [Rb/Fe] ratios are compared to other neutron-capture elements and interpreted with chemical evolution models. We demonstrate that the used Rb line is a reliable abundance indicator in M giants and the coolest K giants, but becomes too weak at higher temperatures. [Rb/Fe] shows a decreasing trend with metallicity, mirroring that of ytterbium (Yb), another mixed r-/s-process element. Our results agree with optical studies, validating the use of this near-IR line. Comparisons with chemical evolution models confirm that both s- and r-process sources are needed to explain the Rb trend. This work adds Rb to the list of elements measurable in high-resolution H- and K-band spectra, enabling studies of one more neutron-capture element in dust-obscured regions like the Galactic Center and inner disk.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity massive single stars with rotation. III. Source of ionization and C-IV emission in I Zw 18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.</description>

Abstract: We present a homogeneous catalog of global asteroseismic parameters and derived stellar parameters for 765 Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars. The catalog was produced by re-analyzing all available Kepler DR25 short-cadence data using pySYD, an automated pipeline to extract global asteroseismic parameters. We find 50 new detections, seven of which are also planet candidate host stars. We find excellent agreement between our $\nu_{\text{max}}$ and $\Delta \nu$ measurements and literature values, with an average offset of $0.2 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=5\%$) and $0.2 \pm 0.7\%$ ($\sigma=2\%$), respectively. In addition, we derive stellar radii and masses with an average precision of $2.7\%$ and $10.4\%$, respectively, and find a mean offset of $0.8 \pm 0.2\%$ ($\sigma=6\%$) between our radii derived with asteroseismology and those from Gaia parallaxes. Using spectroscopic $\log{R'_{\text{HK}}}$ activity measurements from Keck/HIRES, we derive an amplitude scaling relation with an activity term for main-sequence and subgiant stars, which successfully predicts amplitudes with a precision of $\approx 8-9\%$. Our work is the largest and most homogeneous asteroseismic catalog of Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars to date, including a total of 101 stars hosting planet candidates and 451 stars with measured rotation periods.</description>

      <title>Role of non-thermal processes in the quiescent and active millimeter spectrum of a young M-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter (mm) emission from F - M dwarfs (cool stars) primarily traces chromospheric activity, with thermal emission thought to dominate in quiescence. Despite the high chromospheric activity, the quiescent mm spectral fluence (mm-S($\nu$)) of young (&lt; 1 Gyr) M dwarfs (dMs) remain largely unexplored. We present the quiescent mm-S($\nu$) of a young dM, ADLeo, observed around 94 GHz using the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA). The observed quiescent mm-S($\nu$) exceeds the thermal flux density from a 1D chromospheric model, constrained by optical-UV spectroscopic data, by up to a factor of 7. This indicates a quasi-steady non-thermal emission powered by supra-thermal electrons unlike in old (&gt; 1 Gyr) cool stars, whose quiescent mm-S($\nu$) generally agree with 1D thermal models. The mm-brightness temperature spectral index ($\alpha_{mm}$; $T_B(\nu)\propto \nu^{- \alpha_{mm}}$) of AD Leo deviates by a factor of 3 from the $\alpha_{mm}$ - $T_{eff}$ scaling law for old sun-like stars (Mohan, A., et al., 2022), while UV Ceti, an older M6V star, follows the trend. Also, we report a double-hump flare with second-scale variability in flux density and spectral index, and a frequency-rising nature with brightness increasing with frequency. The flare resemble certain solar events, but is unlike the second-scale events reported in dMs. The non-thermal flare humps suggest multiple injections of accelerated electrons. The mean flare luminosity (2 - 5 $\times 10^{15} erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1}$) and duration ($18\pm 2$ s) are comparable to flares reported in AU Mic and Proxima Cen, but 100 - 1000 times weaker than the minutes-long dM flares observed by the South Pole Telescope.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$ Effect and Magnetic Diffusivity $\beta$ in Helical Plasma under Turbulence Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in plasma systems with varying Reynolds numbers while maintaining a unit magnetic Prandtl number. {The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tensors parameterize the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) in terms of the large-scale magnetic field ${\bf \overline{B}}$ and current density ${\bf \overline{}}$ as follows : $\langle {\bf u}\times {\bf b} \rangle = \alpha {\bf \overline{B}}-\beta {\nabla\times \bf \overline{B}}$.} In astrophysical plasmas, high fluid Reynolds numbers ($Re$) and magnetic Reynolds numbers ($Re_\mathrm{M}$) drive turbulence, where $Re$ governs flow dynamics and $Re_\mathrm{M}$ controls magnetic field evolution. The coefficients $\alpha_{\text{semi}}$ and $\beta_{\text{semi}}$ are obtained from large-scale magnetic field data as estimates of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tensors, while $\beta_{\text{theo}}$ is derived from turbulent kinetic energy data. The reconstructed large-scale field $\overline{B}$ agrees with simulations, confirming consistency among $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\overline{B}$ in weakly nonlinear regimes. This highlights the need to incorporate magnetic effects under strong nonlinearity. To clarify $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we introduce a field structure model, identifying $\alpha$ as the electrodynamic induction effect and $\beta$ as the fluid-like diffusion effect. The agreement between our method and direct simulations suggests that plasma turbulence and magnetic interactions can be analyzed using fundamental physical quantities. Moreover, $\alpha_{\text{semi}}$ and $\beta_{\text{semi}}$, which successfully reproduce the numerically obtained magnetic field, provide a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes, we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic field geometry.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H\,{\sc{ii}} region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N$_{D}$/N$_{H}$ ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.</description>
