      <title>Optimal Regret of Bernoulli Bandits under Global Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As sequential learning algorithms are increasingly applied to real life, ensuring data privacy while maintaining their utilities emerges as a timely question. In this context, regret minimisation in stochastic bandits under $\epsilon$-global Differential Privacy (DP) has been widely studied. Unlike bandits without DP, there is a significant gap between the best-known regret lower and upper bound in this setting, though they "match" in order. Thus, we revisit the regret lower and upper bounds of $\epsilon$-global DP algorithms for Bernoulli bandits and improve both. First, we prove a tighter regret lower bound involving a novel information-theoretic quantity characterising the hardness of $\epsilon$-global DP in stochastic bandits. Our lower bound strictly improves on the existing ones across all $\epsilon$ values. Then, we choose two asymptotically optimal bandit algorithms, i.e. DP-KLUCB and DP-IMED, and propose their DP versions using a unified blueprint, i.e., (a) running in arm-dependent phases, and (b) adding Laplace noise to achieve privacy. For Bernoulli bandits, we analyse the regrets of these algorithms and show that their regrets asymptotically match our lower bound up to a constant arbitrary close to 1. This refutes the conjecture that forgetting past rewards is necessary to design optimal bandit algorithms under global DP. At the core of our algorithms lies a new concentration inequality for sums of Bernoulli variables under Laplace mechanism, which is a new DP version of the Chernoff bound. This result is universally useful as the DP literature commonly treats the concentrations of Laplace noise and random variables separately, while we couple them to yield a tighter bound.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Transport-Based Dissimilarity Measure for Time Series Classification under Warping Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important problem with numerous applications in science and technology. Dissimilarity-based approaches, such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), are classical methods for distinguishing time series when time deformations are confounding information. In this paper, starting from a deformation-based model for signal classes we define a problem statement for time series classification problem. We show that, under theoretically ideal conditions, a continuous version of classic 1NN-DTW method can solve the stated problem, even when only one training sample is available. In addition, we propose an alternative dissimilarity measure based on Optimal Transport and show that it can also solve the aforementioned problem statement at a significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the newly proposed approach in simulated and real time series classification data, showing the efficacy of the method.</description>

      <title>DaringFed: A Dynamic Bayesian Persuasion Pricing for Online Federated Learning under Two-sided Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Federated Learning (OFL) is a real-time learning paradigm that sequentially executes parameter aggregation immediately for each random arriving client. To motivate clients to participate in OFL, it is crucial to offer appropriate incentives to offset the training resource consumption. However, the design of incentive mechanisms in OFL is constrained by the dynamic variability of Two-sided Incomplete Information (TII) concerning resources, where the server is unaware of the clients' dynamically changing computational resources, while clients lack knowledge of the real-time communication resources allocated by the server. To incentivize clients to participate in training by offering dynamic rewards to each arriving client, we design a novel Dynamic Bayesian persuasion pricing for online Federated learning (DaringFed) under TII. Specifically, we begin by formulating the interaction between the server and clients as a dynamic signaling and pricing allocation problem within a Bayesian persuasion game, and then demonstrate the existence of a unique Bayesian persuasion Nash equilibrium. By deriving the optimal design of DaringFed under one-sided incomplete information, we further analyze the approximate optimal design of DaringFed with a specific bound under TII. Finally, extensive evaluation conducted on real datasets demonstrate that DaringFed optimizes accuracy and converges speed by 16.99%, while experiments with synthetic datasets validate the convergence of estimate unknown values and the effectiveness of DaringFed in improving the server's utility by up to 12.6%.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Integer Optimization for Responsible Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency, robustness, and privacy, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.</description>

      <title>Safe-EF: Error Feedback for Nonsmooth Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning faces severe communication bottlenecks due to the high dimensionality of model updates. Communication compression with contractive compressors (e.g., Top-K) is often preferable in practice but can degrade performance without proper handling. Error feedback (EF) mitigates such issues but has been largely restricted for smooth, unconstrained problems, limiting its real-world applicability where non-smooth objectives and safety constraints are critical. We advance our understanding of EF in the canonical non-smooth convex setting by establishing new lower complexity bounds for first-order algorithms with contractive compression. Next, we propose Safe-EF, a novel algorithm that matches our lower bound (up to a constant) while enforcing safety constraints essential for practical applications. Extending our approach to the stochastic setting, we bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation. Extensive experiments in a reinforcement learning setup, simulating distributed humanoid robot training, validate the effectiveness of Safe-EF in ensuring safety and reducing communication complexity.</description>

      <title>On expected signatures and signature cumulants in semimartingale models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of signatures and expected signatures is vital in data science, especially for sequential data analysis. The signature transform, a Cartan type development, translates paths into high-dimensional feature vectors, capturing their intrinsic characteristics. Under natural conditions, the expectation of the signature determines the law of the signature, providing a statistical summary of the data distribution. This property facilitates robust modeling and inference in machine learning and stochastic processes. Building on previous work by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected signatures, in a general semimartingale setting. Several new formulae are given. A log-transform of (expected) signatures leads to log-signatures (signature cumulants), offering a significant reduction in complexity.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Nuisance Function Estimation for Causal Mediation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2012) introduced an efficient, debiased, and robust influence function-based estimator for the mediation functional, which is the key component in mediation analysis. This estimator relies on the treatment, mediator, and outcome mean mechanisms. However, treating these three mechanisms as nuisance functions and fitting them as accurately as possible may not be the most effective approach. Instead, it is essential to identify the specific functionals and aspects of these mechanisms that impact the estimation of the mediation functional. In this work, we propose a two-stage estimation strategy for certain nuisance functions in the influence function of the mediation functional that are based on these three mechanisms. This strategy is guided by the role those nuisance functions play in the bias structure of the influence function-based estimator for the mediation functional. In the first stage, we estimate two primary nuisance functions, namely the inverse treatment mechanism and the outcome mean mechanism. In the second stage, we leverage these primary functions to estimate two additional nuisance functions that encapsulate the needed information about the mediator mechanism. We propose a nonparametric weighted balancing estimation approach to design the estimator for one of the nuisance functions in Stage 1 and one of in Stage 2, where the weights are designed directly based on the bias of the final estimator for the mediation functional. The remaining two nuisance functions are estimated using standard parametric or nonparametric regression methods. Once all four nuisance functions are obtained, they are incorporated into the influence function-based estimator. We provide a robustness analysis of the proposed method and establish sufficient conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator for the mediation functional.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Using techniques from stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate. This relation can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models with different noise schedules and different data. We numerically discuss our results for optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also demonstrate the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</description>

      <title>Distillation of Discrete Diffusion through Dimensional Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performances in various fields of generative modeling, but suffer from slow sampling speed due to their iterative nature. While this issue is being addressed in continuous domains, discrete diffusion models face unique challenges, particularly in capturing dependencies between elements (e.g., pixel relationships in image, sequential dependencies in language) mainly due to the computational cost of processing high-dimensional joint distributions. In this paper, (i) we propose "mixture" models for discrete diffusion that are capable of treating dimensional correlations while remaining scalable, and (ii) we provide a set of loss functions for distilling the iterations of existing models. Two primary theoretical insights underpin our approach: First, conventional models with element-wise independence can well approximate the data distribution, but essentially require {\it many sampling steps}. Second, our loss functions enable the mixture models to distill such many-step conventional models into just a few steps by learning the dimensional correlations. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling pretrained discrete diffusion models across image and language domains.

      <title>k-LLMmeans: Scalable, Stable, and Interpretable Text Clustering via LLM-based Centroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce k-LLMmeans, a novel modification of the k-means algorithm for text clustering that leverages LLM-generated summaries as cluster centroids, capturing semantic nuances often missed by purely numerical averages. This design preserves the core optimization properties of k-means while enhancing semantic interpretability and avoiding the scalability and instability issues typical of modern LLM-based clustering. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not increase LLM usage with dataset size and produces transparent intermediate outputs. We further extend it with a mini-batch variant for efficient, real-time clustering of streaming text. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, embeddings, and LLMs show that k-LLMmeans consistently outperforms k-means and other traditional baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based clustering, with a fraction of the LLM calls. Finally, we present a case study on sequential text streams and introduce a new benchmark dataset constructed from StackExchange to evaluate text-stream clustering methods.</description>

      <title>From Observation to Orientation: an Adaptive Integer Programming Approach to Intervention Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using both observational and experimental data, a causal discovery process can identify the causal relationships between variables. A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</description>
