      <title>Boone-Higman embeddings of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ and mapping class groups of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the groups $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ satisfy the Boone-Higman conjecture for all $n$, meaning each $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ embeds in a finitely presented simple group. In fact, we prove that each $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ satisfies the "permutational" Boone-Higman conjecture, which means the simple group in question can be taken to be a twisted Brin-Thompson group. A far-reaching consequence of our approach is that finitely presented twisted Brin-Thompson groups are universal among finitely presented simple groups that are highly transitive. This is evidence toward the Boone-Higman conjecture being equivalent to its permutational version. Proving the conjecture for $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ also confirms the conjecture for all groups (virtually) embedding into some $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$, such as mapping class groups of non-closed surfaces, braid groups, loop braid groups, ribbon braid groups and certain Artin groups. This answers several questions of the first and fourth authors with Bleak and Matucci. Yet another consequence of our approach is that satisfying the permutational Boone-Higman conjecture is closed under free products.</description>

      <title>Hayashi Property for Conjugation Quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive description of conjugation quandles and their connectedness. In this context, we find a characterization of Hayashi's conjecture (2013) in terms of a centrality condition of groups. This condition is thus a conjecture itself and it states that powers of elements of a finite and generating conjugacy classes should be central whenever they commute with one particular element of this class. We prove this condition in several cases, e.g. for finite nilpotent, symmetric, alternating, and dihedral groups. All of these results translate to Hayashi's conjecture for the corresponding conjugation quandles.</description>

      <title>Non vanishing of the fourth bounded cohomology of free groups and codimension 2 subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we prove that the fouth bounded cohomology of non-abelian free
  groups with trivial real coefficients is non-zero. In order to prove this, we
  establish a splitting argument whose simplest form is as follows: Let
  $M$ denote an $n$-manifold of non-zero simplicial volume and
  $S$ a codimension two submanifold of $M$, then one can
  conclude that the $n$-th bounded cohomology of the fundamental group of
  $M \setminus S$ is non-zero.
  While in this note this approach is only used for degree $4$. There is no
  reason to expect that this approach and its generalizations is not suitable
  to prove the non-vanishing of higher degrees or the bounded cohomology of
  different groups as well.</description>

      <title>Pseudovarieties of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most developed aspect of the theory of finite semigroups is their classification in pseudovarieties. The main motivation for investigating such entities comes from their connection with the classification of regular languages via Eilenberg's correspondence. This connection prompted the study of various natural operators on pseudovarieties and led to several important questions, both algebraic and algorithmic. The most important of these questions is decidability: given a finite semigroup is there an algorithm that tests whether it belongs to the pseudovariety? Since the most relevant operators on pseudovarieties do not preserve decidability, one often seeks to establish stronger properties. A key role is played by relatively free profinite semigroups, which is the counterpart of free algebras in universal algebra. The purpose of this paper is to give a brief survey of the state of the art, highlighting some of the main developments and problems.</description>

      <title>Schur ultrafilters and Bohr compactifications of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Schur ultrafilters on groups. Using the algebraic structure of Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications of discrete groups and Schur ultrafilters, we give a new description of Bohr compactifications of topological groups. This approach allows us to characterize chart groups that are topological groups. Namely, a chart group $G$ is a topological group if and only if each Schur ultrafilter on $G$ converges to the unit of $G$.</description>
