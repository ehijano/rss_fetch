      <title>Electric field dependent g factors of YbOH molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbOH molecule is one of the most sensitive systems for the electron electric dipole moment ($e$EDM) searches. Zeeman splittings of the $e$EDM sensitive levels have significant implications to control and suppress important systematic effects due to stray magnetic field in experiments for $e$EDM searches. The electric-field-dependent g factors of the lowest rotational level of the first excited bending vibrational mode of $^{174}$YbOH are calculated. l-doublet levels with small g factors difference are found and main contributions to the difference are determined.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable circular polarization medium frequency atomic receiver using magneto-electric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear magnetoelectric effect(NME) in alkali atomic vapor has applications in precision magnetometry in the radio-frequency domain. We report the application of the NME in alkali atomic vapors for projective measurement of medium-frequency (MF) magnetic fields in a circular basis with an extinction ratio up to 500:1 . Utilizing a longitudinal static magnetic field, we demonstrate a high-sensitivity technique for characterizing the ellipticity of radio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields which can in turn be used for phase sensitive detection in mid frequency communication. Additionally, we demonstrate the conversion of binary phase shift keyed RF magnetic fields into amplitude modulation of generated optical fields, a versatile receiver for communication using the medium frequency band.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and Electron Correlation Effects in Static Dipole Polarizabilities for Main-Group Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, I compute the static dipole polarizability of main-group elements using the finite-field method combined with relativistic coupled-cluster and configuration interaction simulations. The computational results closely align with the values recommended in the 2018 table of static dipole polarizabilities of neutral elements [Mol. Phys. 117, 1200 (2019)]. Additionally, I investigate the influence of relativistic effects and electron correlation on atomic dipole polarizabilities. Specifically, three types of relativistic effects impacting dipole polarizabilities are studied: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling, and fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb effects. The results indicate that scalar-relativistic effects are predominant for atoms in Groups 1--2, with minimal influence from spin-orbit coupling effects. Conversely, for elements in Groups 13--18, scalar-relativistic effects are less significant, while spin-orbit coupling significantly affects elements starting from the fourth row in Groups 13--14 and from the fifth row in Groups 15--18. In each category of relativistic effects, the impact of electron correlation is evaluated. The results show that electron correlation significantly influences dipole polarizability calculations, particularly for Groups 1--2 and 13--14 atoms, but is less significant for Groups 15--18 atoms. This study provides a comprehensive and consistent dataset of dipole polarizabilities and contributes to a systematic understanding of the roles of relativistic and electron correlation effects in atomic dipole polarizabilities, serving as a valuable reference for future research.</description>

      <title>Observation of Asymmetric Sideband Generation in Strongly-driven Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the bandwidth of Rydberg atom-based receivers is an ongoing challenge owing to the long-lived Rydberg state lifetimes that limit the refresh rate of ground state atoms. In particular, the LO-based Rydberg mixer approach allows for bandwidths into the few-MHz range. Here, we use heterodyne detection of the Rydberg atom receiver probe laser to separate the negative and positive sidebands that originate from distinct six wave mixing processes, in order to investigate their individual bandwidths. We experimentally confirm the prediction that the negative sideband exhibits a higher bandwidth than the positive sideband. We further explore the effect of coupling and probe laser Rabi frequency on the bandwidth, which we find to be in good agreement with our model. We achieved a maximum experimental (and theoretical) bandwidth of about 11 (11) MHz and 3.5 (5) MHz for the negative and positive sidebands, respectively, from the -3dB roll-off point for optimized field parameters. This work provides insight into the bandwidth-limiting features of Rydberg atom receivers and points the way towards further optimization of their response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic spectroscopy can be used to search for new bosons that carry exotic forces between elementary fermions. A comparison of a recent precise measurement [Bullis \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{130}, 203001 (2023)] of the hyperfine splitting of the 2S$_{1/2}$ electronic levels of hydrogen and up-to-date bound-state quantum electrodynamics theory yields improved constraints on electron-proton exotic interactions of the dimensionless coupling strengths $g_pg_p$ and $g_Ag_A$, corresponding to the exchange of a pseudoscalar (axionlike) or axial-vector boson, respectively.</description>

      <title>Search for fast-oscillating fundamental constants with space missions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is possible to estimate the dark matter density at the Sun distance from the galactic center, this does not give information on actual dark matter density in the Solar system. There can be considerable local enhancement of dark matter density in the vicinity of gravitating centers, including the Sun, the Earth, as well as other planets in the solar system. Generic mechanisms for the formation of such halos were recently elucidated. In this work, we studies the possible halo dark matter overdensities and corresponding dark matter masses allowed for various objects in the solar system. We explore spacecraft missions to detect such halos with instruments such as quantum clocks, atomic and molecular spectrometers designed to search for fast (tens of hertz to gigahertz) oscillations of fundamental constants, highly sensitive comagnetometers, and other quantum sensors and sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions that carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped ``flag'' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that such uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (i) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (ii) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (iii) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave the way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthetic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>A universal neutral-atom quantum computer with individual optical addressing and non-destructive readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss events excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and highlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</description>
