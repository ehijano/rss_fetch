      <title>Cloudy with a Chance of Green: Measuring the Predictability of 18,009 Traffic Lights in Hamburg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informing drivers about the predicted state of upcoming traffic lights is considered a key solution to reduce unneeded energy expenditure and dilemma zones at intersections. However, newer traffic lights can react to traffic demand, resulting in spontaneous switching behavior and poor predictability. To assess whether future traffic light assistance services are viable, it is crucial to understand how strongly predictability is affected by such spontaneous switching behavior. Previous studies have so far only reported percentages of adaptivity-capable traffic lights, but the actual switching behavior has not been measured. Addressing this research gap, we conduct a large-scale predictability evaluation based on 424 million recorded switching cycles over four weeks for 18,009 individual traffic lights in Hamburg. Two characteristics of predictability are studied: cycle discrepancy and wait time diversity. Results indicate that fewer traffic lights exhibit hard-to-predict switching behavior than suggested by previous work, considering a reported number of 90.7% adaptive traffic lights in Hamburg. Contrasting previous work, we find that not all traffic lights capable of adaptiveness may necessarily exhibit low predictability. We critically review these results and derive avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Wireless Networks with Deep Unfolding: Comparative Study on Two Deep Unfolding Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a comparative study on two deep unfolding mechanisms to efficiently perform power control in the next generation wireless networks. The power control problem is formulated as energy efficiency over multiple interference links. The problem is nonconvex. We employ fractional programming transformation to design two solutions for the problem. The first solution is a numerical solution while the second solution is a closed-form solution. Based on the first solution, we design a semi-unfolding deep learning model where we combine the domain knowledge of the wireless communications and the recent advances in the data-driven deep learning. Moreover, on the highlights of the closed-form solution, fully deep unfolded deep learning model is designed in which we fully leveraged the expressive closed-form power control solution and deep learning advances. In the simulation results, we compare the performance of the proposed deep learning models and the iterative solutions in terms of accuracy and inference speed to show their suitability for the real-time application in next generation networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Modulation Classification of Practical OFDM Signals for Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the modulation of symbols on OFDM subcarriers is classified for transmissions following Wi-Fi~6 and 5G downlink specifications. First, our approach estimates the OFDM symbol duration and cyclic prefix length based on the cyclic autocorrelation function. We propose a feature extraction algorithm characterizing the modulation of OFDM signals, which includes removing the effects of a synchronization error. The obtained feature is converted into a 2D histogram of phase and amplitude and this histogram is taken as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier. The classifier does not require prior knowledge of protocol-specific information such as Wi-Fi preamble or resource allocation of 5G physical channels. The classifier's performance, evaluated using synthetic and real-world measured over-the-air (OTA) datasets, achieves a minimum accuracy of 97\% accuracy with OTA data when SNR is above the value required for data transmission.</description>

      <title>Efficient Anchor Point Deployment for Low Latency Connectivity in MEC-Assisted C-V2X Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation cellular networks will play a key role in the evolution of different vertical industries. Low latency will be a major requirement in many related uses cases. This requirement is specially challenging in scenarios with high mobility of end devices, such as vehicular communications. The Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm seeks to satisfy it. In this article we propose the dynamic deployment of anchor point network functions at edge locations and the assignment of terminals to these anchor points with the joint objective of minimizing communications latency and reducing network overhead. We formally define the problem as a multi-objective optimization and also propose a novel heuristic greedy algorithm for approximating the solution. This algorithm compares favorably with baseline and state-of-the-art strategies for latency minimization while reducing the overhead caused by network reconfigurations.</description>

      <title>A Software-Defined Networking Solution for Interconnecting Network Functions in Service-Based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile core networks handle critical control functions for delivering services in modern cellular networks. Traditional point-to-point architectures, where network functions are directly connected through standardized interfaces, are being substituted by service-based architectures (SBAs), where core functionalities are finer-grained microservices decoupled from the underlying infrastructure. In this way, network functions and services can be distributed, with scaling and fail-over mechanisms, and can be dynamically deployed, updated, or removed to support slicing. A myriad of network functions can be deployed or removed according to traffic flows, thereby increasing the complexity of connection management. In this context, 3GPP Release 16 defines the service communication proxy (SCP) as a unified communication interface for a set of network functions. In this paper, we propose a novel software-defined networking (SDN)-based solution with the same role for a service mesh architecture where network functions can be deployed anywhere in the infrastructure. We demonstrated its efficiency in comparison with alternative architectures.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Allocation of Radio Resources to Wi-Fi and Cellular Technologies in Shared Unlicensed Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless connectivity is essential for industrial production processes and workflow management. Moreover, the connectivity requirements of industrial devices, which are usually long-term investments, are diverse and require different radio interfaces. In this regard, the 3GPP has studied how to support heterogeneous radio access technologies (RATs) such as Wi-Fi and unlicensed cellular technologies in 5G core networks. In some cases, these technologies coexist in the same spectrum. Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), which has already been proven to increase spectrum efficiency in licensed bands, can also be applied to this scenario. In this paper, we propose two solutions for mobile network operators (MNOs) or service providers to dynamically divide (multiplex) the radio resources of a shared channel between a Wi-Fi basic service set (BSS) and one or several carriers of scheduled wireless networks, such as cellular technologies, with a configurable level of sharing granularity. These solutions do not require modifications to the current commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) end devices. We adapt the existing IEEE 802.11 procedures to notify the Wi-Fi stations that they must share channels with different access networks. We demonstrate that our dynamic sharing proposals are also advantageous over direct coexistence and evaluate each of them quantitatively and qualitatively to determine when one or the other is preferable. The evaluation is particularized for IEEE 802.11ac and long-term evolution (LTE) license assisted access (LAA), but the solutions can be easily extended to 5G new radio-unlicensed (5G NR-U) or to any other wireless technology in which the network side schedules end device transmissions.</description>

      <title>Cloudy with a Chance of Cyberattacks: Dangling Resources Abuse on Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works showed that it is feasible to hijack resources on cloud platforms. In such hijacks, attackers can take over released resources that belong to legitimate organizations. It was proposed that adversaries could abuse these resources to carry out attacks against customers of the hijacked services, e.g., through malware distribution. However, to date, no research has confirmed the existence of these attacks. We identify, for the first time, real-life hijacks of cloud resources. This yields a number of surprising and important insights. First, contrary to previous assumption that attackers primarily target IP addresses, our findings reveal that the type of resource is not the main consideration in a hijack. Attackers focus on hijacking records that allow them to determine the resource by entering freetext. The costs and overhead of hijacking such records are much lower than those of hijacking IP addresses, which are randomly selected from a large pool. Second, identifying hijacks poses a substantial challenge. Monitoring resource changes, e.g., changes in content, is insufficient, since such changes could also be legitimate. Retrospective analysis of digital assets to identify hijacks is also arduous due to the immense volume of data involved and the absence of indicators to search for. To address this challenge, we develop a novel approach that involves analyzing data from diverse sources to effectively differentiate between malicious and legitimate modifications. Our analysis has revealed 20,904 instances of hijacked resources on popular cloud platforms. While some hijacks are short-lived (up to 15 days), 1/3 persist for more than 65 days. We study how attackers abuse the hijacked resources and find that, in contrast to the threats considered in previous work, the majority of the abuse (75%) is blackhat search engine optimization.</description>

      <title>Tiny Graph Neural Networks for Radio Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surge in demand for efficient radio resource management has necessitated the development of sophisticated yet compact neural network architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) tailored for radio resource management by presenting a new architecture: the Low Rank Message Passing Graph Neural Network (LR-MPGNN). The cornerstone of LR-MPGNN is the implementation of a low-rank approximation technique that substitutes the conventional linear layers with their low-rank counterparts. This innovative design significantly reduces the model size and the number of parameters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed LR-MPGNN model based on several key metrics: model size, number of parameters, weighted sum rate of the communication system, and the distribution of eigenvalues of weight matrices. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that the LR-MPGNN model achieves a sixtyfold decrease in model size, and the number of model parameters can be reduced by up to 98%. Performance-wise, the LR-MPGNN demonstrates robustness with a marginal 2% reduction in the best-case scenario in the normalized weighted sum rate compared to the original MPGNN model. Additionally, the distribution of eigenvalues of the weight matrices in the LR-MPGNN model is more uniform and spans a wider range, suggesting a strategic redistribution of weights.</description>

      <title>O-RAN for Energy-Efficient Serving Cluster Formulation in User-Centric Cell-Free MMIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 6G Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MMIMO) networks can follow the so-called User-Centric Cell-Free (UCCF) architecture, where a single user is served by multiple Access Points (APs) coordinated by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). In this paper, we propose how O-RAN functionalities, i.e., rApp-xApp pair, can be used for energy-efficient Serving Cluster Formulation (SCF). Simulation studies show up to 37\% gain in Energy Efficiency (EE) of the proposed solution over the state-of-the-art Network-Centric (NC) designs.</description>

      <title>BFT-PoLoc: A Byzantine Fortified Trigonometric Proof of Location Protocol using Internet Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internet platforms depend on accurately determining the geographical locations of online users to deliver targeted services (e.g., advertising). The advent of decentralized platforms (blockchains) emphasizes the importance of geographically distributed nodes, making the validation of locations more crucial. In these decentralized settings, mutually non-trusting participants need to {\em prove} their locations to each other. The incentives for claiming desired location include decentralization properties (validators of a blockchain), explicit rewards for improving coverage (physical infrastructure blockchains) and regulatory compliance -- and entice participants towards prevaricating their true location malicious via VPNs, tampering with internet delays, or compromising other parties (challengers) to misrepresent their location. Traditional delay-based geolocation methods focus on reducing the noise in measurements and are very vulnerable to wilful divergences from prescribed protocol.
  In this paper we use Internet delay measurements to securely prove the location of IP addresses while being immune to a large fraction of Byzantine actions. Our core methods are to endow Internet telemetry tools (e.g., ping) with cryptographic primitives (signatures and hash functions) together with Byzantine resistant data inferences subject to Euclidean geometric constraints. We introduce two new networking protocols, robust against Byzantine actions: Proof of Internet Geometry (PoIG) converts delay measurements into precise distance estimates across the Internet; Proof of Location (PoLoc) enables accurate and efficient multilateration of a specific IP address. The key algorithmic innovations are in conducting ``Byzantine fortified trigonometry" (BFT) inferences of data, endowing low rank matrix completion methods with Byzantine resistance.</description>
