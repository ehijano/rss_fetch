      <title>Visual Authority and the Rhetoric of Health Misinformation: A Multimodal Analysis of Social Media Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.</description>

      <title>Identifying Group Anchors in Real-World Group Interactions Under Label Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&amp;A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&amp;A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.</description>

      <title>Influence of the majority group on individual judgments in online spontaneous conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how the majority group influences individual judgment formation and expression in anonymous, spontaneous online conversations. Drawing on theories of social conformity and anti-conformity, we analyze everyday dilemmas discussed on social media. First, using digital traces to operationalize judgments, we measure the conversations' disagreement and apply Bayesian regression to capture shifts of judgments formation before and after the group's exposure. Then we analyze changes in judgment expression with a linguistic analysis of the motivations associated with each judgment. Results show systematic anti-conformity behaviors: individuals preserve the majority's positive or negative orientation of judgments but diverge from its stance, with persuasive language increasing post-disclosure. Our findings highlight how online environments reshape social influence compared to offline contexts.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Measurement of Technological Convergence through Heterogeneous Graph and Semantic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</description>

      <title>Evading Overlapping Community Detection via Proxy Node Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community, regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice, but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Evaluating Dynamic Network Generative Models and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding dynamic systems like disease outbreaks, social influence, and information diffusion requires effective modeling of complex networks. Traditional evaluation methods for static networks often fall short when applied to temporal networks. This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507). These findings highlight DGSP-GCN's effectiveness in evaluating and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks, offering valuable insights for network evolution and anomaly detection research.</description>

      <title>AMLgentex: Mobilizing Data-Driven Research to Combat Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by moving illicit funds into the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, detection rates remain low because launderers evade oversight, confirmed cases are rare, and institutions see only fragments of the global transaction network. Since access to real transaction data is tightly restricted, synthetic datasets are essential for developing and evaluating detection methods. However, existing datasets fall short: they often neglect partial observability, temporal dynamics, strategic behavior, uncertain labels, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. We introduce AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. AMLGentex enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering systems under conditions that mirror real-world challenges. By releasing multiple country-specific datasets and practical parameter guidance, we aim to empower researchers and practitioners and provide a common foundation for collaboration and progress in combating money laundering.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Frequency--Domain Inference of Network Topology and Hidden Components via Structure--Behavior Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hidden interactions and components in complex systems-ranging from covert actors in terrorist networks to unobserved brain regions and molecular regulators-often manifest only through indirect behavioral signals. Inferring the underlying network structure from such partial observations remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under nonlinear dynamics. We uncover a robust linear relationship between the spectral strength of a node's behavioral time series under evolutionary game dynamics and its structural degree, $S \propto k$, a structural-behavioral scaling that holds across network types and scales, revealing a universal correspondence between local connectivity and dynamic energy. Leveraging this insight, we develop a deterministic, frequency-domain inference framework based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) that reconstructs network topology directly from payoff sequences-without prior knowledge of the network or internal node strategies-by selectively perturbing node dynamics. The framework simultaneously localizes individual hidden nodes or identifies all edges connected to multiple hidden nodes, and estimates tight bounds on the number of hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both topology reconstruction and hidden component detection. Moreover, it scales efficiently to large networks, offering robustness to stochastic fluctuations and overcoming the size limitations of existing techniques. Our work establishes a principled connection between local dynamic observables and global structural inference, enabling accurate topology recovery in complex systems with hidden elements.</description>

      <title>Examining the Prevalence and Dynamics of AI-Generated Media in Art Subreddits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadly accessible generative AI models like Dall-E have made it possible for anyone to create compelling visual art. In online communities, the introduction of AI-generated content (AIGC) may impact social dynamics, for example causing changes in who is posting content, or shifting the norms or the discussions around the posted content if posts are suspected of being generated by AI. We take steps towards examining the potential impact of AIGC on art-related communities on Reddit. We distinguish between communities that disallow AI content and those without such a direct policy. We look at image-based posts in these communities where the author transparently shares that the image was created by AI, and at comments in these communities that suspect or accuse authors of using generative AI. We find that AI posts (and accusations) have played a surprisingly small part in these communities through the end of 2023, accounting for fewer than 0.5% of the image-based posts. However, even as the absolute number of author-labeled AI posts dwindles over time, accusations of AI use remain more persistent. We show that AI content is more readily used by newcomers and may help increase participation if it aligns with community rules. However, the tone of comments suspecting AI use by others has become more negative over time, especially in communities that do not have explicit rules about AI. Overall, the results show the changing norms and interactions around AIGC in online communities designated for creativity.</description>
