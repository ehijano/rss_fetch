      <title>Secular Perturbations from Exterior Giants Strongly Influence Gap Complexity in Peas-in-a-Pod Exoplanetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that systems of tightly packed inner planets with giant exterior companions tend to have less regular orbital spacings than those without such companions. We investigate whether this observed increase in the gap complexity of the inner systems can be explained solely as the result of secular dynamics caused by the disturbing potential of the exterior companions. Amplification of mutual orbital inclinations in the inner system due to such secular dynamics may lead to the inner system attaining non-mutually transiting geometries, thereby creating artificial observed gaps that result in a higher calculated gap complexity. Using second-order secular theory, we compute time-averaged observed gap complexities along a favorable line of sight for a set of hypothetical systems, both with and without an outer giant. We find that these secular interactions can significantly contribute to the observed gap complexity dichotomy in tightly packed multiple-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Habitability in 4-D: Predicting the Climates of Earth Analogs across Rotation and Orbital Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth-like planets in the circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) may have dramatically different climate outcomes depending on their spin-orbit parameters, altering their habitability for life as we know it. We present a suite of 93 ROCKE-3D general circulation models (GCMs) for planets with the same surface conditions and average annual insolation as Earth, but with a wide range of rotation periods, obliquities, orbital eccentricities, and longitudes of periastra. Our habitability metric $f_\mathrm{HZ}$ is calculated based on the temperature and precipitation in each model across grid cells over land. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) aids in sampling all 4 of the spin-orbit parameters with a computationally feasible number of GCM runs. Statistical emulation then allows us to model $f_\mathrm{HZ}$ as a smooth function with built-in estimates of statistical uncertainty. We fit our emulator to an initial set of 46 training runs, then test with an additional 46 runs at different spin-orbit values. Our emulator predicts the directly GCM-modeled habitability values for the test runs at the appropriate level of accuracy and precision. For orbital eccentricities up to 0.225, rotation period remains the primary driver of the fraction of land that remains above freezing and with precipitation above a threshold value. For rotation periods greater than $\sim 20$ days, habitability drops significantly (from $\sim 70$% to $\sim 20$%), driven primarily by cooler land temperatures. Obliquity is a significant secondary factor for rotation periods less than $\sim 20$ Earth days, with a factor of two impact on habitability that is maximized at intermediate obliquity.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Core-Envelope Rotational Misalignment in the Mixed-Mode Asteroseismology of Kepler-56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate around a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or their possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope out of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive perturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto unexamined rotational configurations, under the ``shellular approximation'' of constant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned case, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by the inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes this to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the phenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red giants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical degeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology that results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56 -- a red giant with a misaligned planetary system -- I find that its core and envelope rotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core is indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets (consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to lying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed asteroseismic modelling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully elucidate the full spin-orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially discriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.</description>

      <title>Computing Classical Orbital Elements with Improved Efficiency and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the standard algorithm for converting spacecraft state vectors to Keplerian orbital elements with a focus on its computer implementation. It analyzes the shortcomings of the scheme as described in the literature, and proposes changes to the implementation to address orbits of arbitrary eccentricity and inclination in a simple and robust way. It presents two coding strategies that simplify the program structure while improving the accuracy and speed of the transformation on modern computer architectures. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks demonstrate accuracy improvements by two orders of magnitude, together with a 40% reduction of computational cost relative to the standard implementation.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PV-Wind-Battery Power System for a Mars Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery power system designed to sustain a Mars base under varying seasonal and climatic conditions. The Mars Climate Database was utilized to simulate the effects of seasonal changes, diurnal cycles, and dust storms on the system's power generation. The seasonal performance was analyzed across the Martian surface and at potential habitation sites proposed in the "First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW).'' Within the hybrid system, the photovoltaic arrays serve as the primary energy source, with wind turbines providing essential backup during nighttime and dust storms. A single $1\,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ photovoltaic array, a $33.4\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter wind turbine, and a $312\,\mathrm{kWh}$ battery can support a six-person Mars base at $32.1\%$ of the Martian surface during the equinoxes and solstices, expanding to $51.7\%$ with three sets of arrays and turbines. Additionally, $24$ FLSW sites can be supported throughout the solstices and equinoxes by a single photovoltaic array, turbine, and battery, even during global dust storms. Among the $24$ sites, Hebrus Valles, Huygens Crater, and Noctis Labyrinthus had the highest energy production potential. These findings are expected to guide further research on hybrid renewable power systems for Mars exploration.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97$\%$ of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. External comparisons indicate that the resulting precision for turn-off stars is 20$\%$ in age; for dwarf stars, it is 0.07 $M_{\odot}$ in mass, 0.05 $R_{\odot}$ in radius, and 0.12 dex in surface gravity; and for giant stars, it is 0.14 $M_{\odot}$ in mass, 0.73 $R_{\odot}$ in radius, and 0.11 dex in surface gravity.</description>
