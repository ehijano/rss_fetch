      <title>Piecewise integrability of the discrete Hasimoto map for analytic prediction and design of helical peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation of protein backbone geometry through the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation provides a theoretical connection between biological structure and integrable systems. Although the global application of this framework is constrained by chiral degeneracies and non-local interactions we propose that helical peptides can be effectively modeled as piecewise integrable systems in which the discrete Hasimoto map remains applicable within specific geometric boundaries. We delineate these boundaries through an analytic characterization of the mapping between biochemical dihedral angles and Frenet frame parameters for a dataset of 50 helical peptide chains. We demonstrate that the transformation is information-preserving globally but ill-conditioned within the helical basin characterized by a median Jacobian condition number of 31 which suggests that the loss of chiral information arises primarily from local coordinate compression rather than topological singularities. We define a local integrability error $E[n]$ derived from the discrete dispersion relation to show that deviations from integrability are driven predominantly by torsion non-uniformity while curvature remains structurally rigid. This metric identifies integrable islands where the analytic dispersion relation predicts backbone coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy yielding a median root-mean-square deviation of 0.77\,\AA\ and enables a segmentation strategy that isolates structural defects. We further indicate that the inverse design of peptide backbones is feasible within a quantitatively defined integrability zone where the design constraint reduces essentially to the control of torsion uniformity. These findings advance the Hasimoto formalism from a qualitative descriptor toward a precise quantitative framework for analyzing and designing local protein geometry within the limits of piecewise integrability.</description>

      <title>Pore-level Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) for Water Permeation Rate in Aquaporins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14355</link>

Abstract: Aquaporins (AQPs) and aquaglyceroporins (AQGPs) play a crucial role in regulating water transport and solute selectivity across biological membranes. Besides their biological relevance, AQPs have at-tracted growing interest as models for the design of next-generation biomimetic membranes for water filtration. In this work, we present a pore-level Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approach that relates structural and physicochemical pore descriptors with experimentally reported water permeation rates across a set of AQ(G)Ps with high-resolution 3D structures. This data-driven methodology, presented here as a proof of concept, introduces a multi-feature framework for determining pore descriptors associated with water transport efficiency in AQ(G)Ps. Applied to two compiled permeation rate datasets, this framework recapitulates determinants previously reported in single-feature studies, while also highlighting additional pore descriptors that emerge as relevant in a multi-variable context. The insights gained through this approach may, in perspective, contribute to advancing the rational design of AQP-based filtration devices and to deepening the molecular understanding of the function of these valuable macromolecules in health and disease.</description>

      <title>Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, i.e., the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a stylized model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Furthermore, our results underscore that a proper balance between neutral and non-neutral mutations is needed for the emergence of functional bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>SEISMO: Increasing Sample Efficiency in Molecular Optimization with a Trajectory-Aware LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the structure of molecules to achieve desired properties is a central bottleneck across the chemical sciences, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where it underlies the discovery of new drugs. Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</description>
