      <title>Torsional parallel plate flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluids with wall slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of wall slip on the apparent flow curves of viscoplastic materials obtained using torsional parallel plate rheometers is analysed by considering Herschel-Bulkley fluids and assuming that slip occurs above a critical wall shear stress, the slip yield stress {\tau}_c, taken to be lower than the yield stress, {\tau}_0. Thus, different flow regimes are encountered as the angular velocity of the experiment is increased. When the rim shear stress {\tau}_R is below the slip yield stress, the exerted torque is not sufficient to rotate the disk and the material remains still. When {\tau}_c&lt;{\tau}_R&lt;{\tau}_0 the material is still unyielded but exhibits wall slip and rotates as a solid at half the angular velocity of the rotating disk. Finally, when {\tau}_R&gt;{\tau}_0, the material exhibits slip everywhere and yields only in the annulus r_0&lt;r&lt;R, where r_0 is the critical radius at which the shear stress is equal to the yield stress and R is the radius of the disks. In the general case, the slip velocity, which varies with the radial distance, can be calculated numerically and then all quantities of interest, such as the true shear rate, and the two branches of the apparent flow curve can be computed by means of closed form expressions. Analytical solutions have also been obtained for certain values of the power-law exponent. In order to illustrate the effect of wall slip on the apparent flow curve and on the torque, results have been obtained for different gap sizes between the disks choosing the values of the rheological and slip parameters to be similar to reported values for certain colloidal suspensions. The computed apparent flow curves reproduce the patterns observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Scheme based on Positivity Preservation with Exact Shock Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a kinetic model with flexible velocities which are set to satisfy positivity preservation conditions for the Euler equations. Our kinetic model in 1D comprises of two velocities, and both the asymmetrical and the symmetrical models are utilized. Switching between the two models is done based on our own version of kinetic relative entropy and an additional criterion, to ensure an accurate, entropic and robust scheme. In 2D, we describe a novel three-velocity kinetic model, defined to ensure a locally 1D formulation for the resulting macroscopic normal flux. For first order accuracy, we also obtain a limit on the time step which ensures positivity preservation. The resulting numerical scheme captures grid-aligned steady shocks exactly. Several benchmark compressible flow test cases are solved in 1D and 2D to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver.</description>

      <title>Equatorial blowup and polar caps in drop electrohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illuminate effects of surface-charge convection intrinsic to leaky-dielectric electrohydrodynamics by analyzying the symmetric steady state of a circular drop in an external field at arbitrary electric Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}_E$. In formulating the problem, we identify an exact factorization that reduces the number of dimensionless parameters from four -- $\mathrm{Re}_E$ and the conductivity, permittivity and viscosity ratios -- to two: a modified electric Reynolds number $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ and a charging parameter $\varpi$. In the case $\varpi&lt;0$, where charge relaxation in the drop phase is slower than in the suspending phase, and, as a consequence, the interface polarizes antiparallel to the external field, we find that above a critical $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ value the solution exhibits a blowup singularity such that the surface-charge density diverges antisymmetrically with the $-1/3$ power of distance from the equator. We use local analysis to uncover the structure of that blowup singularity, wherein surface charges are convected by a locally induced flow towards the equator where they annihilate. To study the blowup regime, we devise a numerical scheme encoding that local structure where the blowup prefactor is determined by a global charging -- annihilation balance. We also employ asymptotic analysis to construct a universal problem governing the blowup solutions in the regime $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}\gg1$, far beyond the blowup threshold. In the case $\varpi&gt;0$, where charge relaxation is faster in the drop phase and the interface polarizes parallel to the external field, we numerically observe and asymptotically characterize the formation at large $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ of stagnant, perfectly conducting surface-charge caps about the drop poles.</description>

      <title>The effect of collision-coagulation on the mean relative velocity of particles in turbulent flow: systematic results and validation of model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean radial component of relative velocity (MRV) between pairs of inertial particles is studied, where the particles are advected by turbulent flow and undergo collision-and-coagulation. A previously proposed phenomenological model of MRV for low-inertia particles \citep{saw2022intricate} is corrected (improved) and shown to produce better predictions of the MRV as a function of particle separation distance $r$. Using direct numerical simulation (DNS), the relationship between the MRV and particle/turbulent parameters is studied. For particles with near-zero Stokes numbers ($St$), the MRV is roughly independent of $St$. At larger $St$, the magnitude of MRV increases with $St$, particularly when $St&gt;0.2$. Assuming that the relative particle velocities are derived from fluid velocity differences associated with a nominal resonant length scale, an empirical relation between $St$ is obtained: $d+\alpha St^{\beta}$, where $\beta\approx1.86$. Coupled with this empirical result, the aforementioned MRV model could be extended to predict MRV for any finite $St$, and we show that the predictions are accurate against the DNS results. Our results also suggest that the extended model could also accurately account for possible Reynolds number ($Re_{\lambda}$) effect by simply allowing $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to be functions of $Re_{\lambda}$. Additionally, when the particle diameter is smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale, the MRV for particles with the same St is independent of the particle diameter. The analysis under different Reynolds numbers ($Re_{\lambda}=84,124,189$) reveals that for particles with $St\ll1$, the MRV is $Re_{\lambda}$-independent. For larger $St$, $Re_{\lambda}$ dependence is observed such that the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ decrease with $Re_{\lambda}.</description>

      <title>Efficient aerodynamic coefficients prediction with a long sequence neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, deriving aerodynamic parameters for an airfoil via Computational Fluid Dynamics requires significant time and effort. However, recent approaches employ neural networks to replace this process, it still grapples with challenges like lack of end-to-end training and interpretability. A novel and more efficient neural network is proposed in this paper, called AirfoilNet. AirfoilNet seamlessly merges mathematical computations with neural networks, thereby augmenting interpretability. It encodes grey-scale airfoil images into a lower-dimensional space for computation with Reynolds number, angle of attack, and geometric coordinates of airfoils. The calculated features are then fed into prediction heads for aerodynamic coefficient predictions, and the entire process is end-to-end. Furthermore, two different prediction heads, Gated Recurrent Unit Net(GRUNet) and Residual Multi-Layer Perceptron(ResMLP), designed to support our iteratively refined prediction scheme. Comprehensive analysis of experimental results underscores AirfoilNet's robust prediction accuracy, generalization capability, and swift inference.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Lattice Boltzmann modeling of dense gas flows in curvilinear geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Enskog equation utilizing orthonormal vielbein fields, enabling the utilization of arbitrary coordinate systems to characterize spatial geometry. Additionally, we employ an adapted coordinate system in the momentum space, connected to the physical space through vielbeins. Within this framework, the momentum component perpendicular to a curved boundary can be treated as an independent one, facilitating the application of half-range Gauss-Hermite quadratures. We develop an appropriate finite-difference Lattice Boltzmann model and validate it against a DSMC-like particle-based method for solving the Enskog equation in curvilinear geometries. Our test scenarios include cylindrical Couette flow, cylindrical Fourier flow between coaxial cylinders, and spherical Fourier flow between concentric spheres. Excellent agreement between the two approaches is observed throughout the parameter range and curvature-specific effects are well captured.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation of a Spheroidal Particle in an Elastoviscoplastic Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sedimentation dynamics of a prolate spheroidal particle in an unbounded elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluid is studied by direct finite element simulations under inertialess flow conditions. The Saramito-Giesekus constitutive equation is employed to model the suspending liquid. The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation is used to handle the particle motion. The sedimentation, lift, and angular velocities of spheroids with aspect ratio between 1 and 8 are computed as the initial orientation, Bingham, and Weissenberg numbers are varied. Similarly to the purely viscoelastic case, a spheroid in an EVP fluid rotates up to align its major axis with the applied force. As the Bingham number increases, the settling rate monotonically reduces while the angular velocity first increases and then decreases. The initial orientation has a relevant effect on the particle stoppage because of the different drag experienced by the spheroid as its orientation is varied. The yielded and unyielded regions around the spheroid reveal that, for particle oriented transversely to the force, the yielded envelope shrinks near the tips due to the fast spatial decay of the stresses, and unyielded regions appear along the surface of the particle, similar to the solid caps observed at the front and back of a sphere. Fluid plasticity enhances the negative wake phenomenon that is observed at Weissenberg numbers significantly lower than the purely viscoelastic case. Results of the drag correction coefficient for particles aligned with longest axis along the force are presented.</description>

      <title>Why do hot and cold water sound different when poured?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical studies have demonstrated that humans possess the remarkable capacity to distinguish whether a glass of water is hot or cold solely by the sound of pouring it. However, the underlying physical mechanisms governing the disparities in the acoustic signatures of hot versus cold water remain to be deciphered. In this paper, we conducted a series of experiments to extract the intrinsic features of pouring sounds at contrasting temperatures. The results of our spectral analysis revealed that the sound of pouring hot water exhibited more pronounced low-frequency components and diminished high-frequency components relative to cold water. High-speed photographic evidence elucidated that pouring hot water could generate larger air bubbles in greater abundance. We conjecture that the Minnaert resonance arising from these larger entrained bubbles in hot water produces a lower-frequency acoustic signature, thereby constituting the foundational mechanistic explanation for the auditory distinction between pouring hot and cold water.</description>

      <title>A continuous data assimilation closure for modeling statistically steady turbulence in large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closure model is presented for large-eddy simulation (LES) based on the three-dimensional variational data assimilation algorithm. The approach aims at reconstructing high-fidelity kinetic energy spectra in coarse numerical simulations by including feedback control to represent unresolved dynamics interactions in the flow as stochastic processes. The forcing uses statistics obtained from off-line high-fidelity data and requires only few parameters compared to the number of degrees of freedom of LES. This modeling strategy is applied to geostrophic turbulence on the sphere. It proves to accurately recover the energy spectra, the interscale energy transfer and the zonal velocity profiles in the coarse model, for three generic situations.</description>

      <title>Vapor compression and energy dissipation in a collapsing laser-induced bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition of the gaseous phase of cavitation bubbles and its role on the collapse remains to date poorly understood. In this work, experiments of single cavitation bubbles in aqueous ammonia serve as a novel approach to investigate the effect of the vapor contained in a bubble on its collapse. We find that the higher vapor pressure of more concentrated aqueous ammonia acts as a resistance to the collapse, reducing the total energy dissipation. In line with visual observation, acoustic measurements, and luminescence recordings, it is also observed that higher vapor pressures contribute to a more spherical collapse, likely hindering the growth of interface instabilities by decreasing the collapse velocities and accelerations. Remarkably, we evidence a strong difference between the effective damping and the energy of the shock emission, suggesting that the latter is not the dominant dissipation mechanism at collapse as predicted from classical correction models accounting for slightly compressible liquids. Furthermore, our results suggest that the vapor inside collapsing bubbles gets compressed, consistently with previous studies performed in the context of single bubble sonoluminescence, addressing the question about the ability of vapors to readily condense during a bubble collapse in similar regimes. These findings provide insights into the identification of the influence of the bubble content and the energy exchanges of the bubble with its surrounding media, eventually paving the way to a more efficient use of cavitation in engineering and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>A fast immersed boundary method for an extruded wall geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational cost of the boundary-condition-enforced immersed boundary method (IBM) increases in the order of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ as the number of Lagrangian points, $N$, increases. This is due to the time-consuming calculation of the correction operator in the diffuse-interface IBM to enforce the no-slip boundary condition. In this study, a computationally efficient IBM algorithm for an extruded wall geometry is developed, and the correction operator calculation is significantly simplified while maintaining the accuracy of the solution. This method takes advantage of the geometrical symmetricity to apply several matrix simplifications, which result in a huge increase in the computational efficiency and an improved scalability of $\mathcal{O}(max(N, N^2/r^2))$ ($r$: the number of grid points towards the extruded direction). The boundary-condition-enforced IBM for an extruded wall geometry is applicable to the numerical simulations of the flow around a wall surface that satisfies both (a) an extruded wall geometry that retains the same cross-section geometry and (b) an Eulerian grid that is either uniform or whose stretch rate towards the extruded direction is constant. As this type of geometry is commonly studied to investigate the fundamental behavior of the fluid, the presented algorithm has wide applications. Several calculations are conducted to demonstrate the higher computational efficiency of the presented algorithm compared with that of the original algorithm. The results show improvements in computational efficiency of up to 2,800 times for the correction operator calculation and 160 times for the overall IBM calculations compared with the original algorithm while retaining the computational accuracy.</description>

      <title>Triboelectrically mediated self-assembly and manipulation of drops at an interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluid-fluid interface is a complex environment for a floating object where the statics and dynamics may be governed by capillarity, gravity, inertia, and other external body forces. Yet, the alignment of these forces in intricate ways might result in beautiful pattern formation and self-assembly of these objects, as in the case of bubble rafts or colloidal particles. While interfacial self-assembly has been explored widely, controlled manipulation of floating objects, e.g. drops, at the fluid-fluid interface still remains a challenge largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal the self-assembly and manipulation of water drops floating at an oil-air interface. We show that the assembly occurs due to electrostatic interactions between the drops and their environment. We highlight the role of the boundary surrounding the system by showing that even drops with a net zero electric charge can self-assemble under certain conditions. Using experiments and theory, we show that the depth of the oil bath plays an important role in setting the distance between the self-assembled drops. Furthermore, we demonstrate ways to manipulate the drops actively and passively at the interface.</description>
