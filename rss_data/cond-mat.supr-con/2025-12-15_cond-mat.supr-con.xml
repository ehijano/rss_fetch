      <title>Self-consistent inclusion of disorder in the BCS-BEC crossover near $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic theoretical approach to incorporate the effects of a static white-noise disorder into the BCS-BEC crossover near the critical temperature ($T_c$) of the superfluid transition. Starting from a functional-integral formulation in momentum-frequency space, we derive an effective thermodynamic potential that fully accounts for Gaussian fluctuations of the order-parameter field and its coupling to the disorder potential. The effective action, expanded to second order in both the disorder potential and the bosonic field, naturally involves third- and fourth-order terms arising from the logarithmic expansion near $T_c$. This formalism, valid across the entire BCS-BEC crossover, reproduces the well-established BCS and BEC limits and yields self-energy expressions consistent with previous analyses for non-interacting point bosons and tightly bound fermion pairs. The approach applies equally to continuum and lattice systems and provides a natural framework for generalizations to multiband models.</description>

      <title>Interplay between charge correlations and superconductivity across the superconducting domes of CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows an unconventional interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Tuning the band filling is known to rapidly suppress long-range CDW order and drive the formation of two superconducting ``domes" upon increasing hole concentration. Here we determine the detailed evolution of charge correlations across this phase diagram and resolve their interplay with the superconducting state. Upon light hole-doping, the suppression of a metastable $2\times 2\times 4$ CDW state coincides with the suppression of superconducting fluctuations present in the parent CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ compound. Continued doping suppresses long-range $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW order, leaving remnant short-range, quasi-1D correlations that persist across the second superconducting dome. These higher temperature charge correlations are seemingly essential to the lower temperature superconducting state, as charge correlations vanish coincident with superconductivity as a function of hole-doping. A multidomain model of short-range V-V dimer formation within the kagome plane is proposed in the second superconducting dome, where rotational and translational symmetry remain locally broken even in the absence of long-range CDW order.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature in Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 processed by the high gas-pressure and high-temperature synthesis method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 samples, CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4 with x values of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05, are synthesized using two distinct routes: conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas-pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. Comprehensive characterizations are performed on these samples to investigate their superconducting properties. This study examines the effects of Mn substitution at Fe sites in the FeAs layer on the superconducting properties of the CaKFe4As4 (1144) material. The HP-HTS process improves the microstructure and phase purity of the parent sample (x = 0), resulting in an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc). In contrast, Mn doping via the CSP method in CaKFe4As4 reduces the sample quality and superconducting performance. Notably, the high-pressure synthesis method leads to an increase in the Tc by 3 to 7 K, particularly at low Mn concentrations. While the critical current density (Jc) of the parent sample (x = 0) shows a significant enhancement under the applied magnetic fields, Jc decreases for Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 bulks. These results demonstrate that high-pressure synthesis is an effective approach to improve the superconducting properties of Mn-doped 1144 compounds.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Lifshitz transition in pressurized electron-doped cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the electronic structure of hole-doped cuprate superconductors is tunable through both chemical doping and external pressure, which frequently offer us new insights of understanding on the high-Tc superconducting mechanism. While, for electron-doped cuprate superconductors, although the chemical doping effects have been systematically and thoroughly investigated, there is still a notable lack of experimental evidence regarding the pressure-driven coevolution of Tc and electronic structure. In this study, we report the first observation on the signatures of pressure-induced Lifshitz transition in Pr0.87LaCe0.13CuO4+delta (PLCCO) single crystal, a typical electron-doped cuprate superconductor, through the comprehensive high-pressure measurements of electrical resistance, Hall coefficient (RH) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our results reveal that, at 40 K, the ambient-pressure RH with a significantly negative value decreases with increasing pressure until it reaches zero at a critical pressure (Pc ~ 10 GPa). Meanwhile, the corresponding Tc exhibits a slight variation within this pressure range. As pressure is further increased beyond Pc, RH changes its sign from negative to positive and then shows a slight increase, while Tc displays a continuous decrease. Our XRD measurements at 40 K demonstrate that no crystal structure phase transition occurs across the Pc. These results reveal that applying pressure to PLCCO can induce a Lifshitz transition at Pc, manifesting the reconstruction of the Fermi surface (FS), which turns the superconductivity toward fading out. Our calculation further reinforces the Fermi surface reconstruction from electron-dominated to hole-dominated ones at around Pc. These findings provide new evidence that highlights the strong correlation between the superconductivity and the Fermi surface topology in the electron-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity in Proximity to Peaks in Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the BCS theory of superconductivity, the electron-phonon interaction is transformed to an attractive electron-electron interaction in the vicinity of the Fermi energy only. At the same time, its formal derivation using a unitary transformation reveals that the electrons attract one another whenever their energies do not differ more than the phonon energy $\omega_\mathrm{D}$, independent of closeness to the Fermi energy. Consequently, the order parameter becomes finite even away from the Fermi level. Yet, for small interactions, its magnitude is usually small and can be safely ignored, justifying the BCS approximation. Intriguingly, we find that an accumulation of density-of-states at an energy $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$ in proximity to the Fermi energy induces a significant order parameter magnitude around $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$, which exceeds the one at $E_\mathrm{F}$ for moderate coupling strengths. This strong enhancement is heralded by the softening of an additional collective mode, which resembles a second phase transition. We predict measurable signatures in the thermodynamic and spectroscopic response of this unexpected phenomenon, guiding future experimental searches for it.</description>

      <title>High magnetic field response of superconductivity dome in quantum artificial High Tc superlattices with variable geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that cuprate artificial high temperature superlattices (AHTS) with period d, composed of quantum wells confining interface space charge in stoichiometric Mott insulator layers (S), with thickness L, at the interface with overdoped normal metallic cuprate layers (N) show a superconducting dome by tuning the geometric L over d ratio of the SNSN superlattice with the top predicted by quantum material design engineering quantum size effects. Here we report high-field magneto transport measurements up to 41 Tesla of AHTS across the entire superconducting dome. The results show the universal upward-concave behavior of the temperature dependent upper critical magnetic field in low critical temperature samples at rising edge and drop edge of the dome providing compelling evidence for two-band superconductivity in agreement with multigap theory used for quantum design of the SNSN superlattices. The measured superconducting coherence length demonstrates that atomic-scale engineering controls not only the critical temperature but also the intrinsic pair size at Fano-Feshbach resonances physics paving the way toward next generation quantum devices and shedding light on unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dissipation due to bulk localized low-energy modes in strongly disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the temperature $T$ and frequency $\omega$ dependence of ac dissipation in strongly disordered superconductors featuring a pseudogap $\Delta_{P}$ in the single-particle spectrum. Our theory applies to the regime $T,\,\hbar\omega\ll\Delta_{\text{typ}}\ll\Delta_{P}$, where $\Delta_{\text{typ}}$ is the typical superconducting gap. The dissipation is expressed in terms of the quality factor $Q(T,\omega)$ of microwave resonators made of these materials. We show that low-$\omega$ dissipation is dominated by a new type of bulk localized collective modes. Due to the strongly nonuniform spectral density of these modes, $Q$ decreases sharply with frequency, while its temperature dependence exhibits a two-level-system-like growth as a function of $T$ for $T\ll T_{c}$. Our theory is applicable to InO$_x$, TiN, NbN, and similar strongly disordered materials. We further argue that the experimentally observed behavior of disordered films of granular Aluminum is explained by similar physics, although this case requires a separate theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the vortex pinning potential in superconducting films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of the vortex pinning potential in a thin superconducting film. Modeling intrinsic inhomogeneities by a random-temperature Ginzburg-Landau functional with short-range Gaussian disorder, we derive the pinning landscape $E(\mathbf{R})$ by determining how the vortex core adapts to randomness. Within the hard-core approximation, applicable for weak disorder, the energy landscape exhibits Gaussian statistics. In this regime, the mean areal density of its minima is given by $n_\text{min}\approx(6\xi)^{-2}$, indicating that the typical spacing between neighboring minima is significantly larger than the vortex core size $\xi$. Going beyond the hard-core approximation, we allow the vortex order parameter to relax in response to the inhomogeneities. As a result, the pinning potential statistics become non-Gaussian. We calculate the leading correction due to the core deformation, which reduces the density of minima with a relative magnitude scaling as $(T_c-T)^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci sequence of twist angles in superconducting multi-layer graphene and hydrogenated graphitic fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A range of twist angles between adjacent surfaces/volumes are intrinsic to natural graphite or artificially design in multi-layer graphene. In addition, stacking faults can be created by the application of mechanic, electric or magnetic fields. Charge and spin transport then occur in relation to the existing twist-angle pattern. In two dimensions, a saddle point in the electronic band structure leads to divergence in the density of states, known as van Hove singularities (vHs). The energy difference between vHs for the conduction and valence bands was found to increase with the twist angle between neighboring graphite domains with respect to the c axis (perpendicular to the graphite planes). In this work, we estimate for the superconducting (SC)-like nano-size multi-layer granular domain in hydrogenated graphitic fibers [1]. We show that this value for and the values found by others for few-layer graphene might actually form the Fibonacci mathematical sequence. Moreover, SC hydrogenated graphite can harbour higher-order topology as reflected in at least quadratic energy gap flattening. Charge transport and magnetization measurements on hydrogenated graphitic fibers have been done using a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field induced momentum-dependent symmetry breaking in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ revealed by magneto-ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum materials with multiple degrees of freedom with similar energy scales, intertwined electronic orders with distinct broken symmetries often appear in a strongly coupled fashion. Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of plasmons in three-dimensional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the plasma branch of an homogeneous three-dimensional electron gas in an $s$-wave superconducting state. We focus on the regime where the plasma frequency $\omega_p$ is comparable to the gap $\Delta$, which is experimentally realized in cuprates. Although a sum rule guarantees that the departure of the plasma branch always coincides with the plasma frequency, the dispersion and lifetime of the plasmons is strongly affected by the presence of the pair condensate, especially at energies close to the pair-breaking threshold $2\Delta$. When $\omega_p $ is above $1.7\Delta $, the level repulsion is strong enough to give the plasma branch an anomalous, negative dispersion with a minimum at finite wavelength. At non-zero temperature and at $\omega_p&gt;2\Delta$, we treat in a non-perturbative way the coupling of plasmons to the fermionic excitations, and show that a broadened plasma resonance inside the pair-breaking continuum coexists with an undamped solution in the band gap. This resonance splitting is associated with the presence of multiple poles in the analytic continuation of the propagator of the Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Indirect Tunneling Enabled Spontaneous Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking and Josephson Diode Effect in TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_2$/Nb tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.</description>

      <title>Plasmon excitations and their attenuation in dirty superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$ to the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with weakly $T$-dependent $\omega[q_c(T)] \approx 2\Delta(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</description>
