      <title>Recycling failed photoelectrons via tertiary photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key insight of Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect is that a minimum energy is required for photoexcited electrons to escape from a material. For the past century it has been assumed that photoexcited electrons of lower energies make no contribution to the photoemission spectrum. Here we demonstrate the conceptual possibility that the energy of these 'failed' photoelectrons-primary or secondary-can be partially recycled to generate new 'tertiary' electrons of energy sufficient to escape. Such a 'recycling' step goes beyond the traditional three steps of the photoemission process (excitation, transport, and escape), and, as we illustrate, it can be realized through a novel Auger mechanism that involves three distinct minority electronic states in the material. We develop a phenomenological three-band model to treat this mechanism within a revised four-step framework for photoemission, which contains robust features of linewidth narrowing and population inversion under strong excitation, reminiscent of the lasing phenomena. We show that the conditions for this recycling mechanism are likely satisfied in many quantum materials with multiple flat bands properly located away from the Fermi level, and elaborate on the representative case of SrTiO3 among other promising candidates. We further discuss how this mechanism can explain the recent observation of anomalous intense coherent photoemission from a SrTiO3 surface, and predict its manifestations in related experiments, including the 'forbidden' case of photoemission with photon energies lower than the work function. Our study calls for paradigm shifts across a range of fundamental and applied research fields, especially in the areas of photoemission, photocathodes, and flat-band materials.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities in the order parameter space that are mathematically described by topological invariants and cannot be removed by continuous transformations. These defects play a significant role in various fields, ranging from cosmology to solid-state physics and biological matter. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, leading to decades of debate about the existence of topological defects in disordered systems, such as glasses. Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects might emerge in the dynamical properties of glasses under deformation, potentially relating to their plastic behavior. In this study, we investigate a two-dimensional colloidal glass system composed of particles interacting by an effective magnetic repulsion. We reveal the presence of topological defects in the eigenspace of the vibrational frequencies of this experimental 2D amorphous solid. The vibrational density of states of this 2D amorphous material exhibits distinct glassy properties such as the presence of a boson peak anomaly. Through extensive numerical and theoretical quantitative analysis, we establish a robust positive correlation between the vibrational characteristics and the total number of topological defects. We furthermore show that defects of opposite charge tend to pair together and prove their local statistical correlation with the "soft spots", the regions more prone to plastic flow. This work provides the experimental confirmation for the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing a complex interplay between topology, disorder, and vibrational behavior.</description>

      <title>Soft Phonon Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of condensed matter systems describe gapless modes that can be interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken Poincar\'e symmetry. In this paper we derive new soft theorems constraining the tree-level scattering of these degrees of freedom, as exhibited in solids, fluids, superfluids, and framids. These soft theorems are in one-to-one correspondence with various broken symmetries, including spacetime translations, Lorentz boosts, and, for the case of fluids, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. We also implement a bootstrap in which the enhanced vanishing of amplitudes in the soft limit is taken as an input, thus sculpting out a subclass of exceptional solid, fluid, and framid theories.</description>

      <title>Damping Reveals Hidden Dimensions in Elastic Metastructures Through Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Damping typically results in attenuation of vibrations and elastic wave propagation in mechanical systems. Contrary to this conventional understanding, we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically the revival of an elastic wave transmitted through a periodic metastructure when a weak non-Hermitian defect (damping mechanism) induces violation of time-reversal symmetry. Damping alters the nature of the system's resonant modes, instigating interference in the scattering field. This leads to transmission revival, revealing the presence of hidden modes which are otherwise masked by the symmetry. Our findings offer an innovative approach for designing dissipation-driven switches and controllers and non-destructive structural health monitoring systems.</description>
