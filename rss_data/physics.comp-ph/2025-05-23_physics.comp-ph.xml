      <title>A broken-FEEC framework for structure-preserving discretizations of polar domains with tensor-product splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel projection-based approach to derive structure-preserving Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) discretizations using standard tensor-product splines on domains with a polar singularity. This approach follows the main lines of broken-FEEC schemes which define stable and structure-preserving operators in non-conforming discretizations of the de Rham sequence. Here, we devise a polar broken-FEEC framework that enables the use of standard tensor-product spline spaces while ensuring stability and smoothness for the solutions, as well as the preservation of the de Rham structure: A benefit of this approach is the ability to reuse codes that implement standard splines on smooth parametric domains, and efficient solvers such as Kronecker-product spline interpolation. Our construction is based on two pillars: the first one is an explicit characterization of smooth polar spline spaces within the tensor-product splines ones, which are either discontinuous or non square-integrable as a result of the singular polar pushforward operators. The second pillar consists of local, explicit and matrix-free conforming projection operators that map general tensor-product splines onto smooth polar splines, and that commute with the differential operators of the de Rham sequence.</description>

      <title>A finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model that accurately captures multicomponent ionic transport by incorporating key physical phenomena such as steric effects, solvation, and pressure coupling. The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences.</description>

      <title>A collaborative constrained graph diffusion model for the generation of realistic synthetic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing new molecular compounds is crucial to address pressing challenges, from health to environmental sustainability. However, exploring the molecular space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space. Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters. Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.</description>

      <title>Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Higher order Jacobi method for solving a system of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a higher-order iterative framework for solving matrix equations, inspired by the structure and functionality of neural networks. A modification of the classical Jacobi method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher-order Jacobi method, structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that, once the network parameters are determined for a known system, enables efficient resolution of system variations without re-computing the coefficients. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach moves beyond conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis demonstrates improved order of complexity, suggesting a promising direction for algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.</description>

      <title>Spin adaptation of the cumulant expansions of reduced density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for the spin adaptation of the cumulants of p-particle reduced density matrices (RDMs), with explicit constructions for p = 1 to 3. These spin-adapted cumulants enable rigorous treatment of both S_z and S^2 symmetries in quantum systems, providing a foundation for spin-resolved electronic structure methods. We show that complete spin adaptation -- referred to as complete S-representability -- can be enforced by constraining the variances of S_z and S^2, which require the 2-RDM and 4-RDM, respectively. Importantly, the cumulants of RDMs scale linearly with system size -- size-extensive -- making them a natural object for incorporating spin symmetries in scalable electronic structure theories. The developed formalism is applicable to density-based methods (DFT), one-particle RDM functional theories (RDMFT), and two-particle RDM methods. We further extend the approach to spin-orbit-coupled systems via total angular momentum adaptation. Beyond spin, the framework enables the adaptation of RDM theories to additional symmetries through the construction of suitable irreducible tensor operators.</description>

      <title>PICT -- A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Multi-Block PISO Solver for Simulation-Coupled Learning Tasks in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</description>

      <title>SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</description>

      <title>Vibrational ADAPT-VQE: Critical points leads to problematic convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is one of the most promising applications for which quantum computing is expected to have significant impact. Despite considerable research in the field of electronic structure, calculating the vibrational properties of molecules on quantum computers remain a relatively unexplored field. In this work, we develop a vibrational ADAPT-VQE (vADAPT-VQE) formalism based on an infinite product representation (IPR) of anti-Hermitian excitation operators of the Full Vibrational Configuration Interaction (FVCI) wavefunction which allows for preparing eigenstates of vibrational Hamiltonians on quantum computers. In order to establish the vADAPT- VQE algorithm using the IPR, we study the exactness of disentangled Unitary Vibrational Coupled Cluster (dUVCC) theory and show that dUVCC can formally represent the FVCI wavefunction in an infinite expansion. To investigate the performance of the vADAPT-VQE algorithm, we numerically study whether the vADAPT-VQE algorithm generates a sequence of operators which may represent the FVCI wavefunction. Our numerical results indicate frequent appearance of critical points in the wavefunction preparation using vADAPT-VQE. These results imply that one may encounter diminishing usefulness when preparing vibrational wavefunctions on quantum computers using vADAPT-VQE and that additional studies are required to find methods that can circumvent this behavior.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamic Network Model of the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes to model the space environment as a stochastic dynamic network where each node is a group of objects of a given class, or species, and their relationship is represented by stochastic links. A set of stochastic dynamic equations, governing the evolution of the network, are derived from the network structure and topology. It will be shown that the proposed system of stochastic dynamic equations well reproduces existing results on the evolution of the space environment. The analysis of the structure of the network and relationships among node can help to understand which species of objects and orbit regimes are more critical and affect the most the future evolution of the space environment. In analogy with ecological networks, we develop a theory of the carrying capacity of space based on the stability of equilibria of the network dynamics. Some examples are presented starting from the current population of resident objects and different launch traffic forecast models. It will be shown how the proposed network model can be used to study the effect of the adoption of different policies on the execution of collision avoidance and post mission disposal manoeuvres.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum state diagonalization with computational-basis probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we propose a novel quantum diagonalization algorithm based on the optimization of variational quantum circuits. Diagonalizing a quantum state is a fundamental yet computationally challenging task in quantum information science, especially as the system size increases. To address this challenge, we reformulate the problem as a variational optimization process, where parameterized quantum circuits are trained to transform the input state into a diagonal form. To guide the optimization, we develop two objective functions based on measurement outcomes in the computational basis. The first objective function utilizes global computational basis probabilities, with the optimized value directly yielding the purity of the input state. The second objective function, designed for enhanced experimental feasibility, is constructed solely from single-qubit probabilities. It admits an elegant and compact analytical form that significantly reduces the exponential measurement complexity, while still effectively driving the state toward a diagonal representation. Through numerical simulations and analytical insights, we demonstrate that our variational optimization framework successfully produces the diagonal form of an input quantum state, offering a scalable and practical solution for quantum state diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Scalable Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction through Adaptive Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost--driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations--restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network, that incorporates adaptive SParsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70%. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact.
