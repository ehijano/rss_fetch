      <title>Phase transition in a kinetic mean-field game model of inertial self-propelled agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of Mean-field Games (MFGs) is used for modelling the collective dynamics of large populations of non-cooperative decision-making agents. We formulate and analyze a kinetic MFG model for an interacting system of non-cooperative motile agents with inertial dynamics and finite-range interactions, where each agent is minimizing a biologically inspired cost function. By analyzing the associated coupled forward-backward in time system of nonlinear Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, we obtain conditions for closed-loop linear stability of the spatially homogeneous MFG equilibrium that corresponds to an ordered state with non-zero mean speed. Using a combination of analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when energetic cost of control is reduced below a critical value, this equilibrium loses stability, and the system transitions to a travelling wave solution. Our work provides a game-theoretic perspective to the problem of collective motion in non-equilibrium biological and bio-inspired systems.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg games with the third party</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the third party to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium with the time inconsistency in three different Stackelberg games, which are the discrete-time games, the dynamic games, and the mean field games. Here all followers are experiencing learning-by-doing. The role of a third party is similar to industry associations, they supervise the leader's implementation and impose penalties for the defection with the discount factor. Then we obtain different forms of discount factors in different models and effective conditions to prevent defection.These results are consistent and the third party intervention is effective and maneuverable in practice.</description>

      <title>Convergence of machine learning methods for feedback control laws: averaged feedback learning scheme and data driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the synthesis of optimal feedback control laws via machine learning. In particular, the Averaged Feedback Learning Scheme (AFLS) and a data driven method are considered. Hypotheses for each method ensuring the convergence of the evaluation of the objective function of the underlying control problem at the obtained feedback-laws towards the optimal value function are provided. These hypotheses are connected to the regularity of the value function and the stability of the dynamics. In the case of AFLS these hypotheses only require H\"older continuity of the value function, whereas for the data driven method the value function must be at least $C^2$. It is demonstrated that these methods are connected via their optimality conditions. Additionally, numerical experiments are provided by applying both methods to a family control problems, parameterized by a positive real number which controls the regularity of the value function. For small parameters the value function is smooth and in contrast for large parameters it is non-differentiable, but semi-concave. The results of the experiments indicate that both methods have a similar performance for the case that the value function is smooth. On the other hand, if the value function is not differentiable, AFLS has a better performance which is consistent with the obtained convergence results.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotic Analysis of Perturbed Sweeping Processes with Application to Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence analysis of constrained optimization methods from the dynamical systems viewpoint has attracted considerable attention because it provides a geometric demonstration towards the shadowing trajectory of a numerical scheme. In this work, we establish a tight connection between a continuous-time nonsmooth dynamical system called a perturbed sweeping process (PSP) and a proximal stochastic approximation scheme. Theoretical results are obtained by analyzing the asymptotic pseudo trajectory of a PSP. We show that under mild assumptions a proximal stochastic approximation scheme converges to an internally chain transitive invariant set of the corresponding PSP. Furthermore, given the existence of a Lyapunov function $V$ with respect to a set $\Lambda$, convergence to $\Lambda$ can be established if $V(\Lambda)$ has an empty interior. Based on these theoretical results, we are able to provide a useful framework for convergence analysis of proximal gradient methods. Illustrative examples are provided to determine the convergence of proximal variants of gradient methods (including accelerated gradient methods). Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the validity of theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Constructing Electricity Market Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This working paper presents a comprehensive study on the development and analysis of various electricity market models, focusing on continuous, discrete, and fractional-order approaches. The continuous model captures the ongoing interactions between power producers and consumers using differential equations, providing insights into long-term trends and steady-state behaviors. The discrete model, suitable for analyzing scenarios where market events occur at specific time intervals, incorporates memory effects to account for historical behaviors and decisions, offering a realistic representation of short-term market dynamics. The fractional-order model introduces fractional calculus to capture memory effects and hereditary properties, enhancing the model's realism and predictive capability by reflecting the influence of past states on current market behavior.</description>

      <title>Outer Approximation and Super-modular Cuts for Constrained Assortment Optimization under Mixed-Logit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the assortment optimization problem under the mixed-logit customer choice model. While assortment optimization has been a major topic in revenue management for decades, the mixed-logit model is considered one of the most general and flexible approaches for modeling and predicting customer purchasing behavior. Existing exact methods have primarily relied on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) or second-order cone (CONIC) reformulations, which allow for exact problem solving using off-the-shelf solvers. However, these approaches often suffer from weak continuous relaxations and are slow when solving large instances. Our work addresses the problem by focusing on components of the objective function that can be proven to be monotonically super-modular and convex. This allows us to derive valid cuts to outer-approximate the nonlinear objective functions. We then demonstrate that these valid cuts can be incorporated into Cutting Plane or Branch-and-Cut methods to solve the problem exactly. Extensive experiments show that our approaches consistently outperform previous methods in terms of both solution quality and computation time.</description>

      <title>Variational Analysis of Generalized Games over Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalized games defined over Banach spaces using variational analysis. To reformulate generalized games as quasi-variational inequality problems, we will first form a suitable principal operator and study some significant properties of this operator. Then, we deduce the sufficient conditions under which an equilibrium for the generalized game can be obtained by solving a quasi-variational inequality. Based on this variational reformulation, we derive the existence of equilibrium for generalized games with non-ordered (that is, associated weak preference relations need not be complete and transitive) and mid-point continuous preference maps.</description>

      <title>Tracking controllability for finite-dimensional linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze the concept of tracking controllability, where the objective is for the state of a control system, or some projection thereof, to follow a given trajectory within a specified time horizon. By leveraging duality, we characterize tracking controllability through a non-standard observability inequality for the adjoint system. This characterization facilitates the development of a systematic approach for constructing controls with minimal norm. However, achieving such an observability property is challenging. To address this, we utilize the classical Brunovsk\'y canonical form for control systems, specifically focusing on the case of scalar controls. Our findings reveal that tracking control inherently involves a loss of regularity in the controls. This phenomenon is highly sensitive to the system's structure and the interaction between the projection to be tracked and the system.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov Analysis of Accelerated PDHG Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Lasso is a remarkably versatile and extensively utilized model across a broad spectrum of domains, including statistics, machine learning, and image science. Among the optimization techniques employed to address the challenges posed by this model, saddle-point methods stand out for their effectiveness. In particular, the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm has emerged as a highly popular choice, celebrated for its robustness and efficiency in finding optimal solutions. Recently, the underlying mechanism of the PDHG algorithm has been elucidated through the high-resolution ordinary differential equation (ODE) and the implicit-Euler scheme as detailed in [Li and Shi, 2024a]. This insight has spurred the development of several accelerated variants of the PDHG algorithm, originally proposed by [Chambolle and Pock, 2011]. By employing discrete Lyapunov analysis, we establish that the PDHG algorithm with iteration-varying step sizes, converges at a rate near $O(1/k^2)$. Furthermore, for the specific setting where $\tau_{k+1}\sigma_k = s^2$ and $\theta_k = \tau_{k+1}/\tau_k \in (0, 1)$ as proposed in [Chambolle and Pock, 2011], an even faster convergence rate of $O(1/k^2)$ can be achieved. To substantiate these findings, we design a novel discrete Lyapunov function. This function is distinguished by its succinctness and straightforwardness, providing a clear and elegant proof of the enhanced convergence properties of the PDHG algorithm under the specified conditions. Finally, we utilize the discrete Lyapunov function to establish the optimal linear convergence rate when both the objective functions are strongly convex.</description>

      <title>Immunity to Increasing Condition Numbers of Linear Superiorization versus Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family of linear constraints and a linear objective function one can consider whether to apply a Linear Programming (LP) algorithm or use a Linear Superiorization (LinSup) algorithm on this data. In the LP methodology one aims at finding a point that fulfills the constraints and has the minimal value of the objective function over these constraints. The Linear Superiorization approach considers the same data as linear programming problems but instead of attempting to solve those with linear optimization methods it employs perturbation resilient feasibility-seeking algorithms and steers them toward feasible points with reduced (not necessarily minimal) objective function values. Previous studies compared LP and LinSup in terms of their respective outputs and the resources they use. In this paper we investigate these two approaches in terms of their sensitivity to condition numbers of the system of linear constraints. Condition numbers are a measure for the impact of deviations in the input data on the output of a problem and, in particular, they describe the factor of error propagation when given wrong or erroneous data. Therefore, the ability of LP and LinSup to cope with increased condition numbers, thus with ill-posed problems, is an important matter to consider which was not studied until now. We investigate experimentally the advantages and disadvantages of both LP and LinSup on examplary problems of linear programming with multiple condition numbers and different problem dimensions.</description>

      <title>Strong chain control sets and affine control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For control-affine systems on non-compact manifolds, the notion of strong chain control sets is introduced and related to the strong chain transitivity of the associated control flows. Affine control systems on R^n are embedded into bilinear control systems in an extended state space and it is shown that they are topologically conjugate to the induced system on the northern hemisphere of the Poincar\'e sphere. This preserves strong chain control sets. Further chain controllability properties on spheres are analyzed</description>

      <title>Numerical Discretization Methods for the Discounted Linear Quadratic Control Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the numerical discretization methods for the continuous-time discounted linear-quadratic optimal control problem (LQ-OCP) with time delays. By assuming piecewise constant inputs, we formulate the discrete system matrices of the discounted LQ-OCPs into systems of differential equations. Subsequently, we derive the discrete-time equivalent of the discounted LQ-OCP by solving these systems. This paper presents three numerical methods for solving the proposed differential equations systems: the fixed-time-step ordinary differential equation (ODE) method, the step-doubling method, and the matrix exponential method. Our numerical experiment demonstrates that all three methods accurately solve the differential equation systems. Interestingly, the step-doubling method emerges as the fastest among them while maintaining the same level of accuracy as the fixed-time-step ODE method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control on Positive Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal control problem on finite-dimensional positive cones is stated. Under a critical assumption on the cone, the corresponding Bellman equation is satisfied by a linear function, which can be computed by convex optimization. A separate theorem relates the assumption on the cone to the existence of minimal elements in certain subsets of the dual cone. Three special cases are derived as examples. The first one, where the positive cone is the set of positive semi-definite matrices, reduces to standard linear quadratic control. The second one, where the positive cone is a polyhedron, reduces to a recent result on optimal control of positive systems. The third special case corresponds to linear quadratic control with additional structure, such as spatial invariance.</description>

      <title>Numerical Discrete-Time Implementation of Continuous-Time Linear-Quadratic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the design, discretization and implementation of the continuous-time linear-quadratic model predictive control (CT-LMPC). The control model of the CT-LMPC is parameterized as transfer functions with time delays, and they are separated into deterministic and stochastic parts for relevant control and filtering algorithms. We formulate time-delay, finite-horizon CT linear-quadratic optimal control problems (LQ-OCPs) for the CT-LMPC. By assuming piece-wise constant inputs and constraints, we present the numerical discretization of the proposed LQ-OCPs and show how to convert the discrete-time (DT) equivalent into a standard quadratic program. The performance of the CT-LMPC is compared with the conventional DT-LMPC algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that, under fixed tunning parameters, the CT-LMPC shows better closed-loop performance as the sampling time increases than the conventional DT-LMPC.</description>

      <title>Behaviors, trajectories and data: A novel perspective on the design of unknown-input observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel perspective, based on Willems' "behavior theory", on the design of an unknown-input observer for a given linear time-invariant discrete-time state-space model, with unknown disturbances affecting both the state and the output equations. The problem is first addressed assuming that the original system model is known, and later assuming that the model is unknown but historical data satisfying a certain assumption are available. In both cases, fundamental concepts in behavior theory, as the projection of a behavior, the inclusion of a behavior in another one, and the use of kernel and image representations, provide quite powerful tools to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an unknown-input observer (UIO), as well as algorithms to design one of them, if it exists.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Kalman Filtering over Finite and Infinite Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distributionally robust filtering of signals generated by state-space models driven by exogenous disturbances with noisy observations in finite and infinite horizon scenarios. The exact joint probability distribution of the disturbances and noise is unknown but assumed to reside within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity ball centered around a given nominal distribution. We aim to derive a causal estimator that minimizes the worst-case mean squared estimation error among all possible distributions within this ambiguity set. We remove the iid restriction in prior works by permitting arbitrarily time-correlated disturbances and noises. In the finite horizon setting, we reduce this problem to a semi-definite program (SDP), with computational complexity scaling with the time horizon. For infinite horizon settings, we characterize the optimal estimator using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Although the optimal estimator lacks a rational form, i.e., a finite-dimensional state-space realization, it can be fully described by a finite-dimensional parameter. {Leveraging this parametrization, we propose efficient algorithms that compute the optimal estimator with arbitrary fidelity in the frequency domain.} Moreover, given any finite degree, we provide an efficient convex optimization algorithm that finds the finite-dimensional state-space estimator that best approximates the optimal non-rational filter in ${\cal H}_\infty$ norm. This facilitates the practical implementation of the infinite horizon filter without having to grapple with the ill-scaled SDP from finite time. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>ESDIRK-based nonlinear model predictive control for stochastic differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm for systems modeled by semi-explicit stochastic differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of index 1. The NMPC combines a continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter (CD-EKF) with an optimal control problem (OCP) for setpoint tracking. We discretize the OCP using direct multiple shooting. We apply an explicit singly diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) integration scheme to solve systems of DAEs, both for the one-step prediction in the CD-EKF and in each shooting interval of the discretized OCP. The ESDIRK methods use an iterated internal numerical differentiation approach for precise sensitivity computations. These sensitivities are used to provide accurate gradient information in the OCP and to efficiently integrate the covariance information in the CD-EKF. Subsequently, we present a simulation case study where we apply the NMPC to a simple alkaline electrolyzer stack model. We use the NMPC to track a time-varying setpoint for the stack temperature subject to input bound constraints.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Method for Lipschitz Stability of General LASSO-type Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a decomposition-based method to investigate the Lipschitz stability of solution mappings for general LASSO-type problems with convex data fidelity and $\ell_1$-regularization terms. The solution mappings are considered as set-valued mappings of the measurement vector and the regularization parameter. Based on the proposed method, we provide two regularity conditions for Lipschitz stability: the weak and strong conditions. The weak condition implies the Lipschitz continuity of solution mapping at the point in question, regardless of solution uniqueness. The strong condition yields the local single-valued and Lipschitz continuity of solution mapping. When applied to the LASSO and Square Root LASSO (SR-LASSO), the weak condition is new, while the strong condition is equivalent to some sufficient conditions for Lipschitz stability found in the literature. Specifically, our results reveal that the solution mapping of the LASSO is globally (Hausdorff) Lipschitz continuous without any assumptions. In contrast, the solution mapping of the SR-LASSO is not always Lipschitz continuous. A sufficient and necessary condition is proposed for its local Lipschitz property. Furthermore, we fully characterize the local single-valued and Lipschitz continuity of solution mappings for both problems using the strong condition.</description>

      <title>FADAS: Towards Federated Adaptive Asynchronous Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted training paradigm for privacy-preserving machine learning. While the SGD-based FL algorithms have demonstrated considerable success in the past, there is a growing trend towards adopting adaptive federated optimization methods, particularly for training large-scale models. However, the conventional synchronous aggregation design poses a significant challenge to the practical deployment of those adaptive federated optimization methods, particularly in the presence of straggler clients. To fill this research gap, this paper introduces federated adaptive asynchronous optimization, named FADAS, a novel method that incorporates asynchronous updates into adaptive federated optimization with provable guarantees. To further enhance the efficiency and resilience of our proposed method in scenarios with significant asynchronous delays, we also extend FADAS with a delay-adaptive learning adjustment strategy. We rigorously establish the convergence rate of the proposed algorithms and empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of FADAS over other asynchronous FL baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive proof concerning the regularity of critical points for the spline energy functional on Riemannian manifolds, even for the general higher-order case. Although this result is widely acknowledged in the literature, a detailed proof was previously absent. Our proof relies on a generalization of the DuBois-Reymond Lemma. Furthermore, we establish the existence of minimizers for the spline energy functional in cases where multiple interpolation points are prescribed alongside just one velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal control of mean-field systems with heterogeneous and asymmetric interactions. This leads to considering a family of controlled Brownian diffusion processes with dynamics depending on the whole collection of marginal probability laws. We prove the well-posedness of such systems and define the control problem together with its related value function. We next prove a law invariance property for the value function which allows us to work on the set of collections of probability laws. We show that the value function satisfies a dynamic programming principle (DPP) on the flow of collections of probability measures. We also derive a chain rule for a class of regular functions along the flows of collections of marginal laws of diffusion processes. Combining the DPP and the chain rule, we prove that the value function is a viscosity solution of a Bellman dynamic programming equation in a $L^2$-set of Wasserstein space-valued functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.01817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ridepooling services require efficient optimization algorithms to simultaneously plan routes and pool users in shared rides. We consider a static dial-a-ride problem (DARP) where a series of origin-destination requests have to be assigned to routes of a fleet of vehicles. Thereby, all requests have associated time windows for pick-up and delivery, and may be denied if they can not be serviced in reasonable time or at reasonable cost. Rather than using a spatial representation of the transportation network we suggest an event-based formulation of the problem, resulting in significantly improved computational times. While the corresponding MILP formulations require more variables than standard models, they have the advantage that capacity, pairing and precedence constraints are handled implicitly. The approach is tested and validated using a standard IP-solver on benchmark data from the literature. Moreover, the impact of, and the trade-off between, different optimization goals is evaluated on a case study in the city of Wuppertal (Germany).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasi-variational inequalities play a significant role in analyzing a wide range of real-world problems. However, these problems are more complicated to solve than variational inequalities as the constraint set is based on the current point. We study a class of quasi-variational inequality problems whose specific structure is beneficial in finding some of its solutions by solving a corresponding variational inequality problem. Based on the classical existence theorem for variational inequalities, our main results ensure the occurrence of solutions for the aforementioned class of quasi-variational inequalities in which the associated constraint maps are (possibly) unbounded. We employ a coercivity condition which plays a crucial role in obtaining these results. Finally, we apply our existence results to ensure the occurrence of equilibrium for the pure exchange economic problems and the jointly convex generalized Nash games.</description>

      <title>Data-driven mode detection and stabilization of unknown switched linear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the stabilization of unknown switched linear systems using data. Instead of a full system model, we have access to a finite number of trajectories of each of the different modes prior to the online operation of the system. On the basis of informative enough measurements, formally characterized in terms of linear matrix inequalities, we design an online switched controller that alternates between a mode detection phase and a stabilization phase. Since the specific currently-active mode is unknown, the controller employs the most recent online measurements to determine it by implementing computationally efficient tests that check compatibility with the set of systems consistent with the pre-collected measurements. The stabilization phase applies the stabilizing feedback gain corresponding to the identified active mode and monitors the evolution of the associated Lyapunov function to detect switches. When a switch is detected, the controller returns to the mode-detection phase. Under average dwell- and activation-time assumptions on the switching signal, we show that the proposed controller guarantees a practical stability property of the closed-loop switched system. Various simulations illustrate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of accurately determining guaranteed suboptimal values of an unknown cost function on the basis of noisy measurements. We consider a set-valued variant to regression where, instead of finding a best estimate of the cost function, we reason over all functions compatible with the measurements and apply robust methods explicitly in terms of the data. Our treatment provides data-based conditions under which closed-forms expressions of upper bounds of the unknown function can be obtained, and regularity properties like convexity and Lipschitzness can be established. These results allow us to provide tests for point- and set-wise verification of suboptimality, and tackle the cautious optimization of the unknown function in both one-shot and online scenarios. We showcase the versatility of the proposed methods in two control-relevant problems: data-driven contraction analysis of unknown nonlinear systems and suboptimal regulation with unknown dynamics and cost. Simulations illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Robust Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic model predictive control (MPC), while powerful, is often insufficient for effectively controlling autonomous systems in the real-world. Factors such as environmental noise and model error can cause deviations from the expected nominal performance. Robust MPC algorithms aim to bridge this gap between deterministic and uncertain control. However, these methods are often excessively difficult to tune for robustness due to the nonlinear and non-intuitive effects that controller parameters have on performance. To address this challenge, we first present a unifying perspective on differentiable optimization for control using the implicit function theorem (IFT), from which existing state-of-the art methods can be derived. Drawing parallels with differential dynamic programming, the IFT enables the derivation of an efficient differentiable optimal control framework. The derived scheme is subsequently paired with a tube-based MPC architecture to facilitate the automatic and real-time tuning of robust controllers in the presence of large uncertainties and disturbances. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked on multiple nonlinear robotic systems, including two systems in the MuJoCo simulator environment and one hardware experiment on the Robotarium testbed, to demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel data-driven constraint screening approach aimed at accelerating the solution of convexified AC optimal power flow (C-OPF) by eliminating non-binding constraints. Our constraint screening process leverages a novel mixture-of-experts architecture called MoGE (Mixture of Gradient Experts), which is trained to predict optimal dual variables based on problem parameters. The results demonstrate that subject to certain mild conditions on the C-OPF model, our proposed method guarantees an identical solution to the full problem but significantly reduces computational time. The solution's accuracy is shown through C-OPF properties. Even with incorrectly screened constraints, a recovery process is possible. This results in a problem with fewer constraints than the original. Extensive simulations conducted on the quadratic-convex model show that our method outperforms other constraint screening techniques.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a systematic methodological framework to design and analyze distributed algorithms for optimization and games over networks. Starting from a centralized method, we identify an aggregation function involving all the decision variables (e.g., a global cost gradient or constraint) and introduce a distributed consensus-oriented scheme to asymptotically approximate the unavailable information at each agent. Then, we delineate the proper methodology for intertwining the identified building blocks, i.e., the optimization-oriented method and the consensus-oriented one. The key intuition is to interpret the obtained interconnection as a singularly perturbed system. We rely on this interpretation to provide sufficient conditions for the building blocks to be successfully connected into a distributed scheme exhibiting the convergence guarantees of the centralized algorithm. Finally, we show the potential of our approach by developing a new distributed scheme for constraint-coupled problems with a linear convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the issues regarding the convergence of the Policy Iteration Algorithm(PIA) for a class of general continuous-time entropy-regularized stochastic control problems. In particular, instead of employing sophisticated PDE estimates for the iterative PDEs involved in the PIA (see, e.g., Huang-Wang-Zhou(2023)), we shall provide a simple proof from scratch for the convergence of the PIA. Our approach builds on probabilistic representation formulae for solutions of PDEs and their derivatives. Moreover, in the infinite horizon model with large discount factor and in the finite horizon model, the similar arguments lead to the exponential rate of convergence of PIA without tear. Finally, with some extra efforts we show that our approach can also be extended to the case when diffusion contains control, in the one dimensional setting but without much extra constraints on the coefficients. We believe that these results are new in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that has foundations in the line search sequential quadratic programming paradigm for solving general nonlinear equality constrained optimization problems. The method employs a carefully designed modified line search strategy that utilizes second-order information of both the objective and constraint functions, as required, to mitigate the Maratos effect. Contrary to classical line search sequential quadratic programming methods, our proposed method is endowed with global convergence and local superlinear convergence guarantees. Moreover, we extend the method and analysis to the setting in which the constraint functions are deterministic but the objective function is stochastic or can be represented as a finite-sum. We also design and implement a practical inexact matrix-free variant of the method. Finally, numerical results illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate second-order necessary conditions and exact penalty of mathematical programs with switching constraints (MPSC). Some new second-order constraint qualifications and second-order quasi-normality are introduced for (MPSC), which are crucial to establish the second-order necessary conditions and the error bound of (MPSC). We explore the relations among these constraint qualifications in term of (MPSC). The characterizations of Mordukhovich stationary point and strong stationary point of (MPSC) are derived under some mild conditions. A sufficient condition is provided for a Mordukhovich stationary point of (MPSC) being a strong stationary point. The strong second-order necessary conditions as well as weak second-order necessary conditions of (MPSC) are established under these weak constraint qualifications. Finally, we obtain the local exact penalty of (MPSC) under the local error bound or some constraint qualifications in term of (MPSC).</description>

      <title>Load Restoration in Islanded Microgrids: Formulation and Solution Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adverse circumstances such as extreme weather events can cause significant disruptions to normal operation of electric distribution systems (DS), which includes isolating parts of the DS due to damaged transmission equipment. In this paper, we consider the problem of load restoration in a microgrid (MG) that is islanded from the upstream DS. The MG contains sources of distributed generation such as microturbines and renewable energy sources, as well as energy storage systems (ESS). We formulate the load restoration task as a non-convex optimization problem. This problem embodies the physics of the MG by leveraging a branch flow model, while incorporating salient phenomenon in islanded MGs such as the need for internal frequency regulation, and complementarity requirements arising in ESS operations. Since the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we introduce a convex relaxation which can be solved through model predictive control as a baseline method. However, in order to solve the problem considering its full non-convexity, we leverage a policy-learning method called constrained policy optimization, a tailored version of which is used as our proposed algorithm. The aforementioned approaches, along with an additional deep learning method are compared through extensive simulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a non-local tumour growth model of phase-field type, describing the evolution of tumour cells through proliferation in presence of a nutrient. The model consists of a coupled system, incorporating a non-local Cahn-Hilliard equation for the tumour phase variable and a reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient. First, we establish novel regularity results for such a model, by applying maximal regularity theory in weighted $L^p$ spaces. This technique enables us to prove the local existence and uniqueness of a regular solution, including also chemotaxis effects. By leveraging time-regularisation properties and global boundedness estimates, we further extend the solution to a global one. These results provide the foundation for addressing an optimal distributed control problem, aimed at identifying a suitable therapy guiding the tumour towards a predefined target. Specifically, we prove the existence of an optimal therapy and, by studying the Fr\'echet-differentiability of the control-to-state operator and introducing the adjoint system, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions.</description>

      <title>A Correlation-induced Finite Difference Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05638</link>

Abstract: Estimating stochastic gradients is pivotal in fields like service systems within operations research. The classical method for this estimation is the finite difference approximation, which entails generating samples at perturbed inputs. Nonetheless, practical challenges persist in determining the perturbation and obtaining an optimal finite difference estimator in the sense of possessing the smallest mean squared error (MSE). To tackle this problem, we propose a double sample-recycling approach in this paper. Firstly, pilot samples are recycled to estimate the optimal perturbation. Secondly, recycling these pilot samples again and generating new samples at the estimated perturbation, lead to an efficient finite difference estimator. We analyze its bias, variance and MSE. Our analyses demonstrate a reduction in asymptotic variance, and in some cases, a decrease in asymptotic bias, compared to the optimal finite difference estimator. Therefore, our proposed estimator consistently coincides with, or even outperforms the optimal finite difference estimator. In numerical experiments, we apply the estimator in several examples, and numerical results demonstrate its robustness, as well as coincidence with the theory presented, especially in the case of small sample sizes.</description>
