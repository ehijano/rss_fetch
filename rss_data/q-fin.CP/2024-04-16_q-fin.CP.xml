      <title>Quantum Risk Analysis of Financial Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two quantum algorithms to compute the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of financial derivatives using quantum computers: the first by applying existing ideas from quantum risk analysis to derivative pricing, and the second based on a novel approach using Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Previous work in the literature has shown that quantum advantage is possible in the context of individual derivative pricing and that advantage can be leveraged in a straightforward manner in the estimation of the VaR and CVaR. The algorithms we introduce in this work aim to provide an additional advantage by encoding the derivative price over multiple market scenarios in superposition and computing the desired values by applying appropriate transformations to the quantum system. We perform complexity and error analysis of both algorithms, and show that while the two algorithms have the same asymptotic scaling the QSP-based approach requires significantly fewer quantum resources for the same target accuracy. Additionally, by numerically simulating both quantum and classical VaR algorithms, we demonstrate that the quantum algorithm can extract additional advantage from a quantum computer compared to individual derivative pricing. Specifically, we show that under certain conditions VaR estimation can lower the latest published estimates of the logical clock rate required for quantum advantage in derivative pricing by up to $\sim 30$x. In light of these results, we are encouraged that our formulation of derivative pricing in the QSP framework may be further leveraged for quantum advantage in other relevant financial applications, and that quantum computers could be harnessed more efficiently by considering problems in the financial sector at a higher level.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of Human Perception, Behaviour and Decision-Making: A Do-It-Yourself Model Kit for Modelling Optical Illusions and Opinion Formation in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the surface, behavioural science and physics seem to be two disparate fields of research. However, a closer examination of problems solved by them reveals that they are uniquely related to one another. Exemplified by the theories of quantum mind, cognition and decision-making, this unique relationship serves as the topic of this chapter. Surveying the current academic journal papers and scholarly monographs, we present an alternative vision of the role of quantum mechanics in the modern studies of human perception, behaviour and decision-making. To that end, we mostly aim to answer the 'how' question, deliberately avoiding complex mathematical concepts but developing a technically simple computational code that the readers can modify to design their own quantum-inspired models. We also present several practical examples of the application of the computation code and outline several plausible scenarios, where quantum models based on the proposed do-it-yourself model kit can help understand the differences between the behaviour of individuals and social groups.</description>

      <title>Construction of Domain-specified Japanese Large Language Model for Finance through Continual Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used in various fields, including finance. However, Japanese financial-specific LLMs have not been proposed yet. Hence, this study aims to construct a Japanese financial-specific LLM through continual pre-training. Before tuning, we constructed Japanese financial-focused datasets for continual pre-training. As a base model, we employed a Japanese LLM that achieved state-of-the-art performance on Japanese financial benchmarks among the 10-billion-class parameter models. After continual pre-training using the datasets and the base model, the tuned model performed better than the original model on the Japanese financial benchmarks. Moreover, the outputs comparison results reveal that the tuned model's outputs tend to be better than the original model's outputs in terms of the quality and length of the answers. These findings indicate that domain-specific continual pre-training is also effective for LLMs. The tuned model is publicly available on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Derivative Pricing using Quantum Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pricing financial derivatives on quantum computers typically includes quantum arithmetic components which contribute heavily to the quantum resources required by the corresponding circuits. In this manuscript, we introduce a method based on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) to encode financial derivative payoffs directly into quantum amplitudes, alleviating the quantum circuits from the burden of costly quantum arithmetic. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, we find that for derivative contracts of practical interest, the application of QSP significantly reduces the required resources across all metrics considered, most notably the total number of T-gates by $\sim 16$x and the number of logical qubits by $\sim 4$x. Additionally, we estimate that the logical clock rate needed for quantum advantage is also reduced by a factor of $\sim 5$x. Overall, we find that quantum advantage will require $4.7$k logical qubits, and quantum devices that can execute $10^9$ T-gates at a rate of $45$MHz. While in this work we focus specifically on the payoff component of the derivative pricing process where the method we present is most readily applicable, similar techniques can be employed to further reduce the resources in other applications, such as state preparation.</description>
