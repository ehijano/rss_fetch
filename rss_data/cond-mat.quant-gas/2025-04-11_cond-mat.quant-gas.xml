      <title>Mott transition in excitonic Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a neutral system of positive and negative charges, such as atoms in a crystal, increasing the density causes the Mott transition from bound electrons to free electrons. The density of optically generated electron-hole systems can be controlled in situ by the power of optical excitation that enables the Mott transition from excitons, the bound pairs of electrons and holes, to free electrons and holes with increasing density. These Mott transitions occur in systems of pairs of the same kind, such as atoms or excitons. However, a different type of the Mott transition can occur for Bose polarons. A Bose polaron is a mobile particle of one kind in a Bose gas of particles of another kind. For the Mott transition in polarons, the polaron states vanish with increasing density of the surrounding gas. In this paper, we present the observation of this type of the Mott transition and the measurement of the Mott transition parameter $n_{\rm M}^{1/2} a_{\rm B}$ in 2D excitonic Bose polarons.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature real-time properties of magnetic polarons in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to significant progress in quantum gas microscopy in recent years, there is a rapidly growing interest in real-space properties of single mobile dopands created in correlated antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulators. However, a detailed numerical description remains challenging, even for simple toy models. As a consequence, previous numerical simulations for large systems were largely limited to $T=0$. To provide guidance for cold-atom experiments, numerical calculations at finite temperature are required. Here, we numerically study the real-time properties of a single mobile hole in the 2D $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature and draw a comparison to features observed at $T=0$. We find that a three-stage process of hole motion, which was reported at $T=0$, is valid even at finite temperature. However, already at low temperatures, the average hole velocity at long times is not simply proportional to the spin coupling, contrary to the $T=0$ behavior. Comparing our finite-temperature numerical results with the experimental data from quantum gas microscopy we find a qualitative disagreement: in experiment, hole spreading speeds up with increasing $J/t$, while in our numerics it slows down. The latter is consistent with the numerical findings previously reported at $T=0$.</description>

      <title>Atomic Regional Superfluids in two-dimensional Moir\'e Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e physics has transcended spatial dimensions, extending into synthetic domains and enabling novel quantum phenomena. We propose a theoretical model for a two-dimensional (2D) Moir\'e time crystal formed by ultracold atoms, induced by periodic perturbations applied to a non-lattice trap. Our analysis reveals the emergence of regional superfluid states exhibiting moir\'e-scale quantum coherence across temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal domains. This work provides fundamental insights into temporal moir\'e phenomena and presents an alternative pathway to engineer spatial moir\'e phases without requiring twisted multilayer lattices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polarons at finite temperature: One-hole spectroscopy study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated fermions described by Hubbard or $t$-$J$ models in the underdoped regime -- relevant for high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate compounds -- remains a subject of ongoing debate. In particular, the nature of charge carriers in this regime is poorly understood, in part due to the unusual properties of their spectral function. In this Letter, we present unbiased numerical results for the one-hole spectral function in a $t$-$J$ model at finite temperatures. Our study provides valuable insights into the underlying physics of magnetic (or spin-) polaron formation in a doped antiferromagnet (AFM). For example, we find how the suppression of spectral weight outside the magnetic Brillouin zone -- a precursor of Fermi arc formation -- disappears with increasing temperature, revealing nearly-deconfined spinon excitations of the undoped AFM. The pristine setting we consider can be directly explored using quantum simulators. Our calculations demonstrate that coherent quasiparticle peaks associated with magnetic polarons can be observed up to temperatures $T&gt;J$ above the spin-exchange $J$, routinely obtained in such experiments. This paves the way for future studies of the fate of magnetic polarons in the pseudogap phase.</description>

      <title>Three-component Bose-Einstein condensates and wetting without walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work within Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) theory for ultracold gases wetting phase transitions were predicted for a phase-segregated two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) adsorbed at an optical wall. The wetting phase diagram was found to depend on intrinsic atomic parameters, being the masses and the scattering lengths, and on the extrinsic wall boundary condition. Here we study wetting transitions in GP theory without an optical wall in a setting with three phase-segregated BEC components instead of two. The boundary condition is removed by replacing the wall with the third component and treating the three phases on an equal footing. This leads to an unequivocal wetting phase diagram that depends only on intrinsic atomic parameters. It features first-order and critical wetting transitions, and prewetting phenomena. The phase boundaries are computed by numerical solution of the GP equations. In addition, useful analytic results are obtained by extending the established double-parabola approximation to three components.</description>

      <title>Nonuniversal Equation of State of a Quasi-2D Bose Gas in Dimensional Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equation of state (EOS) for a pure two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the s-wave scattering length [L. Salasnich, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 130402 (2017)]. The pronounced disparity between the EOS of a 2D Bose gas and its 3D counterpart underscores the significance of exploring the dimensional crossover between these two distinct dimensions. In this work, we are motivated to deduce nonuniversal corrections to EOS for an optically trapped Bose gas along the dimensional crossover from 3D to 2D, incorporating the finite-range effects of the interatomic potential. Employing the framework of effective field theory, we derive the analytical expressions for both the ground state energy and quantum depletion. The introduction of the lattice induces a transition from a 3D to a quasi-2D regime. In particular, we systematically analyze the asymptotic behaviors of both the 2D and 3D aspects of the model system, with a specific focus on the nonuniversal effects on the EOS arising from finite-range interactions. The nonuniversal effects proposed in this study along the dimensional crossover represent a significant stride toward unraveling the intricate interplay between dimensionality and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Transition temperature and thermodynamic properties of homogeneous weakly interacting Bose gas in self-consistent Popov approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study utilizes the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action approach combined with variational perturbation theory to investigate the relative shift in the transition temperature of a homogeneous, repulsive, weakly interacting Bose gas compared to that of an ideal Bose gas. By applying both the one-loop and self-consistent Popov approximations, the universal form of the relative shift in the transition temperature is derived, demonstrating its proportionality to the s-wave scattering length. The results exhibit excellent agreement with those obtained from precise Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the zero-point energy and various thermodynamic properties are examined in both the condensed and normal phases. A comparison with experimental data reveals an excellent agreement, further validating the findings.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable active steering protocols for genuinely entangled state manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 22 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.</description>

      <title>Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.</description>
