      <title>St\"ackel transform, coupling constant metamorphosis and algebraization of quasi-exactly solvable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the notions of the St\"ackel transform and the coupling constant metamorphosis to quasi-exactly solvable systems. We discover that for a variety of one-dimensional and separable multidimensional quasi-exactly solvable systems, their $sl(2)$ algebraizations can only be achieved via coupling constant metamorphosis after appropriate St\"ackel transformations. This discovery has interesting applications, allowing us to derive algebraizations and energies for a wide class of quasi-exactly solvable systems, such as Hooke's atoms in magnetic fields and Newtonian cosmology. The approach of coupling constant metamorphosis was successfully applied previously in the context of exactly solvable, integrable and superintegrable systems. To our knowledge, the present work is the first to apply the idea and approach in the context of quasi-exactly solvable systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and exact solutions of a reaction-diffusion system arising in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system of two cubic reaction-diffusion equations for two independent gene frequencies arising in population dynamics is studied. Depending on values of coefficients, all possible Lie and $Q$-conditional (nonclassical) symmetries are identified. A wide range of new exact solutions is constructed, including those expressible in terms of a Lambert function and not obtainable by Lie symmetries. An example of a new real-world application of the system is discussed. A general algorithm for finding Q-conditional symmetries of nonlinear evolution systems of the most general form is presented in a useful form for other researchers.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in finite cutoff JT gravity: A study of baby universes and (Krylov) complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, as an application of the `Complexity = Volume' proposal, we calculate the growth of the interior of a black hole at late times for finite cutoff JT gravity. Due to this integrable, irrelevant deformation, the spectral properties are modified non-trivially. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) length saturates faster than pure JT gravity. We comment on the possible connection between Krylov Complexity and ERB length for deformed theory. Apart from this, we calculate the emission probability of baby universes for the deformed theory and make remarks on its implications for the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. Finally, we compute the correction to the volume of the moduli space due to the non-perturbative change of the spectral curve because of the finite cutoff at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Conditional Mutual Information and Information-Theoretic Phases of Decohered Gibbs States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical and quantum Markov networks -- including Gibbs states of commuting local Hamiltonians -- are characterized by the vanishing of conditional mutual information (CMI) between spatially separated subsystems. Adding local dissipation to a Markov network turns it into a \emph{hidden Markov network}, in which CMI is not guaranteed to vanish even at long distances. The onset of long-range CMI corresponds to an information-theoretic mixed-state phase transition, with far-ranging implications for teleportation, decoding, and state compressions. Little is known, however, about the conditions under which dissipation can generate long-range CMI. In this work we provide the first rigorous results in this direction. We establish that CMI in high-temperature Gibbs states subject to local dissipation decays exponentially, (i) for classical Hamiltonians subject to arbitrary local transition matrices, and (ii) for commuting local Hamiltonians subject to unital channels that obey certain mild restrictions. Conversely, we show that low-temperature hidden Markov networks can sustain long-range CMI. Our results establish the existence of finite-temperature information-theoretic phase transitions even in models that have no finite-temperature thermodynamic phase transitions. We also show several applications in quantum information and many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus in terms of the representation of $GL(2,\bZ)$. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to unoriented surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we can assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to unoriented surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Induced Quantum Divergence: A New Lens on Communication and Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the induced divergence, a new quantum divergence measure that replaces the hypothesis testing divergence in position-based decoding, simplifying the analysis of quantum communication and state redistribution while yielding tighter achievability bounds. Derived from a parent quantum relative entropy, it retains key properties such as data processing inequality and L\"owner monotonicity. Like the hypothesis testing divergence, it depends on a smoothing parameter and interpolates between the parent relative entropy (as the smoothing parameter approaches one) and the min-relative entropy (as it approaches zero), the latter holding when applied to the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy of order $\alpha\in[0,2]$. This framework refines the position-based decoding lemma, extending its applicability to a broader class of states and improving decoding success probabilities. Two key applications are considered: classical communication over quantum channels, where the induced divergence improves lower bounds on the distillable communication rate, and quantum state redistribution, where it leads to sharper bounds on communication costs. These results provide new insights into fundamental single-shot quantum information protocols and enhance existing analytical techniques.</description>

      <title>The anisotropic Cahn--Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility: Existence of weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an existence result for the anisotropic Cahn--Hilliard equation characterized by a potentially concentration-dependent degenerate mobility taking into account an anisotropic energy. The model allows for the degeneracy of the mobility at specific concentration values, demonstrating that the solution remains within physically relevant bounds. The introduction of anisotropy leads to highly nonlinear terms making energy and entropy estimates rather involved. As the mobility degenerates in the pure phases, the degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation describes surface diffusion and is an important model to model solid-state dewetting (SSD) of thin films. We show existence of weak solutions for the anisotropic degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation by using suitable energy and entropy type estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>A Positive Quasilocal Mass for Causal Variational Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new inequality for a nonlinear surface layer integral is proved for minimizers of causal variational principles. This inequality is applied to obtain a new proof of the positive mass theorem with volume constraint. Next, a positive mass theorem without volume constraint is stated and proved by introducing and using the concept of asymptotic alignment. Moreover, a positive quasilocal mass and a synthetic definition of scalar curvature are introduced in the setting of causal variational principles. Our notions and results are illustrated by the explicit examples of causal fermion systems constructed in ultrastatic spacetimes and the Schwarzschild spacetime. In these examples, the correspondence to the ADM mass and similarities to the Brown-York mass are worked out.</description>

      <title>On the discrete Dirac spectrum of general-relativistic hydrogenic ions with anomalous magnetic moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reissner-Weyl-Nordstr\"om (RWN) spacetime of a point nucleus features a naked singularity for the empirically known nuclear charges $Ze$ and masses $M = A(Z,N)m_{\mathrm{p}}$, where $m_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the proton mass and $A(Z,N)\approx Z+N$ the atomic mass number, with $Z$ the number of protons and $N$ the number of neutrons in the nucleus. The Dirac Hamiltonian for a test electron with mass $m_{\mathrm{e}}$, charge $-e$, and anomalous magnetic moment $\mu_a (\approx - \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{e^3}{m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2})$ in the electrostatic RWN spacetime of such a 'naked point nucleus' is known to be essentially self-adjoint, with a spectrum that consists of the union of the essential spectrum $(-\infty, m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2]\cup[m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2, \infty)$ and a discrete spectrum of infinitely many eigenvalues in the gap $(-m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2,m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2)$, having $m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2$ as accumulation point. In this paper the discrete spectrum is characterized in detail for the first time, for all $Z\leq 45$ and $A$ that cover all known isotopes. The eigenvalues are mapped one-to-one to those of the traditional Dirac Hydrogen spectrum. Numerical evaluations that go beyond $Z=45$ into the realm of not-yet-produced hydrogenic ions are presented, too. A list of challenging open problems concludes this publication.</description>

Abstract: We frame Newton's Law of Cooling as a gradient flow within the context of information geometry. This connects it to a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the Horse-Carrot Theorem, and reveals novel instances of asymmetric relaxations in endoreversible processes. We present a general criterion for predicting asymmetries using the Amari-Chentsov tensor, applicable to classical and quantum thermodynamics. Examples include faster cooling of quantum ideal gases and relaxations that resemble the Mpemba effect in classical ideal gases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of the triple Hodge integrals satisfying the Calabi-Yau condition. For the tau-functions, which generate these integrals, we derive the complete families of the Heisenberg-Virasoro constraints. We also construct several equivalent versions of the cut-and-join operators. These operators describe the algebraic version of topological recursion. For the specific values of parameters associated with the KdV reduction, we prove that these tau-functions are equal to the generating functions of intersection numbers of $\psi$ and $\kappa$ classes. We interpret this relation as a symplectic invariance of the Chekhov--Eynard--Orantin topological recursion and prove this recursion for the general $\Theta$-case.</description>

      <title>Border Ranks of Positive and Invariant Tensor Decompositions: Applications to Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix rank and its positive versions are robust for small approximations, i.e. they do not decrease under small perturbations. In contrast, the multipartite tensor rank can collapse for arbitrarily small errors, i.e. there may be a gap between rank and border rank, leading to instabilities in the optimization over sets with fixed tensor rank. Can multipartite positive ranks also collapse for small perturbations? In this work, we prove that multipartite positive and invariant tensor decompositions exhibit gaps between rank and border rank, including tensor rank purifications and cyclic separable decompositions. We also prove a correspondence between positive decompositions and membership in certain sets of multipartite probability distributions, and leverage the gaps between rank and border rank to prove that these correlation sets are not closed. It follows that testing membership of probability distributions arising from resources like translational invariant Matrix Product States is impossible in finite time. Overall, this work sheds light on the instability of ranks and the unique behavior of bipartite systems.</description>

      <title>Bratteli networks and the Spectral Action on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of noncommutative geometry, we consider quiver representations -- not on vector spaces, as traditional, but on finite-dimensional prespectral triples (`discrete topological noncommutative spaces'). A similar idea appeared in the original work of Marcolli-van Suijlekom on quiver representations in spectral triples (`discrete noncommutative geometries'), which paved the way for some of our results in independent directions. We introduce Bratteli networks, a structure that yields a neat combinatorial characterisation of the space $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$ of prespectral-triple-representations of a quiver $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$, as well as of the gauge group and of their quotient. Not only these claims that make it possible to `integrate over $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$' are, as we now argue, in line with the spirit of random noncommutative geometry -- formulating path integrals over Dirac operators -- but they also contain a physically relevant case. Namely, the equivalence between quiver representations and path algebra modules, established here for the new category, inspired the following construction: Only from representation theory data, we build a spectral triple for the quiver and evaluate the spectral action functional from a general formula over closed paths. When we apply this construction to lattice-quivers, we obtain not only Wilsonian Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory, but also the Weisz-Wohlert-cells in the context of Symanzik's improved gauge theory. We show that a hermitian (`Higgs') matrix field emerges from the self-loops of the quiver and derive the Yang-Mills--Higgs theory on flat space as a smooth limit.</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. Much like for geodesic motion, a sufficient number of conserved quantities allows the motion to be solved by quadrature. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), the motion can then be described in terms of the evolution these "conserved quantities". This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we derive a corresponding flux-balance law, to linear order in spin, directly relating average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and out to infinity. In the absence of spin, this reproduces results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin, we construct flux-balance laws for four of the five constants of motion for spinning bodies in the Kerr spacetime, although not in a practical form. However, this result provides a promising path towards deriving the flux-balance law for the (generalized) Carter constant.</description>

      <title>A rigorous approach to pattern formation for isotropic isoperimetric problems with competing nonlocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous approach to the study of the symmetry breaking and pattern formation phenomenon for isotropic functionals with local/nonlocal interactions in competition.
  We consider a general class of nonlocal variational problems in dimension $d\geq 2$, in which an isotropic surface term favouring pure phases competes with an isotropic nonlocal term with power law kernel favouring alternation between different phases.
  Close to the critical regime in which the two terms are of the same order, we give a rigorous proof of the conjectured structure of global minimizers, in the shape of domains with flat boundary (e.g., stripes or lamellae).
  The natural framework in which our approach is set and developed is the one of calculus of variations and geometric measure theory.
  Among others, we detect a nonlocal curvature-type quantity which is controlled by the energy functional and whose finiteness implies flatness for sufficiently regular boundaries.
  The power of decay of the considered kernels at infinity is $p\geq d+3$ and it is related to pattern formation in synthetic antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Sampling from the Continuous Random Energy Model in Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a toy model of spin glasses on $\{0,1\}^N$ that, in the limit, exhibits an infinitely hierarchical correlation structure. We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime $\beta&lt;\beta_{\min}:=\min\{\beta_c,\beta_G\}$, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g)^{O(1)}$, where $g$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold $\beta_{\min}$; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; while for $A$ non-concave, if $\beta_G&lt;\beta_c$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.</description>

      <title>Ocneanu Algebra of Seams: Critical Unitary $E_6$ RSOS Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $A$ series and exceptional $E_6$ Restricted Solid-On-Solid lattice models as prototypical examples of the critical Yang-Baxter integrable two-dimensional $A$-$D$-$E$ lattice models. We focus on type I theories which are characterized by the existence of an extended chiral symmetry in the continuum scaling limit. Starting with the commuting family of column transfer matrices on the torus, we build matrix representations of the Ocneanu graph fusion algebra as integrable seams for arbitrary finite-size lattices with the structure constants specified by Petkova and Zuber. This commutative seam algebra contains the Verlinde, fused adjacency and graph fusion algebras as subalgebras. Our matrix representation of the Ocneanu algebra encapsulates the quantum symmetry of the commuting family of transfer matrices. In the continuum scaling limit, the integrable seams realize the topological defects of the associated conformal field theory and the known toric matrices encode the twisted conformal partition functions.</description>

      <title>The full electroweak interaction: an autonomous account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise renormalizable interactions in the bosonic sector of electroweak theory are intrinsically determined in the autonomous approach to perturbation theory. This proceeds directly on the Hilbert-Fock space built on the Wigner unirreps of the physical particles, with their given masses: those of three massive vector bosons, a photon, and a massive scalar (the "higgs"). Neither "gauge choices" nor an unobservable "mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking" is invoked. Instead, to proceed on Hilbert space requires using string-localized fields to describe the vector bosons. In such a framework, the condition of string independence of the S-matrix yields consistency constraints on the coupling coefficients, the essentially unique outcome being the experimentally known one. The analysis can be largely carried out for other configurations of massive and massless vector bosons, paving the way towards consideration of consistent mass patterns beyond those of the electroweak theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Smith analysis of resonance perturbations in arbitrary $Q$ non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbing resonant systems causes shifts in their associated scattering poles in the complex plane. In a previous study [arXiv: 2408.11360], we demonstrated that these shifts can be calculated numerically by analyzing the residue of a generalized Wigner-Smith operator associated with the perturbation parameter. In this work, we extend this approach by connecting the Wigner-Smith formalism with results from standard electromagnetic perturbation theory applicable to open systems with resonances of arbitrary quality factors. We further demonstrate the utility of the method through several numerical examples, including the inverse design of a multi-layered nanoresonator sensor and an analysis of the enhanced sensitivity of scattering zeros to perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present generalizations and modifications of Eldan's Stochastic Localization process, extending it to incorporate non-Gaussian tilts, making it useful for a broader class of measures. As an application, we introduce new processes that enable the decomposition and analysis of non-quadratic potentials on the Boolean hypercube, with a specific focus on quartic polynomials. Using this framework, we derive new spectral gap estimates for tensor Ising models under Glauber dynamics, resulting in rapid mixing.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <title>Global critical points of the Standard Model on four-dimensional spacetimes of expanding type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of elementary particle physics is one of the most successful models of contemporary theoretical physics being in full agreement with experiments. However, its mathematical structure deserves further investigations both from a geometric and an analytic point of view. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a mathematically well-defined and self-contained description of the Standard Model in terms of gauge theory and differential geometry on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Within this setup we then prove the existence of a global solution for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Standard Model (with the conformal Higgs potential) under the assumptions that the globally hyperbolic manifold is a four-dimensional spacetime of expanding type and small initial data. This is achieved by establishing a gauge-invariant energy estimate which is of independent mathematical interest.</description>
