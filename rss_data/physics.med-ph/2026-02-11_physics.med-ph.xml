      <title>Inter-Electrode Pulse Wave Velocity: A Direct Method for Maternal Arterial Stiffness Assessment During Pregnancy Using Multi-Channel ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To validate a novel inter-electrode PWV method that directly measures pulse wave propagation between spatially separated electrodes, avoiding LVET estimation. Methods: We analyzed 43 multi-channel ECG recordings (3 channels, 1000 Hz) from the FELICITy 2 cohort (pregnant women, $\sim$19 and $\sim$35 weeks gestation). R-peaks were detected independently on each channel using an ensemble detector. Time lags ($\Delta t$) between matched R-peaks on electrode pairs were calculated, and PWV computed as PWV = $L$/$\Delta t$, where $L$ is an effective inter-electrode distance. Three channel pairs provided independent PWV estimates per recording. Temporal stability was assessed using sliding window analysis (1--15 minutes). To investigate whether $\Delta t$ reflects morphological distortion or vascular propagation, we performed signal origin analysis using three QRS fiducial points (R-peak maximum, QRS onset, maximum $|dV/dt|$) and two bandpass settings (0.5--40 and 0.5--100~Hz). Longitudinal changes were compared between Control (n=24) and prenatal Yoga intervention (n=20) groups. Results: Inter-electrode PWV yielded physiologically plausible values (Control First: 7.40$\pm$1.51 m/s, Control Last: 6.98$\pm$1.63 m/s; Yoga First: 7.10$\pm$2.15 m/s, Yoga Last: 8.16$\pm$0.91 m/s), consistent with literature values for aortic PWV (5--10 m/s). Temporal stability analysis demonstrated PWV stabilizes at 5 minutes (CV=12.3\%), with 2.6--5.2$\times$ better stability than heart rate and HRV metrics. Signal origin analysis showed that inter-electrode delays persisted across all QRS fiducial points (15--27~ms) and were insensitive to bandpass changes ($-$8.5\%, NS), arguing against pure morphological distortion; all conditions yielded PWV within 6.8--9.1~m/s. Preliminary group comparison suggests different trajectories (Control: --5.7\% decrease, Yoga: +14.9\% increase, p=0.07 for interaction). Conclusions: Inter-electrode PWV provides direct spatial measurement of pulse wave propagation with physiologically valid values, independent of LVET estimation. Signal origin analysis supports the robustness of this empirical surrogate across fiducial and filter conditions. Method shows promise for pregnancy arterial stiffness assessment using standard multi-channel ECG equipment. Further validation against gold-standard measures and accurate electrode distance determination are needed.</description>

      <title>Towards a topological view of blood pressure regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood pressure regulation is commonly addressed in terms of local mechanisms such as vascular resistance, compliance and neurohumoral control. However, the human vasculature encompasses multiple quasi-closed flow loops under both physiological and pathological conditions. To test whether these loops could influence pressure dynamics beyond local control, we address the role of vascular topology in blood pressure regulation. Using one dimensional flow simulation models, we compared pressure dynamics in open vascular segments and closed vascular loops. We found that in open segments pressure fades away and remains spatially localized, whereas in closed loops pressure can keep circulating around the loop even if resistance in one spot is modified. Since parallel pathways within loops are dynamically coupled rather than independent, pressure changes in one place can affect the entire closed loop, allowing system level pressure patterns to emerge. Also, we assessed the temporal evolution of pressure fluctuations within closed vascular loops in normotensive and hypertensive parameter regimes, before and after loop breaking intervention. This topological approach helps clarifying why drugs or local interventions may fail to lower blood pressure in looped vascular architectures, providing a theoretical interpretation of some forms of resistant hypertension. Because disrupting a loop restores pressure relaxation, it may also help explain the disproportionate pressure changes observed after topology altering events like thrombosis, vascular surgery or embolization of arteriovenous malformations and shunts. Therefore, vascular topology can influence cardiovascular physiology by coupling local pressure flow relations to global constraints on blood pressure regulation, with physiological, pathological and clinical implications.</description>
