      <title>Energy budgets govern synaptic precision and its regulation during plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synaptic transmission must balance the need for reliable signalling against the metabolic cost of achieving that reliability. How energetic constraints shape synaptic precision and its regulation during plasticity remains unclear. Here we develop an energy--constrained framework in which synapses minimise postsynaptic response variance subject to a fixed mean and an effective energy budget. Combinations of candidate physiological costs are used to estimate an energy cost for synaptic transmission; this cost is then inferred from quantal statistics. Analysing five published pre- and post-plasticity datasets, we find that observed synaptic mean--variance pairs cluster near a minimal-energy boundary, indicating that precision is limited by energetic availability. Model comparison identifies a dominant calcium pump-like cost paired with a smaller vesicle turnover-like cost, yielding a separable precision--energy relationship, $\sigma^{-2} \propto E^5$. We further show that plasticity systematically updates synaptic energy budgets according to the scale-free magnitude of mean change, enabling accurate prediction of post-plasticity variance from energy allocation alone. These results provide direct experimental support for the hypothesis that synaptic precision is governed by energy budgets, establishing energy allocation as a fundamental principle linking metabolic constraints, synaptic reliability, and plasticity.</description>

      <title>A golden-ratio partition of information and the balance between prediction and surprise: a neuro-cognitive route to antifragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive systems must strike a balance between prediction and surprise to thrive in uncertain environments. We propose an information-theoretic balance function, $ f(p) = -(1 - p)\ln(1 - p) + \ln p $, which quantifies the net informational gain from contrasting explained variance $p$ with unexplained novelty $(1 - p)$. This function is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ and reaches its unique maximum at $ p^* \approx 0.882$, revealing a regime where confidence is high but the residual uncertainty carries a disproportionate potential for surprise.
  Independently of this maximum, imposing a self-similarity condition between known, unknown and total information, $p : (1-p) = 1 : p$, leads to the golden-ratio reciprocal $p = 1/\varphi \approx 0.618$, where $ \varphi$ is the golden ratio. We interpret this value not as the maximizer of $f$, but as a structurally privileged \emph{partition} in which known and unknown are proportionally nested across scales.
  Embedding this dual structure into a Compute-Inference-Model-Action (CIMA) loop yields a dynamic process that maintains the system near a critical regime where prediction and surprise coexist. At this edge, neuronal dynamics exhibit power-law structure and maximal dynamic range, while the system's response to perturbations becomes convex at the level of its payoff function-fulfilling the formal definition of antifragility. We suggest that the golden-ratio partition is not merely a mathematical artifact, but a candidate design principle linking prediction, surprise, criticality, and antifragile adaptation across scales and domains, while the maximum of $f$ identifies the point of greatest informational vulnerability to being wrong.</description>

      <title>A Foundational Theory for Decentralized Sensory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, popular functional frameworks and neural network formulations operate by making use of extrinsic error measurements and global learning algorithms. Through a set of conjectures based on evolutionary insights on the origin of cellular adaptive mechanisms, we reinterpret the core meaning of sensory signals to allow the brain to be interpreted as a negative feedback control system, and show how this could lead to local learning algorithms without the need for global error correction metrics. Thereby, a sufficiently good minima in sensory activity can be the complete reward signal of the network, as well as being both necessary and sufficient for biological learning to arise. We show that this method of learning was likely already present in the earliest unicellular life forms on earth. We show evidence that the same principle holds and scales to multicellular organisms where it in addition can lead to division of labour between cells. Available evidence shows that the evolution of the nervous system likely was an adaptation to more effectively communicate intercellular signals to support such division of labour. We therefore propose that the same learning principle that evolved already in the earliest unicellular life forms, i.e. negative feedback control of externally and internally generated sensor signals, has simply been scaled up to become a fundament of the learning we see in biological brains today. We illustrate diverse biological settings, from the earliest unicellular organisms to humans, where this operational principle appears to be a plausible interpretation of the meaning of sensor signals in biology, how this relates to current neuroscientific theories and findings, and how it can be applied to solve body control.</description>

      <title>Lesion-Independent Associations Between Thalamic Nuclei Volumes and Information Processing Speed in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is driven by both focal inflammation and compartmentalized neurodegeneration, yet the relative effect of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy on information processing speed (IPS) remains unclear. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Results: Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These processing-associated ROIs exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that IPS impairment reflects heterogeneous contributions from focal lesion-driven and chronic neurodegenerative pathology, with nucleus-specific phenotyping potentially informing identification of higher risk individuals.</description>
