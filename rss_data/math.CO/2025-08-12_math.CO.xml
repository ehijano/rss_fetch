      <title>Diminished Sombor matrix, spectral radius, and energy of the graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a simple graph $G$ with vertex set $V = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ and edge set $E$. The diminished Sombor matrix $M_{DS}(G)$ is constructed such that its $(i, j)$ entry is $\frac{\sqrt{d_i^2+d_j^2}}{d_i+d_j}$ if vertices $v_iv_j \in E$, and $0$ otherwise, where $d_i$ represents the degree of vertex $v_i$. In this paper, we establish sharp bounds for the spectral radius, and energy of the Sombor matrix of graphs and identify the graphs that attain these extremal values.</description>

      <title>Diminished Sombor index and its relationship with topological indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Diminished Sombor index (DSO), a recently introduced degree-based topological index for a simple graph $G$, defined as \[ DSO(G) = \sum_{uv \in E} \frac{\sqrt{d_u^2+d_v^2}}{d_u+d_v}, \] where $d_u$ denotes the degree of a vertex $u \in V$. We establish several sharp bounds for this index in terms of classical topological indices such as the Zagreb, Albertson, Harmonic, Randi\'c, and geometric-arithmetic indices. The relationships and inequalities between DSO and these indices are analyzed thoroughly, with characterizations of extremal graphs achieving equality conditions.</description>

      <title>Tropical fans supporting a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An affine tropical fan is called regular if it supports a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection. For some cases the classification of regular fans is already complete. It was proved by Fink that tropical varieties of degree 1 are exactly Bergman fans, and later Esterov and Gusev classified all lattice polytopes whose mixed volume equals 1. We introduce the notion of a gallery for tropical fans and use it to classify all one-dimensional regular fans, thereby obtaining a minimal model programme for such fans. In dimension 2 we prove a finiteness theorem: every regular fan that satisfies the given upper bound condition is precisely the support of a finite covering by two-dimensional galleries, and only finitely many such fans exist.</description>

      <title>The wild number of an edge-colored graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the wild number of an edge-colored graph as a measure of how close an edge-colored graph is to having a spanning tree in every color. This combinatorial concept originates in the algebraic theory of generalized graph splines. After showing that determining the wild number of a graph is an NP-complete problem, we provide bounds on the wild number and find the exact wild number for trees, cycles, and families of graphs with restrictions on the edge-colorings. This article serves as an invitation to the topic of wild numbers and includes several open problems, many of which are suitable for undergraduate research projects.</description>

      <title>Minor-excluded graphs and soficity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random rooted graph is said to be sofic if it is the Benjamini-Schramm limit of a sequence of finite graphs. Given any finite graph $H$, we prove that every one-ended, unimodular random rooted graph that does not have H as a minor must be sofic. The hypothesis regarding the number of ends can be dropped under the additional assumption that the graph is quasi-transitive.</description>

      <title>Finite Interpretation of the Hyper-Catalan Series Zero and its Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2025, Wildberger and Rubine showed the formal series zero of the univariate geometric polynomial is $\mathbf{S}$, the generating series for the hyper-Catalan numbers $\mathbf{C}_m$, which count the number of roofed subdivided polygons (subdigons) of type $\mathbf{m}$. We show that we can interpret this result as a finite identity at each level, where a level is a truncation of $\Sb$ to a given maximum number of vertices, edges, or faces (bounded by degree) of the associated subdigon types. We then explore powers $\mathbf{S}^r$, recounting Raney's and our own combinatorial derivations of its coefficients.</description>

      <title>Top to random and reverse: analysis of a new descent algebra shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the "top-to-random-and-reverse shuffle", defined as the top-to-random shuffle in the symmetric group algebra composed with the permutation $w_0$ (which sends each $i$ to $n+1-i$). More generally, we analyze the composition of any B-basis element of the descent algebra with $w_0$. We show that the minimal polynomial of any such composition (over $\mathbb{Q}$) factors into distinct linear factors, which correspond to the "signed knapsack numbers" of set compositions. This is a counterpart to an analogous property of the B-basis elements themselves, which was proved by Brown using Bidigare's face monoid. In the case of the top-to-random-and-reverse shuffle, the minimal polynomial turns out to be $\prod_{k \in \set{-n+2} \cup \interval{-n+4, n-3} \cup \set{0} \cup \set{n}} \tup{x-k}$.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces $(\alpha,a)$-parameterized Hurwitz-Lerch type poly-Bernoulli and poly-Cauchy numbers and polynomials, extending classical sequences through the Hurwitz-Lerch zeta function. We derive generating functions, recurrences, and explicit formulas, revealing deeper structures and connections with zeta functions and polylogarithms. The results enrich existing theory and open new directions in analytic number theory and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Bounds on skew dimensions and characters of symmetric groups via thick hook decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bound the number of standard tableaux of skew shapes via thick hook decompositions in the Naruse hook length formula. Combining this with elementary counting arguments in the Murnaghan--Nakayama rule, we establish a uniform bound on characters of symmetric groups $\mathfrak{S}_n$. In the case of balanced representations, this improves on the character bounds of F\'eray and \'Sniady for permutations with support size at least $n^{2/3}$, and is sharp for permutations with support size of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Unbounded degree spanning hypertrees in Dirac hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2001, Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi proved that every sufficiently large $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\left(1/2+\gamma\right)n$ contains all spanning trees with maximum degree at most $cn/\log n$. We extend this result to hypergraphs by considering loose hypertrees, which are linear hypergraphs obtained by successively adding edges that share exactly one vertex with a previous edge.
  For all $k &gt; \ell \geq 2$, we determine asymptotically optimal $\ell$-degree conditions that ensure the existence of all rooted spanning loose hypertrees, without any degree condition, in terms of the $(\ell-1)$-degree threshold for the existence of a perfect matching in $(k-1)$-graphs.
  As a corollary, we also asymptotically determine the $\ell$-degree threshold for the existence of bounded degree spanning loose hypertrees in $k$-graphs for $k/2 &lt; \ell &lt; k$, confirming a conjecture of Pehova and Petrova in this range. In our proof, we avoid the use of Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma.</description>

      <title>A decomposition of graph a-numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $a$-sequence $(a_0(G), a_1(G), \cdots)$ of a finite simple graph $G$, defined recursively through a combinatorial rule and known to coincide with the sequence of rational Betti numbers of the real toric variety associated with $G$.
  In this paper, we establish a combinatorial and topological decomposition formula for the $a$-sequence. As an application, we show that the $a$-sequence is monotone under graph inclusion; that is, $a_i(G) \geq a_i(H)$ for all $i \geq 0$ whenever $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. We also prove that the $a$-sequence is unimodal in $i$ for a broad class of graphs $G$, including those with a Hamiltonian circuit or a universal vertex. These results provide a new class of topological spaces whose Betti number sequences are unimodal but not necessarily log concave, contributing to the study of real loci in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>On $P$-crucial square-free permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutation is square-free if it does not contain two consecutive factors of length two or more that are order-isomorphic. A square-free permutation of length $n$ is $P$-crucial, where $P$ is a subset of $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, if any of its extensions in any position from the set $P$ contains a square. In 2015, Gent, Kitaev, Konovalov, Linton and Nightingale initiated the study of $P$-crucial square-free permutations. In particular, they showed that $\{0,1,n-1,n\}$-crucial square-free permutations of length $n$, where $n\leq 22$, exist if and only if $n=17$ or $n=21$. In this work, we prove that for any $m\geq 2$ there exists a $\{0,1,8m+4,8m+5\}$-crucial square-free permutation of length $8m+5$.</description>

      <title>Counting Graph Homomorphisms in Bipartite Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of counting homomorphisms from a bipartite source graph to a bipartite target graph. An exact formula is first derived for the number of homomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph into a general bipartite graph. While exact, this formula is typically computationally intensive to evaluate. To address this, computable combinatorial lower bounds are established. When the target graph contains no 4-cycles, the lower bound simplifies and becomes exact. Two additional lower bounds on the number of homomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph to an arbitrary bipartite graph are derived using properties of Shannon entropy. The first depends only on the sizes of the partite sets in the source and target graphs, along with the edge density of the target graph. The second further incorporates the degree profiles within the target's partite sets, yielding a strengthening of the first. Both entropy-based bounds improve upon the inequality implied by the validity of Sidorenko's conjecture for complete bipartite graphs. These lower bounds, applicable to complete bipartite sources, are then used with new auxiliary results and a known reverse Sidorenko inequality to obtain general upper and lower bounds for homomorphism counts between arbitrary bipartite graphs. The upper bound is attained when the source is a disjoint union of complete bipartite graphs, and it admits a simple closed-form expression when the target contains no 4-cycles. Numerical results compare the proposed easy-to-compute bounds with exact counts in computationally tractable cases.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum and energy of graphs with self-loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph with self-loops $D_S$ with vertex set $\mathcal{V}$ is a simple digraph with a self-loop attached at every vertex in $S \subset \mathcal{V}.$ In this paper, we study the energy $E(D_S)$ of $D_S$ and its properties, which extend several classical results on simple directed graphs. If $D_1,...,D_k$ are the strong components of $D_S,$ we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for $E(D_S) \leq \sum^k_{i=1} E(D_i),$ for which the strict inequality exists for $S\neq \emptyset.$ We also provide several bounds and characterizations for the energy and spectral radius of $D_S,$ including the McClelland type bound. Lastly, we propose a notion of the complement of $D_S$ and establish some formulae describing the relationship between the energy and spectrum of regular digraphs with their complement.</description>

      <title>On the proportion of derangements in affine classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the proportion of derangements and of derangements of $p$-power order in the affine unitary group $AU_m(q)$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ of characteristic $p$. Both formulas rely on a result of independent interest concerning integer partitions: we obtain a generating function for partitions $\lambda=(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m)$ into $m$ parts, for which $\lambda_1=1$ or there exists $k \in \{2, \dots,m\}$ such that $\lambda_{k-1}&gt;\lambda_k=k$. Moreover, when $p$ is odd, we conjecture remarkably simple formulas for the proportions of derangements in the finite affine symplectic group $ASp_{2m}(q)$, and in the affine orthogonal groups $AO_{2m+1}(q)$ and $AO^{\pm}_{2m}(q)$, and we also propose conjectures for the proportions of derangements of $p$-power order. We further reduce the proofs of these conjectures to establishing three $q$-polynomial identities.</description>

Abstract: The distance eigenvalues of a connected graph $G$ are the eigenvalues of its distance matrix $D(G)$. A graph is called distance integral if all of its distance eigenvalues are integers. Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. The crown graph $Cr(n)$ is a graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ by removing a perfect matching. Let $L(Cr(n))$ denote the line graph of the crown graph $Cr(n)$. Using the equitable partition method, the set of distinct distance eigenvalues of the graph $L(Cr(n))$ has been determined which shows that this graph is distance integral [S.Morteza Mirafzal, The line graph of the crown graph is distance integral, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 71, no. 4 (2023): 662-672]. The distance spectrum of the graph $L(Cr(n))$ has not been found yet. In this paper, having the set of distance eigenvalues of $L(Cr(n))$ in the hand, we determine the distance spectrum of this graph.</description>

      <title>IP Models for Minimum Zero Forcing Sets, Forts, and Related Graph Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero forcing is a binary coloring game on a graph where a set of filled vertices can force non-filled vertices to become filled following a color change rule. In 2008, the zero forcing number of a graph was shown to be an upper bound on its maximum nullity. In addition, the combinatorial optimization problem for the zero forcing number was shown to be NP-hard. Since then, the study of zero forcing and its related parameters has received considerable attention. In 2018, the forts of a graph were defined as non-empty subsets of vertices where no vertex outside the set has exactly one neighbor in the set. Forts have been used to model zero forcing as an integer program and provide lower bounds on the zero forcing number. To date, three integer programming models have been developed for the zero forcing number of a graph: the Infection Model, Time Step Model, and Fort Cover Model. In this article, we present variations of these models for computing the zero forcing number and related graph parameters, such as the minimum and maximum propagation times, throttling number, and fractional zero forcing number. In addition, we present several new models for computing the realized propagation time interval, all minimal forts of a graph, and the fort number of a graph. We conclude with several numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our models when applied to small and medium order graphs. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence for several open conjectures regarding the propagation time interval, the number of minimal forts, the fort number, and the fractional zero forcing number of a graph.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds on Rainbow $k$-partite Matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$, $s$, and $k$ be positive integers. We say that a sequence $f_1,\dots,f_s$ of nonnegative integers is satisfying if for any collection of $s$ families $\mathcal F_1,\dots,\mathcal F_s\subseteq [n]^k$ such that $|\mathcal F_i|=f_i$ for all $i$, there exists a rainbow matching, i.e., a list of pairwise disjoint tuples $F_1\in\mathcal F_1$, $\dots$, $F_s\in\mathcal F_s$. We investigate the question, posed by Kupavskii and Popova, of determining the smallest $c=c(n,s,k)$ such that the arithmetic progression $c$, $n^{k-1}+c$, $2n^{k-1}+c$, $\dots$, $(s-1)n^{k-1}+c$ is satisfying. We prove that the sequence is satisfying for $c=\Omega_k(\max(s^2n^{k-2}, sn^{k-3/2}\sqrt{\log s}))$, improving the previous result by Kupavskii and Popova. We also study satisfying sequences for $k=2$ using the polynomial method, extending the previous result by Kupavskii and Popova to when $n$ is not prime.</description>

      <title>CR tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determinant of a tournament $T$ is defined as the determinant of the skew-adjacency matrix of $T$. For a positive odd integer $k$, let $\mathcal{D}_k$ be the set of tournaments whose all subtournaments have determinant at most $k^2$. Some existing results show that, for $k \in \{1,3,5\}$, a tournament $T \in \mathcal{D}_k \backslash \mathcal{D}_{k-2}$ ($T \in \mathcal{D}_1$ when $k=1$) if and only if $T$ is switching equivalent to a transitive blowup of $L_{k+1}$, where $L_{k+1}$ is a tournament of order $k+1$ with a specific structure.
  There exist some tournaments with the special property that adding any vertex that does not conform to their structure increases the maximum value of determinants among their subtournaments. We define these tournaments as CR tournaments. In this paper, we introduce CR tournaments, strong CR tournaments and basic tournaments, and show some properties and conclusions on these tournaments. For a basic strong CR tournament $H \in \mathcal{D}_{k} \backslash \mathcal{D}_{k-2}$, we show that if $T$ contains a subtournament which is switching isomorphic to $H$, then $T \in \mathcal{D}_{k} \backslash \mathcal{D}_{k-2}$ if and only if $T$ is switching equivalent to a transitive blowup of $H$. Moreover, we demonstrate that all $L_n$ are strong CR tournaments, and based on this conclusion, we answer a question posed in [J. Zeng, L. You, On determinants of tournaments and $\mathcal{D}_k$, arXiv:2408.06992, 2024.], and propose some questions for further research.</description>

      <title>Magical Property of Fullerenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fullerenes are an allotrope of carbon having hollow, cage-like structure. Atoms in the molecule are arranged in pentagonal and hexagonal rings, such that each atom is connected to three other atoms. Simple polyhedra having only pentagonal and hexagonal faces are a mathematical model for fullerenes. We say that a fullerene with $n$ vertices has magical property if the numbers $1, 2, \dots, n$ may be assigned to its vertices so that the sums of the numbers in each pentagonal faces are equal and the sums of the numbers in each hexagonal faces are equal. We show that $C_{8n+4}$ does not admit such an arrangement for all $n$, while there are fullerenes, like $C_{24}$ and $C_{26}$ that have many nonisomorphic such arrangements.</description>

      <title>Number of orbits of $k$-subsets of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group of order $n$. Say that two subsets $x, y\subseteq S_n$ are \emph{equivalent} if there exist permutations $g_1, g_2\in S_n$ such that $g_1xg_2=y$, where multiplication is understood elementwise. Recently, [Tripathi, 2024] and [Kushwaha and Triathi, 2025] asked for the asymptotics of $T(n,k)$, the number of subsets of $S_n$ of size $k$ up to this equivalence. It is easy to see that $T(n,0)=T(n, 1)=1$ and $T(n, 2)=p(n)-1$, where $p(n)$ is the number of integer partitions of $n$. In this work, we show that $T(n,k) = \Lambda_n(k)(1+o_n(1))$ for $3\leq k\leq n!-3$, where $\Lambda_n(k)=\frac{1}{n!^2}\binom{n!}{k}$. Furthermore, we prove that $$\frac{1}{\Lambda_n(n!/2)}T\!\left(n,\left[\sqrt{\tfrac{n!}{4}}x+\tfrac{n!}{2}\right]\right) ~\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}~ \exp\!\left(-\tfrac{x^2}{2}\right),$$ uniformly over $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>The exact Tur\'an number of generalized book graph $B_{r,k}$ in non-$r$-partite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H,$ we say that a graph is \textit{$H$-free} if it does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. The Tur\'an number $\ex(n,H)$ of $H$ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free graph, the set of all the corresponding extremal graphs is denoted by $\Ex(n, H)$. The study of Tur\'an number of graphs is a central topic in extremal graph theory. A graph is \textit{color-critical} if it contains an edge whose deletion reduces its chromatic number. Simonovits showed that if $H$ is a color-critical graph of chromatic number $r+1,$ then for sufficiently large $n,$ $\Ex(n, H)=\{T_r(n)\},$ the $r$-partite Tur\'an graph of order $n.$ Given a color-critical graph $H$ with chromatic number $r+1,$ it is interesting to determine $H$-free non-$r$-partite graphs with maximum number of edges. For a graph $H$ with chromatic number $r+1,$ denote $\ex_{r+1}(n,H)$ the maximum number of edges in non-$r$-partite $H$-free graphs of order $n,$ the set of all non-$r$-partite $H$-free graphs of order $n$ and size $\ex_{r+1}(n,H)$ is denoted by $\Ex_{r+1}(n, H)$. For $r\geq 3,\,k\geq1,$ the generalized book graph \({B}_{r,k}\) is a graph obtained by joining every vertex of $K_r$ to every vertex of an independent set of size \(k\). Note that \({B}_{r,k}\) is a color-critical graph of chromatic number $r+1.$ In this paper, based on the stability theory and local structure characterization, the exact value of $\ex_{r+1}(n,B_{r,k})$ is determined and all the corresponding extremal graphs are identified, where $r\geq 3,\,k\geq1$ and $n$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brouwer conjecture (BC) in spectral graph theory claims that the sum of the largest k Kirchhoff eigenvalues of a graph are bounded above by the number m of edges plus k(k+1)/2. We show that (BC) holds for all graphs with n vertices if n is larger or equal than 4 times the square of the maximal vertex degree. We also note that the weaker upper bound m+k(k+1) holds unconditionally. We also note that (BC) for graphs implies (BC) for quivers.</description>

      <title>Randomised algebraic constructions for the no-$(k+1)$-in-line problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The no-(k+1)-in line problem seeks the maximum number of points that can be selected from an $n \times n$ square lattice such that no $k+1$ of them are collinear. The problem was first posed more than $100$ years ago for the special case $k=2$ and has remained open ever since. The general problem was recently resolved in the case $k$ is not small compared to $n$, as Kov\'acs, Nagy and Szab\'o proved that the upper bound $kn$ can be attained, provided that $k&gt;C\sqrt{n\log{n}}$ for an absolute constant $C$.
  In this paper, we show that $\left(1-\tfrac{2}{k}\right)kn \leq f_k(n)\leq kn$ and $\left(1-\tfrac{3}{k}\right)kn \leq f_k(n)\leq kn$ hold for every even $k$ and odd $k$, respectively, provided that $n$ is large enough. This is asymptotically tight as $k\to \infty$. Previously, only $f_k(n)=\Omega(kn)$ was known due to Lefmann.
  We present further improvements on the lower bounds for constant values of $k$ when $k&lt;23$ holds. All these bounds are based on randomised algebraic constructions.</description>

This extends the known results for triangles and quadrilaterals to general $k$-gons and offers a clearer interpretation of the connection to products of $k$-bonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>Sufficient minimum degree conditions for the existence of highly connected or edge-connected subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mader conjectured that an average degree of at least $3k-1$ is sufficient for the existence of a $(k+1)$-connected subgraph. The following minimum degree version holds: Every graph with minimum degree at least $3k-1$ has a $(k+1)$-connected subgraph on more than $2k$ vertices. Moreover, for triangle-free graphs, already an average degree of at least $2k$ is sufficient for a $(k+1)$-connected subgraph (which has at least $2(k+1)$ vertices).
  For edge-connectedness (in simple graphs), we prove the following: Every graph of average degree at least $2k$ has a $(k+1)$-edge-connected subgraph on more than $2k$ vertices. Moreover, for every small $\alpha&gt;0$ and for $k$ large enough in terms of $\alpha$, already a minimum degree of at least $k+k^{\frac{1}{2}+\alpha} = \big(1+o(1)\big)k$ is sufficient for a $(k+1)$-edge-connected subgraph.
  It is shown that all of these results are sharp in some sense. The results can be used for the decomposition of graphs into two highly (edge-)connected parts.</description>

Abstract: We prove that graphs that do not contain a totally odd immersion of $K_t$ are $\mathcal{O}(t)$-colorable. In particular, we show that any graph with no totally odd immersion of $K_t$ is the union of a bipartite graph and a graph which forbids an immersion of $K_{\mathcal{O}(t)}$. Our results are algorithmic, and we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (in $t$) to find such a decomposition.</description>

      <title>On pairs of triangular numbers whose product is a perfect square and pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $\Pi = \Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $\Pi$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $\Pi$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</description>

      <title>Level-Rank Dualities for Finite Reductive Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an extended abstract of our work "Level-Rank Dualities from $\Phi$-Cuspidal Pairs..." We present evidence for a family of surprising coincidences within the representation theory of a finite reductive group $G$: more precisely, dualities between blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras attached by Brou\'e-Malle to $\Phi$-cuspidal pairs of $G$, where the Hecke parameters are specialized not to the order of the underlying finite field, but to roots of unity. For the groups $G = \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{F}_q)$, these coincidences can be expressed very concretely in terms of the combinatorics of partitions, and the whole story recovers an avatar of the level-rank duality studied by Frenkel, Uglov, Chuang-Miyachi, and others.</description>

      <title>The Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, Chevalley-Warning Theorem and weak Finitesatz in skew polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study zeros of polynomials in the multivariate skew polynomial ring $D[x_1,\ldots,x_n; \sigma]$, where $\sigma$ is an automorphism of a division ring $D$. We prove a generalization of Alon's celebrated Combinatorial Nullstellensatz for such polynomials. In the case where $D$ is a finite field, we prove skew analogues of the Chevalley--Warning theorem, Ax's Lemma, and the weak case of Terjanian's Finitesatz.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_{1}, ..., X_{n}$ be arbitrary non-negative independent random variables with respective expected values $\mu_{i}$ at most one and $\delta &gt; 0$. We prove Feige's Conjecture $\mathbb{P} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} &lt; \mu + \delta \right) \geq \min \left\{ \frac{\delta}{1 + \delta} \, , \, \exp \left(-1 \right) \right\}$, where $\mu$ is the expected value of the sum of the random variables. We show by a simple example how this inequality finds use in mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>Sparsifying Cayley Graphs on Every Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classic result in graph theory, due to Batson, Spielman, and Srivastava (STOC 2009) shows that every graph admits a $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$ cut (or spectral) sparsifier which preserves only $O(n / \varepsilon^2)$ reweighted edges. However, when applying this result to \emph{Cayley graphs}, the resulting sparsifier is no longer necessarily a Cayley graph -- it can be an arbitrary subset of edges.
  Thus, a recent line of inquiry, and one which has only seen minor progress, asks: for any group $G$, do all Cayley graphs over the group $G$ admit sparsifiers which preserve only $\mathrm{polylog}(|G|)/\varepsilon^2$ many re-weighted generators?
  As our primary contribution, we answer this question in the affirmative, presenting a proof of the existence of such Cayley graph spectral sparsifiers, along with an efficient algorithm for finding them. Our algorithm even extends to \emph{directed} Cayley graphs, if we instead ask only for cut sparsification instead of spectral sparsification.
  We additionally study the sparsification of linear equations over non-abelian groups. In contrast to the abelian case, we show that for non-abelian valued equations, super-polynomially many linear equations must be preserved in order to approximately preserve the number of satisfied equations for any input. Together with our Cayley graph sparsification result, this provides a formal separation between Cayley graph sparsification and sparsifying linear equations.</description>

      <title>Thomason-Type Model Structures on Simplicial Complexes and Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Matsushita model structure on loop graphs, which is right-transferred from the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets, factors through two other right-transferred model structures on simplicial complexes and reflexive graphs. We show that each Quillen adjunction between these right-transferred model categories is a Quillen equivalence. These model structures are analogous to the Thomason model structure on small categories, and we prove that they are all cofibrantly generated and proper. Furthermore we show that all cofibrant simplicial complexes are flag complexes, and all forests are cofibrant.</description>

      <title>Lattices in $\mathbb F_q[[T]]^d$ and spiral shifting operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the algebra and combinatorics of an analogue of the Hermite normal form that classifies finite-index submodules of $\mathbb F_q[[T]]^d$. We identity both normal forms as instances of Gr\"obner basis theory under different monomial orders, where the Hermite normal form corresponds to the lex order, and the new normal form the hlex order. We note that the hlex normal form recovers the Smith normal form, a feature not enjoyed by the Hermite normal form. We also identify the combinatorial structure underlying the cell decomposition induced by the hlex normal form, which appears to be of independent interest. Notably, the statistics tracking the cell dimensions is compatible, in a certain way, with a collection of $d$ ``spiral shifting operators'' on $\mathbb N^d$, which pairwise commute and collectively act freely and transitively. Using these operators, we give direct proofs of some new combinatorial identities obtained by translating the results of Solomon and Petrogradsky in terms of the hlex normal form.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hypergraphs and Some Invariant Subspaces of Matrices Associated with Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, the structural symmetries of a hypergraph are represented through equivalence relations on the vertex set of the hypergraph.
  A matrix associated with the hypergraph may not reflect a specific structural symmetry. In the context of a given symmetry within a hypergraph, we investigate a collection of matrices that encapsulate information about the symmetry. Our investigation reveals that certain structural symmetries in a hypergraph manifest observable effects on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of designated matrices associated with the hypergraph.
  We identify specific matrices where the invariance is a consequence of symmetries present in the hypergraph. These invariant subspaces elucidate analogous behaviours observed in certain clusters of vertices during random walks and other dynamical processes on the hypergraph.</description>

Abstract: The Sombor index is a topological index in graph theory defined by Gutman in 2021. In this article, we find the maximum Sombor index of trees of order $\mathbf{n}$ with a given dissociation number $\varphi$, where $\ceil*{\frac{2\mathbf{n}}{3}} \leq \varphi(G) \leq \mathbf{n}-1$. We also provide the unique graph among the chosen class where the maximum Sombor index is attained.</description>

      <title>On the $PGL_2(q)$-orbits of lines of $PG(3,q)$ and binary quartic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of classifying the lines of the projective $3$-space $PG(3,q)$ over a finite field $GF(q)$ into orbits of the group $G=PGL(2,q)$ of linear symmetries of the twisted cubic $C$. A generic line neither intersects $C$ nor lies in any of its osculating planes. While the non-generic lines have been classified into $G$-orbits in literature, it has been an open problem to classify the generic lines into $G$-orbits. For a general field $F$ of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$, the twisted cubic determines a symplectic polarity on $\mathbb P^3$. In the Klein representation of lines of $\mathbb P^3$, the tangent lines of $C$ are represented by a degree $4$ rational normal curve in a hyperplane $\mathcal H$ of the second exterior power $\mathbb P^5$ of $\mathbb P^3$. Atiyah studied the lines of $\mathbb P^3$ with respect to $C$, in terms of the geometries of these two curves. Polar duality of lines on $\mathbb P^3$ corresponds to Hodge duality on $\mathbb P^5$, and $\mathcal H$ is the hyperplane of Hodge self-dual elements of $\mathbb P^5$. We show that $\mathcal H$ can be identified in a $PGL_2$-equivariant way with the space of binary quartic forms over $F$, and that pairs of polar dual lines of $\mathbb P^3$ correspond to binary quartic forms whose apolar invariant is a square. We first solve the open problem of classifying binary quartic forms over $GF(q)$ into $G$-orbits, and then use it to solve the main problem.</description>

      <title>Extending Graph Burning to Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph burning is a round-based game or process that discretely models the spread of influence throughout a network. We introduce a generalization of graph burning which applies to hypergraphs, as well as a variant called ''lazy'' hypergraph burning. Interestingly, lazily burning a graph is trivial, while lazily burning a hypergraph can be quite complicated. Moreover, the lazy burning model is a useful tool for analyzing the round-based model. One of our key results is that arbitrary hypergraphs do not satisfy a bound analogous to the one in the Burning Number Conjecture for graphs. We also obtain bounds on the burning number and lazy burning number of a hypergraph in terms of its parameters, and present several open problems in the field of (lazy) hypergraph burning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns a construction of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences from right to left we call the generating tree growing on the left. We first apply this construction to inversion sequences avoiding 201 and 210, resulting in a new way of computing their generating function. We then use a slightly modified construction to compute the generating function of inversion sequences avoiding 010 and 102, which was only conjectured before. These generating functions are algebraic in both instances. We end by discussing how the generating tree growing on the left can be applied in a more general setting.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Transforming DAGs within the I-LCA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the connections between clusters and least common ancestors (LCAs) in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), focusing on the interplay between so-called $I$-lca-relevant DAGs and DAGs with the $I$-lca-property. Here, $I$ denotes a set of integers. In $I$-lca-relevant DAGs, each vertex is the unique LCA for some subset $A$ of leaves of size $|A|\in I$, whereas in a DAG with the $I$-lca-property there exists a unique LCA for every subset $A$ of leaves satisfying $|A|\in I$. We elaborate on the difference between these two properties and establish their close relationship to pre-$I$-ary and $I$-ary set systems. This, in turn, generalizes results established for (pre-)binary and $k$-ary set systems. Moreover, we build upon recently established results that use a simple operator $\ominus$, enabling the transformation of arbitrary DAGs into $I$-lca-relevant DAGs. This process reduces unnecessary complexity while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG. The set $C_G$ consists of all clusters in a DAG $G$, where clusters correspond to the descendant leaves of vertices. While in some cases $C_H = C_G$ when transforming $G$ into an $I$-lca-relevant DAG $H$, it often happens that certain clusters in $C_G$ do not appear as clusters in $H$. To understand this phenomenon in detail, we characterize the subset of clusters in $C_G$ that remain in $H$ for DAGs $G$ with the $I$-lca-property. Furthermore, we show that the set $W$ of vertices required to transform $G$ into $H = G \ominus W$ is uniquely determined for such DAGs. This, in turn, allows us to show that the ``shortcut-free'' version of the transformed DAG $H$ is always a tree or a galled-tree whenever $C_G$ represents the clustering system of a tree or galled-tree and $G$ has the $I$-lca-property. In the latter case $C_H = C_G$ always holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some combinatorial statistics defined on the set NC^{mton}(n) of monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions of {1,...,n}, and on the set NC_2^{mton}(2n) of monotonically ordered non-crossing pair-partitions of {1,...,2n}. A relevant point in our study is that the disjoint union of the NC^{mton}(n)'s has a natural tree structure, with good homogeneity properties, which can be used to produce recursions for the Laplace transforms of various random variables of interest. Unlike in the analogous results known for unordered non-crossing partitions, the computations of expectations and variances for natural block-counting statistics on NC^{mton}(n) and for the expectation of the area statistic on NC_2^{mton}(2n) turn out to yield a logarithmic regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ has a perfect division if its vertex set can be partitioned into two sets $A$, $B$ such that $G[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(G[B]) &lt; \omega(G)$. We call $G$ perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph of $G$ admits a perfect division. We prove that every ($P_2 \cup P_4$, bull)-free graph $G$ with $\omega(G) \geq 3$ has a perfect division if $G$ contains no homogeneous set. The clique-number condition is tight: a counterexample exists for $\omega(G) = 2$. Additionally, we present a short proof of the perfect divisibility of ($P_5$, bull)-free graphs, originally established by Chudnovsky and Sivaraman [J. Graph Theory 90 (2019), 54-60.].</description>

Abstract: The rich and varied ways that genetic material can be passed between species has motivated extensive research into the theory of phylogenetic networks. Features that align with biological processes, or with desirable mathematical properties, have been used to define classes and prove results, with the goal of developing the theoretical foundations for network reconstruction methods. We may have now reached the point where a collection of recent results can be drawn together to make one class of network, the \emph{normal} networks, a leading contender, sitting in the sweet spot between biological relevance and mathematical tractability.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms of (n,m)-graphs with respect to generalised switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs, that is, adjacency preserving vertex mappings of graphs with $n$ types of arcs and $m$ types of edges was initiated by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Raspaud in 2000. Later, some attempts were made to generalize the switch operation that is popularly used in the study of signed graphs, and study its effect on the above mentioned homomorphism.
  In this article, we too provide a generalization of the switch operation on $(n,m)$-graphs, which to the best of our knowledge, encapsulates all the previously known generalizations as special cases. We approach the study of homomorphisms with respect to the switch operation axiomatically. We prove some fundamental results that are essential tools in the further study of this topic. In the process of proving the fundamental results, we have provided yet another solution to an open problem posed by Klostermeyer and MacGillivray in 2004. We also prove the existence of a categorical product for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to a particular class of generalized switch which implicitly uses category theory. This is a counter intuitive solution as the number of vertices in the Categorical product of two $(n,m)$-graphs on $p$ and $q$ vertices has a multiple of $pq$ many vertices, where the multiple depends on the switch. This solves an open question asked by Brewster in the PEPS 2012 workshop as a corollary. We also provide a way to calculate the product explicitly, and prove general properties of the product. We define the analog of chromatic number for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to generalized switch and explore the interrelations between chromatic numbers with respect to different switch operations. We find the value of this chromatic number for the family of forests using group theoretic notions.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Majority Dynamics on Binomial Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study information aggregation in networks when agents interact to learn a binary state of the world. Initially each agent privately observes an independent signal which is "correct" with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\delta$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$. At each round, a node is selected uniformly at random to update their public opinion to match the majority of their neighbours (breaking ties in favour of their initial private signal). Our main result shows that for sparse and connected binomial random graphs $\mathcal G(n,p)$ the process stabilizes in a "correct" consensus in $\mathcal O(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$ steps with high probability. In fact, when $\log n/n \ll p = o(1)$ the process terminates at time $\hat T = (1+o(1))n\log n$, where $\hat T$ is the first time when all nodes have been selected at least once. However, in dense binomial random graphs with $p=\Omega(1)$, there is an information cascade where the process terminates in the "incorrect" consensus with probability bounded away from zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix an integer $h \geq 2$, and let $b_1, \ldots, b_h$ be (not necessarily distinct) positive integers with $\gcd(b_1, \ldots, b_h) = 1$. For any subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, let $r_A(n)$ denote the number of solutions $(k_1, \ldots, k_h) \in A^h$ to the equation \[ b_1 k_1 + \cdots + b_h k_h = n. \] Given a function $F$ satisfying $F(n) \leq r_{\mathbb{N}}(n)$, we ask: when does there exist a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $r_A(n) \sim F(n)$? We prove that this is always possible when $F$ is regularly varying and satisfies $\lim_{n\to\infty} F(n)/\log n = \infty$.
  If one only requires $r_A(n) \asymp F(n)$, much weaker regularity conditions suffice: we show such a set $A$ exists for every increasing function $F$ satisfying $F(2x) \ll F(x)$ and either \[ \log x \ll F(x) \ll x^{\frac{1}{h-1}} \quad \text{or} \quad (\log x)^{2h^2} \ll F(x) \ll x^{h-1}. \] Finally, we give a probabilistic heuristic supporting the following: if $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $\limsup_{n\to\infty} r_A(n)/\log n &lt; 1$, then $r_A(n) = 0$ for infinitely many $n$.</description>

      <title>Real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rational Betti numbers of real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra. We consider the poset topology of a specific poset induced from a chordal building set, and show its EL-shellability. Based on this, we present an explicit description using alternating $\mathcal{B}$-permutations for a chordal building set $\mathcal{B}$, transforming the computing Betti numbers into a counting problem. This approach allows us to compute the $a$-number of a finite simple graph through permutation counting when the graph is chordal. In addition, we provide detailed computations for specific cases such as real Hochschild varieties corresponding to Hochschild polytopes.</description>

      <title>The v-numbers and linear presentations of ideals of covers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $J=I_c(G)$ be its ideal of covers. The aims of this work are to study the {\rm v}-number ${\rm v}(J)$ of $J$ and to study when $J$ is linearly presented using combinatorics and commutative algebra. We classify when ${\rm v}(J)$ attains its minimum and maximum possible values in terms of the vertex covers of the graph that satisfy the exchange property. If the cover ideal of a graph has a linear presentation, we express its v-number in terms of the covering number of the graph. If $G$ is unmixed, the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ is the graph whose vertices are the minimal vertex covers of $G$ and whose edges are the pairs $\{C,C'\}$ such that $|C\cup C'|=|C|+1$. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ to be connected. Then, for unmixed K\"onig graphs, we classify when $J$ is linearly presented using graph theory, and show some results on Cohen--Macaulay K\"onig graphs. If $G$ is unmixed, it is shown that the columns of the linear syzygy matrix of $J$ are linearly independent if and only if $\mathcal{G}_J$ has no strong $3$-cycles. One of our main theorems shows that if $G$ is unmixed and has no induced $4$-cycles, then $J$ is linearly presented. For unmixed graphs without $3$- and $5$-cycles, we classify combinatorially when $J$ is linearly presented.</description>

      <title>A Direct Proof of the Short-Side Advantage in Random Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stable matching problem under the random matching model where the preferences of the doctors and hospitals are sampled uniformly and independently at random. In a balanced market with $n$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm gives doctors an expected rank of order $\log n$ for their partners and hospitals an expected rank of order $\frac{n}{\log n}$ for their partners. This situation is reversed in an unbalanced market with $n+1$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, a phenomenon known as the short-side advantage. The current proofs of this fact are indirect, counter-intuitively being based upon analyzing the hospital-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. In this paper we provide a direct proof of the short-side advantage, explicitly analyzing the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. Our proof sheds light on how and why the phenomenon arises.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme minimal cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). More generally, we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for this family of polynomials and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets. We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the first theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set.</description>

      <title>The maximal rank of a string group generated by involutions for alternating groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A string group generated by involutions, or SGGI, is a pair $\Gamma=(G, S)$, where $G$ is a group and $S=\{\rho_0,\ldots, \rho_{r-1}\}$ is an ordered set of involutions generating $G$ and satisfying the commuting property: $$\forall i,j\in\{0,\ldots, r-1\}, \;|i-j|\ne 1\Rightarrow (\rho_i\rho_j)^2=1.$$ When $S$ is an independent set, the rank of $\Gamma$ is the cardinality of $S$. We determine an upper bound for the rank of an SGGI over the alternating group of degree $n$. Our bound is tight when $n\equiv 0,1,4\pmod 5$.</description>

Abstract: We give a nonnegative step function with 575 equally spaced intervals such that $$\frac{\|f \ast f\|_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R})}^{2}}{\|f \ast f\|_{L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})}\|f \ast f\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb{R})}} \geq 0.901564.$$ This improves upon a recent result of Deepmind's AlphaEvolve, which found a nonnegative step function with 50 equally space intervals for which the left hand side is $\geq 0.8962$. Our function was found using simulated annealing and gradient based methods rather than using large language models.</description>

      <title>Metric dimension reduction modulus for superlogarithmic distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metric dimension reduction modulus $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ is the smallest $k$ such that every $n$--point metric space can be embedded into some $k$-dimensional normed space, with bi--Lipschitz distortion at most $\alpha$. Determining sharp asymptotics for $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ is a fundamental task in metric geometry, with $\alpha=\Theta(\log n)$ bearing particular interest. A line of advances over the past decades has led to an upper bound on $k^{\alpha}_n(\ell_\infty)$ for $\alpha = \Omega(\log n)$, but a matching lower bound has remained open. We close this gap, establishing: for every fixed $\beta &gt; 0$, $$ k^{\alpha}_n(\ell_\infty) =\Theta\bigg(\frac{\log n}{\log(\frac{\alpha}{\log n}+1)}\bigg)\quad \mbox{for every $\alpha\geq \beta \log n$}. $$ This resolves a question from Naor's 2018 ICM plenary lecture. Our result is obtained by characterizing the minimum dimension $d$ for which, with high probability, a random regular graph admits an $\alpha$--embedding into some $d$--dimensional normed space.</description>

      <title>Heights of butterfly trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures whose performance is largely governed by tree height. We introduce a block model for constructing BSTs by embedding internal BSTs into the nodes of an external BST -- a structure motivated by parallel data architectures -- corresponding to composite permutations formed via Kronecker or wreath products. Extending Devroye's result that the height $h_n$ of a random BST satisfies $h_n / \log n \to c^* \approx 4.311$, we show that block BSTs with $nm$ nodes and fixed external size $m$ satisfy $h_{n,m} / \log n \to c^* + h_m$ in distribution. We then study butterfly trees: BSTs generated from permutations built using iterated Kronecker or wreath products. For simple butterfly trees (from iterated Kronecker products of $S_2$), we give a full distributional description showing polynomial height growth: $\mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} = \Theta(N^\alpha)$ with $\alpha = \log_2(3/2) \approx 0.58496$. For nonsimple butterfly trees (from wreath products), we prove power-law bounds: $cN^\alpha\cdot (1 + o(1)) \le \mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} \le dN^\beta\cdot (1 + o(1))$, with $\beta \approx 0.913189$.</description>
