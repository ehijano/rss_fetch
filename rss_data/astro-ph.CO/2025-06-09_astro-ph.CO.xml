      <title>Galaxy cluster count cosmology with simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance and mass distribution of galaxy clusters is a sensitive probe of cosmological parameters, through the sensitivity of the high-mass end of the halo mass function to $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. While galaxy cluster surveys have been used as cosmological probes for more than a decade, the accuracy of cluster count experiments is still hampered by systematic, such as the relation between observables and halo mass, the accuracy of the halo mass function, and the survey selection function. Here we show that these uncertainties can be alleviated by forward modeling the observed cluster population with simulation-based inference. We construct a pipeline that predicts the distribution of observables from cosmological parameters and scaling relations, and then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the input parameters and the measured distributions. We focus on fiducial X-ray surveys with available flux, temperature, and redshift measurements, although the method can be easily adapted to any available observable. We apply our method to mock samples extracted from the UNIT1i simulation and demonstrate the accuracy of our approach. We then study the impact of several systematic uncertainties on the recovered cosmological parameters. We show that sample variance and the choice of the halo mass function are subdominant sources of uncertainty. Conversely, the absolute mass scale is the leading source of systematic error and must be calibrated at the $&lt;10\%$ level to recover accurate values of $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. However, the quantity $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.3}$ appears to be less sensitive to the accuracy of the mass calibration. We conclude that simulation-based inference is a promising avenue for future cosmological studies from galaxy cluster surveys such as eROSITA and Euclid as it allows to consider all the available observables in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>A Reassessment of the Pantheon+ and DES 5YR Calibration Uncertainties: Dovekie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are crucial tools to measure the accelerating expansion of the universe, comprising thousands of SNe across multiple telescopes. Accurate measurements of cosmological parameters with SNe Ia require a robust understanding and cross-calibration of the telescopes and filters. A previous cross-calibration effort, 'Fragilistic', provided 25 photometric systems, but offered no public code or ability to add new surveys. We provide an open-source cross-calibration solution, available at https://github.com/bap37/Dovekie/ . Using the Pan-STARRs (PS1) and Gaia all-sky telescopes, we characterise the measured filters from 11 photometric systems, including CfA, PS1, Foundation, DES, CSP, SDSS, and SNLS, using published observations of field stars. For the first time, we derive uncertainties on effective filter transmissions and modify filters to match the data. With the addition of direct observations of DA white dwarfs (Boyd et al. 2025), we simultaneously cross-calibrate our zeropoints across photometric systems and propagate to cosmology. With improved uncertainties from DA WDs, we find improvements to the calibration systematic uncertainty of x1.5 for the Pantheon+ (Brout et al. 2022) sample with a new systematic photometric uncertainty = 0.016 for FlatwCDM, and modest improvements to that of the DES5YR analysis. We find good agreement with previous calibration, and show that even these small calibration changes can be amplified by up to a factor of x6 in the inferred SN Ia distances, driven by calibration sensitivity in the colour-luminosity relations and SALT training. Initial results indicate that these changes cause dmu/dz = 0.025 and change the recovered value of Omega_M in LCDM by ~0.01. These may have a potentially larger impact in w0/wa space and inferences about evolving dark energy. We pursue this calculation in an ongoing full re-analysis of DES.</description>

      <title>Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative observational data analysis of two DBI-type k-essence scalar field models for late-time cosmic acceleration: one treats dark energy with standard matter, while the other unifies dark energy and dark matter within a single scalar field, each governed by distinct non-canonical Lagrangians. The background dynamics are formulated via modified Friedmann and scalar field equations, constrained by Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO data, using Bayesian inference (NUTS in NumPyro) and a neural network-based emulator for efficiency. Introducing a nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ improves the robustness and interpretability of key cosmological parameters, particularly $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\Omega_{d0}$ by absorbing residual systematics, thereby mitigating the Hubble tension. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is computed for both models, revealing key differences in cosmic acceleration history: Model I yields a present value $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.589$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.559$ with transition redshift $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.740$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.686$, closely aligning with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, while Model II shows a stronger present acceleration $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.893$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.819$ but with a later transition at $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.605$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.564$, indicating a steeper late time evolution. Based on $\chi^2$, $\chi^2_\nu$, AIC, and BIC statics, Model II performs worse than Model I despite its conceptual appeal. Finally, Symbolic regression (GPlearn) is performed to reconstructs $\omega_{eff}(z)$. Our analysis shows that Model I is statistically favored across all metrics and offers a physically consistent alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, capable of addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The polarization of strongly lensed point-like radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The magnetized medium induces birefringence, splitting the light into two distinct wave modes. The differing propagation speeds of the two modes result in different trajectories. Strong gravitational lensing amplifies the birefringence and introduces an additional geometric rotation on top of the Faraday rotation. We compare the geometric rotation with the Faraday rotation. Methods. We construct the lens equation for massive objects in a magnetized plasma environment, and calculate the time delay difference between the two modes using two toy examples. We present that in the strong lensed radio sources, birefringence causes geometric rotation, which is a non-negligible effect, even with a weak magnetic field. Results. In both examples, the geometric delay causes a comparable or stronger rotation than the Faraday rotation and show a similar dependence on the wavelength of the signal. For a point lens with a strong magnetic field, the two wave modes exhibit distinct behaviours. The polarization of lensed sources can provide additional insights into the magnetic field and plasma environment.</description>

      <title>Smoking gun signature from axion and the constraints with radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are an elegant solution to the strong CP problem for particle physics and a promising dark matter candidate. They can convert into photons under a strong magnetic field, while magnetars with extreme magnetic fields are natural labs for axion detection. Radio telescopes can detect the radio emission from axion-photon conversion near magnetars. In this study, we have refined the calculation of axion-photon conversion and developed the matched filtering integration method to largely improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We validate our method using end-to-end simulation and real observational data from TMRT. A new constraint is set with only 687 seconds of observations with TMRT. Using 10 hours of observation with the high-frequency receiver in FAST or SKA, we can reach the theoretical coupling constant prediction for the axion mass range from 1$\mu$eV to 100$\mu$eV. We validate the possibility of axion detection with radio telescopes and avoid spectrum confusion.</description>

      <title>Features of the Spatial Distribution of Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistical analysis of anisotropic quasiperiodic features of the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters obtained on the basis of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts in the interval $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.47$ has been carried out. Based on data from the SDSS~III catalog, we show that the preferential direction previously detected in the northern hemisphere (a narrow cone of directions: $\alpha_0=170^\circ \pm 5^\circ, \ \delta_0= 29^\circ \pm 5^\circ$), along which the one-dimensional distribution of projections of the Cartesian coordinates of clusters contains a significant ($\gtrsim (4 - 5) \sigma$) quasi-periodic component, can also be found using photometric redshifts, achieving a certain accuracy ($\Delta z \lesssim 0.013$). Based on data from the photometric DES$\times$unWISE catalog, we have analyzed the spatial distribution of clusters in the southern hemisphere, where a cone of close directions was also detected ($\alpha_0=346^\circ \pm 5^\circ,\ \delta_0= - 29^\circ \pm 5^\circ $), which are approximately an extention of the directions revealed in the northern hemisphere. The power spectra of one-dimensional distributions along these directions contain significant ($\gtrsim (4 - 5) \sigma$) features in the same interval of wave numbers $0.04 \lesssim k \lesssim 0.06~h$~Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and the First Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute a compelling dark matter candidate whose gravitational effects could significantly influence early cosmic structure formation. We investigate the impact of PBHs on Population III star formation through detailed $N$-body and hydrodynamic simulations, extending beyond previous semi-analytical approaches. Our results reveal a mass-dependent dichotomy in PBH effects: massive PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^2 M_\odot$) with sufficient abundance can accelerate structure formation and shift Pop III formation to higher redshifts, potentially conflicting with observational constraints from high-redshift galaxy surveys. Conversely, lower-mass PBHs can induce tidal disruption of gas-rich minihalos, suppressing star formation and delaying the cosmic dawn depending on their abundance. We quantify these competing effects to derive new constraints on the PBH mass function and their contribution to the total dark matter density, with implications for forthcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and 21-cm cosmology experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetogenesis from Sawtooth Coupling: Gravitational Wave Probe of Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO-Virgo and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened a new window into early universe cosmology. Yet, the origin of large-scale magnetic fields and the dynamics of the reheating epoch remain poorly understood. In this work, we study the generation of secondary GWs (SGWs) sourced by primordial magnetic fields produced via a Sawtooth-type coupling during reheating with a general background evolution. We show that the reheating equation of state significantly influences the spectral shape and amplitude of the magnetic fields. While a scale-invariant spectrum is typically needed to match observational bounds, this coupling naturally produces a strongly blue-tilted spectrum that remains consistent with current constraints. Crucially, the magnetic field continues to grow during reheating, leading to a GW signal with a broken power-law spectrum and a distinctive blue tilt on super-horizon scales. This SGW signal can fall within the sensitivity of upcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. The unique spectral features make this scenario distinguishable from other sources, offering a viable mechanism for cosmic magnetogenesis and a novel probe of the reheating era through GW observations.</description>

      <title>Accurate $N$-body simulations with local Primordial non-Gaussianities: initial conditions and aliasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New generation galaxy surveys targeting constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) demand $N$-body simulations that accurately reproduce its effects. In this work, we explore various prescriptions for the initial conditions of simulations with PNG, aiming to optimise accuracy and minimise numerical errors, particularly due to aliasing. We have used $186$ runs that vary the starting redshift, LPT order, and non-Gaussianities ($f^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$ and $g^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$). Starting with $3$LPT at a redshift as low as $z_{\rm ini}\simeq 11.5$ reproduces to $&lt;1 \%$ the power spectrum, bispectrum and halo mass function of a high-resolution reference simulation. The aliasing induced by the PNG terms in the power spectrum produces a $ \leq 3 \%$ excess small-scale power at the initial conditions, dropping below $0.1\%$ by $z=0$. State-of-the-art initial condition generators show a sub-percent agreement. We show that initial conditions for simulations with PNG should be established at a lower redshift using higher-order LPT schemes. We also show that removing the PNG aliasing signal is unnecessary for current simulations. The methodology proposed here can accelerate the generation of simulations with PNG while enhancing their accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of redMaPPer Galaxy Clusters with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical galaxy cluster identification algorithms such as redMaPPer promise to enable an array of astrophysical and cosmological studies, but suffer from biases whereby galaxies in front of and behind a galaxy cluster are mistakenly associated with the primary cluster halo. These projection effects caused by irreducible photometric uncertainty must be quantified to facilitate the use of optical cluster catalogues. We present measurements of galaxy cluster projection effects and velocity dispersion using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Representative data from DESI enables characterizing these properties of clusters identified with the redMaPPer algorithm. Our findings are as follows: we confirm that the fraction of redMaPPer putative member galaxies mistakenly associated with cluster haloes is richness dependent, being more than twice as large at low richness than high richness; we present the first spectroscopic evidence of an increase in projection effects with increasing redshift, by as much as 25 per cent from $z\sim0.1$ to $z\sim0.2$; moreover, we find qualitative evidence for luminosity dependence in projection effects, with fainter galaxies being more commonly far behind clusters than their bright counterparts; finally we fit the scaling relation between measured mean spectroscopic richness and velocity dispersion, finding an implied linear scaling between spectroscopic richness and halo mass. We discuss further directions for the application of spectroscopic datasets to improve use of optically selected clusters to test cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>To collapse or not to collapse: Halo evolution with self-interacting dark matter mass segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase, where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe which typical SIDM models are subject to. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM model consisting of two species with unequal masses, featuring only interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing $N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, the mass segregation caused by the unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species models, offering a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Power Spectrum Foreground Model and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the model of astrophysical emission at millimeter wavelengths used to characterize foregrounds in the multi-frequency power spectra of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6), expanding on Louis et al. (2025). We detail several tests to validate the capability of the DR6 parametric foreground model to describe current observations and complex simulations, and show that cosmological parameter constraints are robust against model extensions and variations. We demonstrate consistency of the model with pre-DR6 ACT data and observations from Planck and the South Pole Telescope. We evaluate the implications of using different foreground templates and extending the model with new components and/or free parameters. In all scenarios, the DR6 $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$ cosmological parameters shift by less than $0.5\sigma$ relative to the baseline constraints. Some foreground parameters shift more; we estimate their systematic uncertainties associated with modeling choices. From our constraint on the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power, we obtain a conservative limit on the duration of reionization of $\Delta z_{\rm rei} &lt; 4.4$, assuming a reionization midpoint consistent with optical depth measurements and a minimal low-redshift contribution, with varying assumptions for this component leading to tighter limits. Finally, we analyze realistic non-Gaussian, correlated microwave sky simulations containing Galactic and extragalactic foreground fields, built independently of the DR6 parametric foreground model. Processing these simulations through the DR6 power spectrum and likelihood pipeline, we recover the input cosmological parameters of the underlying cosmic microwave background field, a new demonstration for small-scale CMB analysis. These tests validate the robustness of the ACT DR6 foreground model and cosmological parameter constraints.</description>

      <title>Survival of dust in super-dusty galaxies at redshifts $z \approx 5-8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of dust in galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;5$ is commonly connected with core collapse supernovae (SN). Galaxies with exceptionally large dust mass, of order of $1 - 3$\% of the galaxy stellar mass, have been detected during the last decade. The required SN dust yield is $\gtrsim 1~M_\odot$ per supernova, which is comparable to the theoretically predicted maximum. However, the reverse shock (RS) penetrating the SN ejecta significantly destroy the dust particles nucleating there through sputtering. The resulting net dust mass injected into the interstellar gas after processing by the RS turns out to be $\lesssim 0.1~M_\odot$ per SN. This makes the explanation of the existence of $z&gt;5$ galaxies with dust masses as high as $M_d\gtrsim (0.01-0.03)M_\ast$ a challenging one. In this paper we present arguments in favor of an efficient inhibition of the sputtering behind the RS, caused by a strong radiation cooling from the dust in the supernova ejecta.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting II -- High-resolution spectroscopy with the X-ray Integral Field Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray spectral fitting in high-energy astrophysics can be reliably accelerated using Machine Learning. In particular, Simulation-based Inference (SBI) produces accurate posterior distributions in the Gaussian and Poisson regime for low-resolution spectra, much faster than other exact approaches such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains or Nested Sampling. We now aim to highlight the capabilities of SBI for high-resolution spectra, as what will be provided by the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU). The large number of channels encourages us to use compressed representations of the spectra, taking advantage of the likelihood-free inference aspect of SBI. Two compression schemes are explored, using either simple summary statistics, such as the counts in arbitrary bins or ratios between these bins. We benchmark the efficiency of these approaches using simulated X-IFU spectra with various spectral models, including smooth comptonised spectra, relativistic reflexion models and plasma emission models. We find that using simple and meaningful summary statistics is much more efficient than working directly with the full spectrum, and can derive posterior distributions comparable to those from exact computation using nested sampling. Multi-round inference converges quickly to the good solution. Amortized single round inference requires more simulations, hence longer training time, but can be used to infer model parameters from many observations afterwards. Information from the emission lines must be accounted for using dedicated summary statistics. SBI for X-ray spectral fitting is a robust technique that delivers well calibrated posteriors. This approach shows great promises for high-resolution spectra, offering its potential for the scientific exploitation of the X-IFU. We now plan to apply it to the current era of high-resolution telescopes, and further challenge this approach with real data.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe, (pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies. We also discuss their implications for transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The one-loop bispectrum of galaxies in redshift space from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the kernels and the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure counterterms for the one-loop bispectrum of dark matter and of biased tracers in real and redshift space. This requires the expansion of biased tracers up to fourth order in fluctuations. In the process, we encounter several subtleties related to renormalization. One is the fact that, in renormalizing the momentum, a local counterterm contributes non-locally. A second subtlety is related to the renormalization of local products of the velocity fields, which need to be expressed in terms of the renormalized velocity in order to preserve Galilean symmetry. We check that the counterterms we identify are necessary and sufficient to renormalize the one-loop bispectrum at leading and subleading order in the derivative expansion. The kernels that we originally present here have already been used for the first analyses of the one-loop bispectrum in BOSS data [1, 2].</description>

      <title>Halo Formation from Yukawa Forces in the Very Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where dark matter fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, dark stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at matter-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.</description>

      <title>Neural network prediction of model parameters for strong lensing samples from Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong lensing of background galaxies provides important information about the matter distribution around lens galaxies. Traditional modelling of such strong lenses is both time and resource intensive. Fast and automated analysis methods are the need of the hour given large upcoming surveys. In this work, we build and train a simple convolutional neural network with an aim of rapidly predicting model parameters of gravitational lenses. We focus on the inference of the Einstein radius, and ellipticity components of the mass distribution. We train our network on a variety of simulated data with increasing degree of realism and compare its performance on simulated test data in a quantitative manner. We also model 182 gravitational lenses from the HSC survey using {\sc YattaLens} pipeline to infer their model parameters, which allow a benchmark to compare the predictions of the network. Given all considerations, we conclude that the network trained on simulated samples with lensed sources injected in empty HSC cutouts is the most robust, reproducing Einstein radii with an accuracy of about $10-20$ percent, a bias less than 5 percent, and an outlier fraction of the order of 10 percent. We argue in favour of the subtraction of the lens light before modelling the lens mass distribution. Our comparisons of the inferred parameters of 10 HSC lenses previously modelled in the literature, demonstrate agreement on the Einstein radius. However, the ellipticity components from the network as well as the individual modelling methods, seem to have systematic uncertainties beyond the quoted errors.</description>

      <title>Emulating the Lyman-Alpha forest 1D power spectrum from cosmological simulations: New models and constraints from the eBOSS measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Lyssa suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest designed for cosmological analyses. These 18 simulations have been run using the Nyx code with $4096^3$ hydrodynamical cells in a 120 Mpc ($\sim$ 81Mpc/h) comoving box and individually provide sub-percent level convergence of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1d flux power spectrum. We build a Gaussian process emulator for the Lyssa simulations in the lym1d likelihood framework to interpolate the power spectrum at arbitrary parameter values. We validate this emulator based on leave-one-out tests and based on the parameter constraints for simulations outside of the training set. We also perform comparisons with a previous emulator, showing a percent level accuracy and a good recovery of the expected cosmological parameters. Using this emulator we derive constraints on the linear matter power spectrum amplitude and slope parameters $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ and $n_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$. While the best-fit Planck $\Lambda$CDM model has $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=8.79$ and $n_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=-2.363$, from DR14 eBOSS data we find that $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}&lt;7.6$ (95\% CI) and $n_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=-2.369 \pm 0.008$. The low value of $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$, in tension with Planck, is driven by the correlation of this parameter with the mean transmission of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. This tension disappears when imposing a well-motivated external prior on this mean transmission, in which case we find $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=9.8\pm1.1$ in accordance with Planck.</description>

      <title>A Measurement of the Largest-Scale CMB E-mode Polarization with CLASS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present measurements of large-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) E-mode polarization from the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) 90 GHz data. Using 115 det-yr of observations collected through 2024 with a variable-delay polarization modulator, we achieved a polarization sensitivity of $78\,\mathrm{\mu K\,arcmin}$, comparable to Planck at similar frequencies (100 and 143 GHz). The analysis demonstrates effective mitigation of systematic errors and addresses challenges to large-angular-scale power recovery posed by time-domain filtering in maximum-likelihood map-making. A novel implementation of the pixel-space transfer matrix is introduced, which enables efficient filtering simulations and bias correction in the power spectrum using the quadratic cross-spectrum estimator. Overall, we achieved an unbiased time-domain filtering correction to recover the largest angular scale polarization, with the only power deficit, arising from map-making non-linearity, being characterized as less than $3\%$. Through cross-correlation with Planck, we detected the cosmic reionization at $99.4\%$ significance and measured the reionization optical depth $\tau=0.053^{+0.018}_{-0.019}$, marking the first ground-based attempt at such a measurement. At intermediate angular scales ($\ell&gt;30$), our results, both independently and in cross-correlation with Planck, remain fully consistent with Planck's measurements.</description>

Abstract: In the near future, the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will obtain unprecedented imaging and spectroscopic data. The statistical errors in the cosmological parameter constraints will be reduced significantly. The corresponding theoretical tools must meet the percent-level accuracy required to extract as much cosmological information as possible from the observations. We present the CSST Emulator to provide nonlinear power spectrum predictions in the eight cosmological parameter space $\Omega_\mathrm{cb},\Omega_\mathrm{b},H_{0},n_{s},A_{s},w_{0}, w_{a}$, and $m_\nu$. It is constructed based on the Kun simulation suite, consisting of 129 high-resolution simulations with box size $L=1\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ and evolving $3072^3$ particles. The determinations of parameter ranges, sampling method, and emulation strategy in the whole construction have been optimized exquisitely. This enables our prediction for $k\leq 10\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2.0$ to reach $1\%$ accuracy validated through internal and external simulations. We also compare our results with recent BACCO, EuclidEmulator2, and Mira-Titan IV emulators, which demonstrate the CSST Emulator's excellent performance across a wide cosmological parameter range in the nonlinear regime. CSST Emulator is publicly released at https://github.com/czymh/csstemu, and provides a fundamental theoretical tool for accurate cosmological inference with future CSST observations.</description>

      <title>Polarization Properties of the Electromagnetic Response to High-frequency Gravitational Wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves (EMWs) can be generated by gravitational waves (GWs) within a magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein effect. The conversion probability between GWs and EMWs can be enhanced by inhomogeneities in the electron density and magnetic field within the magnetized plasma of both the Milky Way (MW) and the intergalactic medium in the expanding Universe. Polarized GWs can induce polarized EMWs, and the polarization properties of these EMWs can be altered by Faraday rotation as they propagate through magnetized plasma. Additionally, the polarization intensity of the EMWs may be weakened due to depolarization effects. In this study, we calculate the enhanced GW-EMW conversion in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma during the propagation of GWs through the Universe and our galaxy. We analyze the polarization states of the EMWs generated by polarized GWs and discuss the depolarization effects induced by the medium's irregularities, as well as the differential Faraday rotation occurring in multilayer polarized radiation. Our work provides alternative methods for detecting GWs and exploring their polarization states, and potentially constraining the parameters of the possible GW sources, especially the primordial black hole, contributing to the advancement of very-high-frequency GW detection and research.</description>

      <title>Probing the Bounce Energy Scale in Bouncing Cosmologies with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

Abstract: In this work we constrain the bounce energy scale $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ in a generic framework of bouncing cosmologies using the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav 15-yr, EPTA DR2, PPTA DR3, IPTA DR2). A full Bayesian fit of the analytic SGWB spectrum for this bounce scenario reveals, for the first time, two distinct posterior branches in $(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4},w_1)$: one near $w_1\approx0.3$ and one at $w_1\gg1$, where $w_1$ is the contraction phase equation of state. We find that the bouncing model attains larger Bayes factors against each of six conventional SGWB sources (SMBHBs, inflationary GWs, cosmic strings, domain walls, first order phase transitions, scalar induced GWs), demonstrating strong preference of current PTA data for the bounce hypothesis. Compared to the more generic dual inflation bounce scenario, the concrete bounce realization yields smaller Bayes factors, indicating that PTA measurements impose tighter constraints when the bounce scale is explicit. Moreover, the two posterior branches illuminate distinct theoretical frontiers. The right branch ($w_1\gg1$) violates the dominant energy condition (DEC), thereby providing direct empirical impetus for models with novel early Universe physics, e.g. ghost condensates, higher-derivative or modified gravity operators, and extra dimensional effects. Independently, both branches infer $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ above the Planck scale $M_\mathrm{pl}$, demonstrating that current PTAs already probe trans-Planckian regimes. Together, these findings offer a rare observational window into UV completions of cosmology. We further describe how normalizing flow based machine learning can accelerate such Bayesian analyses as PTA data volumes increase.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Reconstruction of f(T) Gravity Using Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use genetic algorithms, a specific machine learning technique, to achieve a model-independent reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity. By using $H(z)$ data derived from cosmic chronometers and radial Baryon Acoustic Oscillation method, including the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data, we reconstruct the Hubble rate which is the basis parameter for reconstructing $f(T)$ gravity without any assumptions. In this reconstruction process, we use the current value of the Hubble rate, $H_0$, derived by genetic algorithms. The reconstructed $f(T)$ function is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level across a broad temporal range. The mean $f(T)$ curve, adopting a quadratic form, prompts us to parametrize it using a second degree polynomial. This quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored by the data.</description>

      <title>Learning Balanced Field Summaries of the Large-Scale Structure with the Neural Field Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a cosmology analysis of weak lensing convergence maps using the Neural Field Scattering Transform (NFST) to constrain cosmological parameters. The NFST extends the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) by incorporating trainable neural field filters while preserving rotational and translational symmetries. This setup balances flexibility with robustness, ideal for learning in limited training data regimes. We apply the NFST to 500 simulations from the CosmoGrid suite, each providing a total of 1000 square degrees of noiseless weak lensing convergence maps. We use the resulting learned field compression to model the posterior over $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$ in a $w$CDM cosmology. The NFST consistently outperforms the WST benchmark, achieving a 16% increase in the average posterior probability density assigned to test data. Further, the NFST improves direct parameter prediction precision on $\sigma_8$ by 6% and w by 11%. We also introduce a new visualization technique to interpret the learned filters in physical space and show that the NFST adapts its feature extraction to capture task-specific information. These results establish the NFST as a promising tool for extracting maximal cosmological information from the non-Gaussian information in upcoming large-scale structure surveys, without requiring large simulated training datasets.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>QCD Equation of State with $N_f=3$ Flavors up to the Electroweak Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavors is determined non-perturbatively in the range of temperatures between $3$ and $165$~GeV with a precision of about $0.5$-$1.0$\%. The calculation is carried out by numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory discretized \`a la Wilson with shifted boundary conditions in the compact direction. At each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. Taken at face value, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann value by following a linear behavior in the strong coupling constant squared. They are also compatible with the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the coupling constant, a parametrization which describes well our data together with those present in the literature down to $500$ MeV.</description>
