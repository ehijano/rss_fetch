      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Renewable Energy Through Curtailment Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction (5-15%) of renewable energy generated goes into waste in the grids around the world today due to oversupply issues and transmission constraints. Being able to predict when and where renewable curtailment occurs would improve renewable utilization. The core of this work is to enable the machine learning community to help decarbonize electricity grids by unlocking the potential of renewable energy through curtailment prediction.</description>

      <title>A Verifiable Computing Scheme for Encrypted Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of cloud computing technologies has paved the way for deploying networked encrypted control systems, offering high performance, remote accessibility and privacy. However, in scenarios where the control algorithms run on third-party cloud service providers, the control logic might be changed by a malicious agent on the cloud. Consequently, it is imperative to verify the correctness of the control signals received from the cloud. Traditional verification methods, like zero-knowledge proof techniques, are computationally demanding in both proof generation and verification, may require several rounds of interactions between the prover and verifier and, consequently, are inapplicable in realtime control system applications. In this paper, we present a novel computationally inexpensive verifiable computing solution inspired by the probabilistic cut-and-choose approach. The proposed scheme allows the plant's actuator to validate the computations accomplished by the encrypted cloud-based networked controller without compromising the control scheme's performance. We showcase the effectiveness and real-time applicability of the proposed verifiable computation scheme using a remotely controlled Khepera IV differential-drive robot.</description>

      <title>Differentially-Private Distributed Model Predictive Control of Linear Discrete-Time Systems with Global Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) has attracted extensive attention as it can explicitly handle system constraints and achieve optimal control in a decentralized manner. However, the deployment of DMPC strategies generally requires the sharing of sensitive data among subsystems, which may violate the privacy of participating systems. In this paper, we propose a differentially-private DMPC algorithm for linear discrete-time systems subject to coupled global constraints. Specifically, we first show that a conventional distributed dual gradient algorithm can be used to address the considered DMPC problem but cannot provide strong privacy preservation. Then, to protect privacy against the eavesdropper, we incorporate a differential-privacy noise injection mechanism into the DMPC framework and prove that the resulting distributed optimization algorithm can ensure both provable convergence to a global optimal solution and rigorous $\epsilon$-differential privacy. In addition, an implementation strategy of the DMPC is designed such that the recursive feasibility and stability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. Numerical simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Signal-Comparison-Based Distributed Estimation Under Decaying Average Bit Rate Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates the distributed estimation problem under low bit rate communications. Based on the signal-comparison (SC) consensus protocol under binary-valued communications, a new consensus+innovations type distributed estimation algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the high-dimensional estimates are compressed into binary-valued messages by using a periodic compressive strategy, dithered noises and a sign function. Next, based on the dithered noises and expanding triggering thresholds, a new stochastic event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the communication frequency. Then, a modified SC consensus protocol is applied to fuse the neighborhood information. Finally, a stochastic approximation estimation algorithm is used to process innovations. The proposed SC-based algorithm has the advantages of high effectiveness and low communication cost. For the effectiveness, the estimates of the SC-based algorithm converge to the true value in the almost sure and mean square sense. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is also obtained. For the communication cost, the local and global average bit rates for communications decay to zero at a polynomial rate. The trade-off between the convergence rate and the communication cost is established through event-triggered coefficients. A better convergence rate can be achieved by decreasing event-triggered coefficients, while lower communication cost can be achieved by increasing event-triggered coefficients. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Most Influential Driver Nodes for Pinning Control of Multi-Agent Systems with Time-Varying Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the most influential driver nodes to guarantee the fastest synchronization speed is a key topic in pinning control of multi-agent systems. This paper develops a methodology to find the most influential pinning nodes under time-varying topologies. First, we provide the pinning control synchronization conditions of multi-agent systems. Second, a method is proposed to identify the best driver nodes that can guarantee the fastest synchronization speed under periodically switched systems. We show that the determination of the best driver nodes is independent of the system matrix under certain conditions. Finally, we develop a method to estimate the switching frequency threshold that can make the selected best driver nodes remain the same as the average system. Numerical simulations reveal the feasibility of these methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new under-actuated Bi-Quadcopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is introduced. The proposed drone configuration can be controlled similar to a Bicopter. The dynamics of the proposed Bi-Quadcopter is developed using the Newton-Euler approach. Using the force decomposition technique, a mapping between the control wrench and actuator inputs is developed. A nonlinear position control is applied for the Bi-Quadcopter using the quaternion-based cascaded attitude controller. The performance of the proposed UAV with the control algorithm is verified through simulations. Finally, the actuator failure scenarios were analyzed.</description>

      <title>A new platooning model for connected and autonomous vehicles to improve string stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel idea of coordinated vehicle platooning such that platoon followers inside the platoon communicates only to the platoon leader. A novel dynamic model is proposed to take driving safety into account when there is communication delay. Some general results of linear stability are proved mathematically, and numerical simulations are conducted to show the effect of model parameters for both ring road with an initial disturbance and infinite road with a periodic disturbance. The simulation results are consistent with theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed look-to-the-leader platooning strategy is far superior than the follow-one-vehicle-ahead or follow-two-vehicle-ahead conventional car-following (CF) strategies in stabilizing traffic flow. This paper provides a new perspective for the organization of platoons of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Proactive Load-Shaping Strategies with Privacy-Cost Trade-offs in Residential Households based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart meters play a crucial role in enhancing energy management and efficiency, but they raise significant privacy concerns by potentially revealing detailed user behaviors through energy consumption patterns. Recent scholarly efforts have focused on developing battery-aided load-shaping techniques to protect user privacy while balancing costs. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning-based load-shaping algorithm (PLS-DQN) designed to protect user privacy by proactively creating artificial load signatures that mislead potential attackers. We evaluate our proposed algorithm against a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) adversary. The results demonstrate that our approach not only effectively conceals real energy usage patterns but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing user privacy while maintaining cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Global and local observability of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies observability for non-uniform hypergraphs with inputs and outputs. To capture higher-order interactions, we define a canonical non-homogeneous dynamical system with nonlinear outputs on hypergraphs. We then construct algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions based on polynomial ideals and varieties for global observability at an initial state of hypergraphs. An example is given to illustrate the proposed criteria for observability. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions for local observability are derived based on rank conditions of observability matrices, which provide a framework to study local observability for non-uniform hypergraphs. Finally, the similarity of observability for hypergraphs is proposed using similarity of tensors, which reveals the relation of observability between two hypergraphs and helps to check the observability intuitively.</description>

      <title>Comparing Lazy Constraint Selection Strategies in Train Routing with Moving Block Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Railroad transportation plays a vital role in the future of sustainable mobility. Besides building new infrastructure, capacity can be improved by modern train control systems, e.g., based on moving blocks. At the same time, there is only limited work on how to optimally route trains using the potential gained by these systems. Recently, an initial approach for train routing with moving block control has been proposed to address this demand. However, detailed evaluations on so-called lazy constraints are missing, and no publicly available implementation exists. In this work, we close this gap by providing an extended approach as well as a flexible open-source implementation that can use different solving strategies. Using that, we experimentally evaluate what choices should be made when implementing a lazy constraint approach. The corresponding implementation and benchmarks are publicly available as part of the Munich Train Control Toolkit (MTCT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>Best Ergodic Averages via Optimal Graph Filters in Reversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of finding the best ergodic or Birkhoff averages in the ergodic theorem to ensure rapid convergence to a desired value, using graph filters. Our approach begins by representing a function on the state space as a graph signal, where the (directed) graph is formed by the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain. We introduce a concept of graph variation, enabling the definition of the graph Fourier transform for graph signals on this directed graph. Viewing the iteration in the ergodic theorem as a graph filter, we recognize its non-optimality and propose three optimization problems aimed at determining optimal graph filters. These optimization problems yield the Bernstein, Chebyshev, and Legendre filters. Numerical testing reveals that while the Bernstein filter performs slightly better than the traditional ergodic average, the Chebyshev and Legendre filters significantly outperform the ergodic average, demonstrating rapid convergence to the desired value.</description>

      <title>Distributed Management of Fluctuating Energy Resources in Dynamic Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power systems integrate renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) as an environment-friendly enhancement to meet the ever-increasing demands. However, the inherent unreliability of renewable energy renders developing DER management algorithms imperative. We study the energy-sharing problem in a system consisting of several DERs. Each agent harvests and distributes renewable energy in its neighborhood to optimize the network's performance while minimizing energy waste. We model this problem as a bandit convex optimization problem with constraints that correspond to each node's limitations for energy production. We propose distributed decision-making policies to solve the formulated problem, where we utilize the notion of dynamic regret as the performance metric. We also include an adjustment strategy in our developed algorithm to reduce the constraint violations. Besides, we design a policy that deals with the non-stationary environment. Theoretical analysis shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments using a real-world dataset show superior performance of our proposal compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Convex neural network synthesis for robustness in the 1-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With neural networks being used to control safety-critical systems, they increasingly have to be both accurate (in the sense of matching inputs to outputs) and robust. However, these two properties are often at odds with each other and a trade-off has to be navigated. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to generate an approximation of a neural network which is certifiably more robust. Crucially, the method is fully convex and posed as a semi-definite programme. An application to robustifying model predictive control is used to demonstrate the results. The aim of this work is to introduce a method to navigate the neural network robustness/accuracy trade-off.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Short-term Load Forecasting of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) has rendered the load forecasting of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) increasingly critical. The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MSTEM in short-term continuous load forecasting for EVCS.</description>

      <title>HawkVision: Low-Latency Modeless Edge AI Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend of modeless ML inference is increasingly growing in popularity as it hides the complexity of model inference from users and caters to diverse user and application accuracy requirements. Previous work mostly focuses on modeless inference in data centers. To provide low-latency inference, in this paper, we promote modeless inference at the edge. The edge environment introduces additional challenges related to low power consumption, limited device memory, and volatile network environments.
  To address these challenges, we propose HawkVision, which provides low-latency modeless serving of vision DNNs. HawkVision leverages a two-layer edge-DC architecture that employs confidence scaling to reduce the number of model options while meeting diverse accuracy requirements. It also supports lossy inference under volatile network environments. Our experimental results show that HawkVision outperforms current serving systems by up to 1.6X in P99 latency for providing modeless service. Our FPGA prototype demonstrates similar performance at certain accuracy levels with up to a 3.34X reduction in power consumption.</description>

      <title>Discovering deposition process regimes: leveraging unsupervised learning for process insights, surrogate modeling, and sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a comprehensive approach utilizing data-driven methods to elucidate the deposition process regimes in Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactors and the interplay of physical mechanism that dominate in each one of them. Through this work, we address three key objectives. Firstly, our methodology relies on process outcomes, derived by a detailed CFD model, to identify clusters of "outcomes" corresponding to distinct process regimes, wherein the relative influence of input variables undergoes notable shifts. This phenomenon is experimentally validated through Arrhenius plot analysis, affirming the efficacy of our approach. Secondly, we demonstrate the development of an efficient surrogate model, based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), that maintains accuracy, facilitating streamlined computational analyses. Finally, as a result of PCE, sensitivity analysis is made possible by means of Sobol' indices, that quantify the impact of process inputs across identified regimes. The insights gained from our analysis contribute to the formulation of hypotheses regarding phenomena occurring beyond the transition regime. Notably, the significance of temperature even in the diffusion-limited regime, as evidenced by the Arrhenius plot, suggests activation of gas phase reactions at elevated temperatures. Importantly, our proposed methods yield insights that align with experimental observations and theoretical principles, aiding decision-making in process design and optimization. By circumventing the need for costly and time-consuming experiments, our approach offers a pragmatic pathway towards enhanced process efficiency. Moreover, this study underscores the potential of data-driven computational methods for innovating reactor design paradigms.</description>

Abstract: Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</description>

      <title>"Golden Ratio Yoshimura" for Meta-Stable and Massively Reconfigurable Deployment</title>

Abstract: Yoshimura origami is a classical folding pattern that has inspired many deployable structure designs. Its applications span from space exploration, kinetic architectures, and soft robots to even everyday household items. However, despite its wide usage, Yoshimura has been fixated on a set of design constraints to ensure its flat-foldability. Through extensive kinematic analysis and prototype tests, this study presents a new Yoshimura that intentionally defies these constraints. Remarkably, one can impart a unique meta-stability by using the Golden Ratio angle to define the triangular facets of a generalized Yoshimura. As a result, when its facets are strategically popped out, a ``Golden Ratio Yoshimura'' boom with $m$ modules can be theoretically reconfigured into $8^m$ geometrically unique and load-bearing shapes. This result not only challenges the existing design norms but also opens up a new avenue to create deployable and versatile structural systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing can enable robots to perform complex, contact-rich tasks. Magnetic sensors offer accurate three-axis force measurements while using affordable materials. Calibrating such a sensor involves either manual data collection, or automated procedures with precise mounting of the sensor relative to an actuator. We present an open-source magnetic tactile sensor with an automatic, in situ, gripper-agnostic calibration method, after which the sensor is immediately ready for use. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry for tactile sensing, fostering collaboration in robotics.

      <description>arXiv:2405.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative driving, enabled by communication between automated vehicle systems, promises significant benefits to fuel efficiency, road capacity, and safety over single-vehicle driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC). However, the responsible development and implementation of these algorithms poses substantial challenges due to the need for extensive real-world testing. We address this issue and introduce OpenConvoy, an open and extensible framework designed for the implementation and assessment of cooperative driving policies on physical connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). We demonstrate the capabilities of OpenConvoy through a series of experiments on a convoy of multi-scale vehicles controlled by Platooning to show the stability of our system across vehicle configurations and its ability to effectively measure convoy cohesion across driving scenarios including varying degrees of communication loss.</description>

      <title>Resilient Average Consensus with Adversaries via Distributed Detection and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of resilient average consensus in multi-agent systems where some of the agents are subject to failures or attacks. The objective of resilient average consensus is for non-faulty/normal agents to converge to the average of their initial values despite the erroneous effects from malicious agents. To this end, we propose a successful distributed iterative resilient average consensus algorithm for the multi-agent networks with general directed topologies. The proposed algorithm has two parts at each iteration: detection and averaging. For the detection part, we propose two distributed algorithms and one of them can detect malicious agents with only the information from direct in-neighbors. For the averaging part, we extend the applicability of an existing averaging algorithm where normal agents can remove the effects from malicious agents so far, after they are detected. Another important feature of our method is that it can handle the case where malicious agents are neighboring and collaborating with each other to mislead the normal ones from averaging. This case cannot be solved by existing detection approaches in related literature. Moreover, our algorithm is efficient in storage usage especially for large-scale networks as each agent only requires the values of neighbors within two hops. Lastly, numerical examples are given to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of ResNets and neural ODEs can be formulated and analyzed from the perspective of optimal control. This paper proposes a dissipative formulation of the training of ResNets and neural ODEs for classification problems by including a variant of the cross-entropy as a regularization in the stage cost. Based on the dissipative formulation of the training, we prove that the trained ResNet exhibit the turnpike phenomenon. We then illustrate that the training exhibits the turnpike phenomenon by training on the two spirals and MNIST datasets. This can be used to find very shallow networks suitable for a given classification task.</description>

      <title>Aggregator of Electric Vehicles Bidding in Nordic FCR-D Markets: A Chance-Constrained Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, has recently released innovative grid codes allowing stochastic flexible resources to bid their flexibility in Nordic ancillary service markets, provided that the probability of the reserve capacity bid to be successfully realized is at least 90%. For resources like batteries with a limited energy reservoir, Energinet imposes additional requirements when bidding into Nordic ancillary service markets. Taken into account all these requirements, this paper develops a chance-constrained optimization model for an aggregator of electric vehicles to optimally place a reserve capacity bid in the Nordic Frequency Containment Reserve for Disturbances (FCR-D) market while accounting for uncertainty in its future consumption baseline. We consider both FCR-D up and down markets, reformulate and solve the proposed joint chance-constrained model using two distinct sample-based methods, namely ALSO-X and conditional value-at-risk. Using real data from 1400 charging boxes in Denmark in the time period of March 2022 to March 2023, we present the out-of-sample profit, showing the vehicle owners could have a saving of 6-10% in their annual electricity bill by providing FCR-D services. We have also observed a synergy effect, implying more vehicles in a single portfolio enables placing a larger bid per vehicle, compared to a collective bid of multiple portfolios with the same number of vehicles in total.</description>

      <title>Towards a Low-SWaP 1024-beam Digital Array: A 32-beam Sub-system at 5.8 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave communications require multibeam beamforming in order to utilize wireless channels that suffer from obstructions, path loss, and multi-path effects. Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of freedom compared to analog phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power consumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple simultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\: \log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a 46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively, for the $N=32$ case considered. The paper describes the proposed 32-point DFT approximation targeting a 1024-beams using a 2D array, and shows the multiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam sub-system consisting of 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without multiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx FPGA at 120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with measured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT as well as the proposed multiplier-free algorithm and are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Coupling OMNeT++ and mosaik for integrated Co-Simulation of ICT-reliant Smart Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy resources requires so-called smart grid services for monitoring, control and automation tasks. Simulation environments are vital for evaluating and developing innovative solutions and algorithms. Especially in smart energy systems, we face a variety of heterogeneous simulators representing, e.g., power grids, analysis or control components and markets. The co-simulation framework mosaik can be used to orchestrate the data exchange and time synchronization between individual simulators. So far, the underlying communication infrastructure has often been assumed to be optimal and therefore, the influence of e.g., communication delays has been neglected. This paper presents the first results of the project cosima, which aims at connecting the communication simulator OMNeT++ to the co-simulation framework mosaik to analyze the resilience and robustness of smart grid services, e.g., multi-agent-based services with respect to adaptivity, scalability, extensibility and usability. This facilitates simulations with realistic communication technologies (such as 5G) and the analysis of dynamic communication characteristics by simulating multiple messages. We show the functionality and benefits of cosima in experiments with 50 agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11789v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework of distributed random inverse problems over network graphs with online measurements, and propose a decentralized online learning algorithm. This unifies the distributed parameter estimation in Hilbert spaces and the least mean square problem in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS-LMS). We transform the convergence of the algorithm into the asymptotic stability of a class of inhomogeneous random difference equations in Hilbert spaces with L2-bounded martingale difference terms and develop the L2 -asymptotic stability theory in Hilbert spaces. It is shown that if the network graph is connected and the sequence of forward operators satisfies the infinite-dimensional spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition, then the estimates of all nodes are mean square and almost surely strongly consistent. Moreover, we propose a decentralized online learning algorithm in RKHS based on non-stationary and non-independent online data streams, and prove that the algorithm is mean square and almost surely strongly consistent if the operators induced by the random input data satisfy the infinite-dimensional spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition.</description>

      <title>Goal-Reaching Trajectory Design Near Danger with Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots must maintain safety, but should not sacrifice performance, leading to the classical reach-avoid problem: find a trajectory that is guaranteed to reach a goal and avoid obstacles. This paper addresses the near danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off the common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models and ensure safety, but doing so introduces numerical approximation error conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach avoid methods in near-danger goal reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we study the mean square asymptotic stability of a class of random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences dependent on the homogeneous ones. Secondly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path, and show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying in some sense, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the regularization path in mean square. Furthermore, if the data streams also satisfy the RKHS persistence of excitation condition, i.e. there exists a fixed length of time period, such that each eigenvalue of the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every time period has a uniformly positive lower bound with respect to time, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the unknown function in mean square. Finally, for the case with independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency provided the marginal probability measures induced by the input data are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wheeled Passive Sliding with Fully-Actuated Aerial Robots: Tip-Over Recovery and Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Push-and-slide tasks carried out by fully-actuated aerial robots can be used for inspection and simple maintenance tasks at height, such as non-destructive testing and painting. Often, an end-effector based on multiple non-actuated contact wheels is used to contact the surface. This approach entails challenges in ensuring consistent wheel contact with a surface whose exact orientation and location might be uncertain due to sensor aliasing and drift. Using a standard full-pose controller dependent on the inaccurate surface position and orientation may cause wheels to lose contact during sliding, and subsequently lead to robot tip-over. To address the tip-over issue, we present two approaches: (1) tip-over avoidance guidelines for hardware design, and (2) control for tip-over recovery and avoidance. Physical experiments with a fully-actuated aerial vehicle were executed for a push-and-slide task on a flat surface. The resulting data is used in deriving tip-over avoidance guidelines and designing a simulator that closely captures real-world conditions. We then use the simulator to test the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches in risky scenarios against uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Simulation experiments on six problems under five agents, including the benchmarked one, provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</description>
