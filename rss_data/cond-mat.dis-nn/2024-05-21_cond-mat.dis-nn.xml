      <title>Zagreb Connection indices on polyomino chains and random polyomino chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we delve into the exploration of the first and second Zagreb connection indices of both polyomino chains and random polyomino chains. Our methodology relies on the utilization of Markov chain theory. Within this framework, the article thoroughly examines precise formulas and investigates extreme values. Leveraging the derived formulas, we further explore and elucidate the long-term behavior exhibited by random polyomino chains.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Approach for Medical Imaging: Applications to Background Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background noise in medical imaging poses significant challenges for accurate diagnosis, prompting the development of denoising algorithms. Traditional methodologies, however, often struggle to address the complexities of noisy environments in high dimensional imaging systems. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for denoising medical images, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process, resulting in compression of imaging modes by over 70 percent. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed method is a standalone algorithm with minimal manual intervention, demonstrating its potential to achieve quantum-level performance without heavy reliance on classical algorithms. Through experimental validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise- related challenges in medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for current and future quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of quantum channels on NISQ devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World-wide efforts aim at the realization of advanced quantum simulators and processors. However, despite the development of intricate hardware and pulse control systems, it may still not be generally known which effective quantum dynamics, or channels, are implemented on these devices. To systematically infer those, we propose a neural-network algorithm approximating generic discrete-time dynamics through the repeated action of an effective quantum channel. We test our approach considering time-periodic Lindblad dynamics as well as non-unitary subsystem dynamics in many-body unitary circuits. Moreover, we exploit it to investigate cross-talk effects on the ibmq_ehningen quantum processor, which showcases our method as a practically applicable tool for inferring quantum channels when the exact nature of the underlying dynamics on the physical device is not known a priori. While the present approach is tailored for learning Markovian dynamics, we discuss how it can be adapted to also capture generic non-Markovian discrete-time evolutions.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamic hyperuniform states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>

      <title>Principal component analysis of absorbing state phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of two one-dimensional lattice models belonging to distinct nonequilibrium universality classes - directed bond percolation and branching and annihilating random walks with even number of offspring. We find that the uncentered PCA of datasets storing various system's configurations can be successfully used to determine the critical properties of these nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, in both cases, we obtain good estimates of the critical point and the dynamical critical exponent of the models. For directed bond percolation we are, furthermore, able to extract critical exponents associated with the correlation length and the order parameter. We discuss the relation of our analysis with low-rank approximations of datasets.</description>

      <title>Topological zero-modes of the spectral localizer of trivial metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators are described by topological invariants that can be computed by integrals over momentum space, but also as traces over local, real-space topological markers. These markers are useful to detect topological insulating phases in disordered crystals, quasicrystals and amorphous systems. Among these markers, only the spectral localizer operator can be used to distinguish topological metals, that show zero-modes of the localizer spectrum. However, it remains unclear whether trivial metals also display zero-modes, and if their localizer spectrum is distinguishable from topological ones. Here, we show that trivial metals generically display zero-modes of the localizer spectrum. The localizer zero-modes are determined by the zero-mode solutions of a Dirac equation with a varying mass parameter. We use this observation, valid in any dimension, to determine the difference between the localizer spectrum of trivial and topological metals, and conjecture the spectrum of the localizer for fractional quantum Hall edges. Because the localizer is a local, real-space operator, it may be used as a tool to differentiate between non-crystalline topological and trivial metals, and characterize strongly correlated systems, for which local topological markers are scarce.</description>

      <title>On the structure factor of jammed particle configurations on the one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broad class of blocked or jammed configurations of particles on the one-dimensional lattice can be characterized in terms of local rules involving only the lengths of clusters of particles (occupied sites) and of holes (empty sites). Examples of physical relevance include the metastable states reached by kinetically constrained spin chains, the attractors of totally irreversible processes such as random sequential adsorption, and arrays of Rydberg atoms in the blockade regime. The configurational entropy of ensembles of such blocked configurations has been investigated recently by means of an approach inspired from the theory of stochastic renewal processes. This approach provides a valuable alternative to the more traditional transfer-matrix formalism. We show that the renewal approach is also an efficient tool to investigate a range of observables in uniform ensembles of blocked configurations, besides their configurational entropy. The main emphasis is on their structure factor and correlation function.</description>

      <title>Effects of coordination and stiffness scale-separation in disordered elastic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many fibrous materials are modeled as elastic networks featuring a substantial separation between the stiffness scales that characterize different microscopic deformation modes of the network's constituents. This scale separation has been shown to give rise to emergent complexity in these systems' linear and nonlinear mechanical response. Here we study numerically a simple model featuring said stiffness scale-separation in two-dimensions and show that its mechanical response is governed by the competition between the characteristic stiffness of collective nonphononic soft modes of the stiff subsystem, and the characteristic stiffness of the soft interactions. We present and rationalize the behavior of the shear modulus of our complex networks across the unjamming transition at which the stiff subsystem alone loses its macroscopic mechanical rigidity. We further establish a relation in the soft-interaction-dominated regime between the shear modulus, the characteristic frequency of nonphononic vibrational modes, and the mesoscopic correlation length that marks the crossover from a disorder-dominated response to local mechanical perturbations in the near-field, to a linear, continuum-like response in the far field. The effects of spatial dimension on the observed scaling behavior are discussed, in addition to the interplay between stiffness scales in strain-stiffened networks, which is relevant to understanding the nonlinear mechanics of non-Brownian fibrous biomatter.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This provides a solution to a longstanding mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>
