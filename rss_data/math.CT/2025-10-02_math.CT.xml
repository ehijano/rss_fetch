      <title>Cohomology of Small Cartesian Closed Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the isomorphism between the Quillen cohomology and the Baues-Wirsching cohomology of a cartesian closed category (CCC). This is an extension of the results of Dwyer-Kan for small categories and Jibladze-Pirashvili for small categories with finite products. These results implies that The Quillen cohomology of a CCC C coincides with that of C as a category with finite products, and also that of C as a small category</description>

      <title>Stable first order theories as simplicial profinite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rewrite simplicially the standard definitions of a complete first order theory, a model of it, and various characterisations of stability of a complete first order theory. In our reformulations the simplicial language replaces the standard definitions based on syntax, making them formally unnecessary.
  We view a complete first-order theory as a symmetric simplicial object in the category of profinite sets and open continuous maps, defined by the functor sending a finite set of variables into the Stone space of complete types in those variables. A model of a complete first-order theory is then a morphism from a representable simplicial set satisfying certain lifting properties reminiscent of, but weaker then, those in the definition of a fibration. The class of simplicial profinite sets corresponding to complete first order theories is characterised by the same lifting properties required of the map from the simplicial covering space (decalage) forgetting the extra degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Notions of Cauchy completeness for normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As already mentioned by Lawvere in his 1973 paper, the characterisation of Cauchy completeness of metric spaces in terms of representability of adjoint distributors amounts to the idempotent-split property of an ordinary category when the governing symmetric monoidal-closed category is changed from the extended real half-line to the category of sets. In this paper, for any commutative quantale \(\mathcal{V}\), we extend these two characterisations of Lawvere-style completeness to \(\mathcal{V}\)-normed categories, thus replacing \([0,\infty]\) and \(\mathsf{Set}\) more generally by the category \(\mathsf{Set}{/\!\!/}\mathcal{V}\) of \(\mathcal{V}\)-normed sets. We also establish improvements of recent results regarding the normed convergence of Cauchy sequences in two important \(\mathcal{V}\)-normed categories.</description>

      <title>Category Theory for Supercomputing: The Tensor Product of Linear BSP Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a particular class of parallel algorithm for linear functions can be straightforwardly generalized to a parallel algorithm of their tensor product. The central idea is to take a model of parallel algorithms -- Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) -- that decomposes parallel algorithms into so-called supersteps that are one of two types: a computation superstep that only does local computations, or a communication superstep that only communicates between processors. We connect each type of supersteps to linear algebra with functors. Each superstep in isolation is simple enough to compute their tensor product in Vect with well-known techniques of linear algebra. We then individually translate the tensor product of supersteps back to the language of BSP algorithms. The functoriality of the tensor product allows us to compose the supersteps back into a BSP algorithm for the tensor product of the original function. We state the recipe for creating these new algorithms with only a minimal amount of algebra, so that it can be applied without understanding the category-theoretic details. We have previously used this to derive an efficient algorithm for the higher-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform, which we use as an example throughout this paper. We also derive a parallel algorithm for the Discrete Cosine Transform to demonstrate the generality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Accepting Normalization via Markov Magmoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalization of probability distributions is not a distributive law. We introduce distributive sesquilaws to abstract normalization and, from their axioms, we derive some of its properties. In particular, normalized channels form a unital magmoid with an action of the category of subdistributions; its possibilistic analogue is the action from may-must relations into the category of relations. We argue that the magmoid of normalized channels is the stochastic analog of the category of relations.</description>

      <title>Silting reduction, relative AGK's construction and Higgs construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Calabi--Yau quadruple as a generalization of Iyama--Yang's Calabi--Yau triple. For each \((d+1)\)-Calabi--Yau quadruple, we show that the associated Higgs category is a \(d\)-Calabi--Yau Frobenius extriangulated category, which moreover admits a canonical \(d\)-cluster-tilting subcategory. Concrete examples arise from the construction of relative cluster categories and Higgs categories in the setting of ice quivers with potentials, as well as from the singularity category of an isolated singularity. As an application, we prove that both the relative Amiot--Guo--Keller's construction and the Higgs construction of a \((d+1)\)-Calabi--Yau quadruple take silting reduction to Calabi--Yau reduction.</description>

      <title>Joins of closed sublocales are not always a coframe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a locale $L$, the collection $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ of joins of closed sublocales forms a frame--somewhat unexpectedly, as it is naturally embedded in the coframe of all sublocales of $L$, where by coframe we mean the order-theoretic dual of a frame. This construction has attracted attention in point-free topology: as a maximal essential extension in the category of frames, for its (non-)functorial properties, its relation to canonical extensions and exact filters of frames, etc.
  A central open question of the theory, posed by Picado, Pultr, and Tozzi in 2019, asked whether $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ is always a coframe, or whether there exists a locale for which this fails. In this paper, we resolve this question in the negative by constructing a locale $L$ such that $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ is not a coframe. The main challenge in such questions lies in the difficulty of understanding exact infima in $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$; we circumvent this by analysing a certain separation property satisfied by $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$.</description>

      <title>Comparing dg category models for path spaces via $A_\infty$-functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a many-object dual version of Chen's iterated integral map. For any topological space X, the construction takes the form of an A-infinity functor between two dg categories whose objects are the points of X: the domain has as morphisms the singular (cubical) chains on the space of (Moore) paths in X and the codomain has morphisms arising by totalizing a cosimplicial chain complex determined by the dg coalgebra of singular (simplicial) chains in X. When X is simply connected, we show this construction defines a homotopy inverse to a classical map of Adams, which sends ordered sequences of singular simplices in X linked by shared vertices to cubes of paths in X. When X is not necessarily simply connected, following an idea of Irie, we incorporate the fundamental groupoid of X into the construction and deduce analogous results. Along the way, we provide an elementary and new proof of the fact that the (direct-sum) cobar construction of the chains in X, suitably interpreted, models the dg category of paths in X, an extension of Adams's cobar theorem established by Rivera-Zeinalian using different methods.</description>

      <title>Stratifying systems and Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07808v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stratifying systems, which have been defined for module, triangulated and exact categories previously, were developed to produce examples of standardly stratified algebras. A stratifying system $\Phi$ is a finite set of objects satisfying some orthogonality conditions. One very interesting property is that the subcategory $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ of objects admitting a composition series-like filtration with factors in $\Phi$ has the Jordan-H\"{o}lder property on these filtrations.
  This article has two main aims. First, we introduce notions of subobjects, simple objects and composition series for an extriangulated category, in order to define a Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category. Moreover, we characterise Jordan-H\"{o}lder, length, weakly idempotent complete extriangulated categories in terms of the associated Grothendieck monoid and Grothendieck group. Second, we develop a theory of stratifying systems in extriangulated categories. We define projective stratifying systems and show that every stratifying system $\Phi$ in an extriangulated category is part of a minimal projective one $(\Phi,Q)$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ is a length, Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category when $(\Phi,Q)$ satisfies a left exactness condition.
  We give several examples and answer a recent question of Enomoto--Saito in the negative.</description>

      <title>The Gauss-Markov Adjunction Provides Categorical Semantics of Residuals in Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle, and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most basic form of supervised learning. By defining two Lawvere-enriched categories corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning. We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.</description>
