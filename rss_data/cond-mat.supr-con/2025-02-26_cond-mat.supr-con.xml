      <title>Anomalous energy gap in superconducting La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate thin films under ambient pressure provides an opportunity to directly investigate characteristic energy scales of the superconducting state from electronic structure. Here, we successfully probe the energy gap and dispersion renormalization in one unit-cell La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates, by developing an ultra-high vacuum quenching technique for in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The energy gap is observed on the underlying Fermi surface without showing a node along the Brillouin zone diagonal. This gap exhibits particle-hole symmetric behavior and persists to a temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the existence of a pseudogap. An abrupt band renormalization is observed with a dispersion anomaly at ~70 meV below Fermi level, pointing to another energy scale besides the energy gap. These observations provide initial information on fundamental properties of the superconducting state in bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Probing Mixed Valence States by Nuclear Spin-Spin Relaxation Time Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several elements in the periodic table exhibit an interesting and often overlooked feature: They skip certain valence states which is discussed in the field of superconductivity to be in favor of fostering higher transition temperatures $T_c$. However, from the experimental point of view, it is often deemed difficult to probe changes in the valence state. Here we demonstrate that the latter are accessible by the spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ in nuclear magnetic resonance. As target material, we chose the solid solution Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te, where valence-skipping In induces superconductivity and changes its valence state as a function of $x$. We observe a strong enhancement in $1/T_2(x)$ and, most importantly, find that $1/T_2$ and $T_c$ exhibit a strikingly similar $x$ dependence. These results underline the importance of valence physics for the evolution of superconductivity in Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te. A model based on a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type of interaction among the In nuclei is proposed which fully accounts for the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced $SrTiO_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their $T_c$ has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for $T_c$ enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting $SrTiO_3$ substrates. $T_c$ onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where $T_c$ of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. The specific phase responsible for these notable effects was not yet identified, and further research is needed in order to identify and isolate the relevant phase.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the spin-orbit scattering in small-sized superconducting particles in the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Knight shift of nuclear magnetic resonance is an experimental probe of the paramagnetic spin susceptibility in metals. Information about the electron pairing in superconductors can be extracted from the Knight shift in the small-sized particles. The finite zero-temperature magnitude of paramagnetic susceptibility observed in the superconducting particles has been associated with the spin-orbit scattering of conduction electrons. The conventional treatment has delivered the paramagnetic susceptibility magnitude proportional to the square of the spin-orbit interaction amplitude. Here we examine the coupling between the superconducting current and the spin-orbit scattering of conduction electrons in the small-sized particles. Such interference coupling, absent in the normal state, results in an additional spin polarization of the conduction electrons generating the superconducting current in the magnetic field. This anomalous effect delivers the noticeably larger contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility. The magnitude of the effect as well as the contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility prove to be proportional to the amplitude of spin-orbit interaction. The frequency of electron paramagnetic resonance is shifted as well.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structures across the Superconductor-Insulator Transition at La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial superconductivity discovered in bilayer nickelate heterostructures opens new avenues for effective tunability and control. Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level. Our findings establish an element- and orbital-resolved electronic framework for the origin of superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states are analyzed within mean-field theory, where orbital FF state is layer-polarized with inversion symmetry broken, while orbital LO state is Josephson vortex array with translation symmetry reduced. Phase diagrams of orbital FFLO states are obtained, and properties such as induced orders, superconducting diode effects, Fraunhofer pattern and topological defects are studied for the probe of FF versus LO states.</description>

      <title>The Maximum $T_c$ of Conventional Superconductors at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical maximum critical temperature ($T_c$) for conventional superconductors at ambient pressure remains a fundamental question in condensed matter physics. Through analysis of electron-phonon calculations for over 20,000 metals, we critically examine this question. We find that while hydride metals can exhibit maximum phonon frequencies of more than 5000 K, the crucial logarithmic average frequency $\omega_\text{log}$ rarely exceeds 1800 K. Our data reveals an inherent trade-off between $\omega_\text{log}$ and the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$, suggesting that the optimal Eliashberg function that maximizes $T_c$ is unphysical. Based on our calculations, we identify Li$_2$AgH$_6$ and its sibling Li$_2$AuH$_6$ as theoretical materials that likely approach the practical limit for conventional superconductivity at ambient pressure. Analysis of thermodynamic stability indicates that compounds with higher predicted $T_c$ values are increasingly unstable, making their synthesis challenging. While fundamental physical laws do not strictly limit $T_c$ to low-temperatures, our analysis suggests that achieving room-temperature conventional superconductivity at ambient pressure is extremely unlikely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently discovered multiple superconducting states in rhombohedral graphene quarter metal. We demonstrate that one of these states features a single-spin, single-valley, single-band, single-Fermi-pocket parent state and is most likely a chiral topological pair-density wave, marked by a threefold symmetry that may not be spontaneously broken, unpaired Majorana zero modes at edges, vortices, and dislocations, and an anomalous intrinsic superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Atomic layer etching of niobium nitride using sequential exposures of O$_2$ and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium nitride (NbN) is a metallic superconductor that is widely used for superconducting electronics due to its high transition temperature ($T_c$) and kinetic inductance. Processing-induced damage negatively affects the performance of these devices by mechanisms such as microwave surface loss. Atomic layer etching (ALE), with its ability to etch with Angstrom-scale control and low damage, has the potential to address these issues, but no ALE process is known for NbN. Here, we report such a process consisting of sequential exposures of O$_2$ plasma and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. Exposure to O$_2$ plasma rather than O$_2$ gas yields a greater fraction of Nb in the +5 oxidation state, which is then volatilized by NbF$_5$ formation with exposure to an H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. The SF$_6$:H$_2$ flow rate ratio is chosen to produce selective etching of Nb$_2$O$_5$ over NbN, enabling self-limiting etching within a cycle. An etch rate of 1.77 \r{A}/cycle was measured at 125 $^\circ$C using ex-situ ellipsometry. The $T_c$ of the ALE-etched film is higher than that of an RIE-etched film of a similar thickness, highlighting the low-damage nature of the process. These findings have relevance for applications of NbN in single-photon detectors and superconducting microresonators.</description>

      <title>Microwave dynamics of gated Al/InAs superconducting nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several experiments have recently reported on gate-tunable superconducting properties in metallic devices, holding promise for the realization of cryogenic switches, tunable resonators, and superconducting logic. In particular, the suppression of the critical current as a function of the gate voltage has been widely investigated. However, time-domain studies are discussed only in a few cases. In this paper, we present a microwave characterization of a gate-controlled Al-capped InAs nanowire embedded in a $\lambda/4$ coplanar waveguide resonator. We observe a shift in the resonator frequency and an increase in its internal losses as a function of the gate voltage, which we relate to a change in the imaginary and real components of the nanowire impedance, respectively. We demonstrate that these changes are described by the Mattis-Bardeen model with an effective temperature. We further study the resonator response to fast gate signals and measure characteristic response times of the order of 40 ns, both in time-domain and parametric modulation experiments. Our study elucidates the impact of the gate on the complex impedance of the nanowire in the superconducting state, as well as its dynamic performance, providing a foundation for the design of gate-controlled superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Modelling of a large-scale non-insulated non-planar HTS stellarator coil using Quanscient Allsolve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellarators present features such as steady-state operation and intrinsic stability that make them more attractive than tokamaks in their scaling to fusion power plants. By leveraging more possible configurations, stellarators can be optimized for better engineering feasibility, e.g., resilience to manufacturing tolerances, reduced mechanical load on conductor, material optimization, cost of fabrication. Finite Element Analyses are crucial for the design and optimization of High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) REBCO non-planar coils. However, accurate simulation of large-scale magnetostatic, mechanical, and quench models can take days or even weeks to compute. In this work, we present a model of a real-size, HTS, non-insulated, non-planar stellarator coil and perform in Quanscient Allsolve, a transient simulation study including modelling quench, using the $H-\varphi$ formulation. It is shown that transient model benefits heavily from the built-in Domain Decomposition Method (DDM), which allows reaching reasonable computation times. Such models become then invaluable in predicting and understanding the complex behavior of non-insulated large-scale REBCO magnets, including their intrinsic energy imbalance.</description>

Abstract: The applications of superconducting cable or magnet require that the superconductors are made into wires or tapes. For cuprate superconductors, this is a big challenge because of the strong flux motion induced by high anisotropy, very short coherence length and strong thermal fluctuation, etc. One of the ways is to fabricate superconducting films on flexible metallic tapes with oxide buffer layers. The successful one so far is the REBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (REBCO, RE=rare earth elements) films in tape form, as called the coated conductors. While the superconducting transition temperature of REBCO system is limited to about 90 K. Here we report the successful fabrication of another new non-toxic superconducting film, namely (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9\pm\delta}$ on these flexible metallic tapes with LaMnO$_3$ and CeO$_2$ as the top layers. The onset superconducting transition occurs at 112 K and 110 K, and the zero-resistance transition temperatures are about 96 K and 98 K, respectively. The temperature dependent resistivity under magnetic fields in different directions reveal a relatively small anisotropy. Further optimization of the films will improve the zero resistance transition temperature, thus can also improve the characteristic properties for applications. Our results show that the (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9\pm\delta}$ is a promising candidate material for the high power applications in liquid nitrogen temperature region.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface reconstruction and enhanced spin fluctuations in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ on LaAlO$_3$(001) and SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the structural and electronic properties of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 on LaAlO3(001) and SrTiO3(001) by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology akin to superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure, yet with spin fluctuations enhanced considerably beyond pressure effects. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure versus epitaxial strain and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, particularly under tensile strain, as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.</description>

Abstract: Circuit QED based quantum information processing relies on low noise amplification for signal readout. In the realm of microwave superconducting circuits, this amplification is often achieved via Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA). In the past, these amplifiers exhibited low power added efficiency (PAE), which is roughly the fraction of pump power that is converted to output signal power. This is increasingly relevant because recent attempts to build high saturation power amplifiers achieve this at the cost of very low PAE, which in turn puts a high heat load on the cryostat and limits the number of these devices that a dilution refrigerator can host. Here, we numerically investigate upper bounds on PAE. We focus on a class of parametric amplifiers that consists of a capacitor shunted by a nonlinear inductive block. We first set a benchmark for this class of amplifiers by considering nonlinear blocks described by an arbitrary polynomial current-phase relation. Next, we propose two circuit implementations of the nonlinear block. Finally, we investigate chaining polynomial amplifiers. We find that while amplifiers with higher gain have a lower PAE, regardless of the gain there is considerable room to improve as compared to state of the art devices. For example, for a phase-sensitive amplifier with a power gain of 20 dB, the PAE is ~0.1% for typical JPAs, 5.9% for our simpler circuit JPAs, 34% for our more complex circuit JPAs, 48% for our arbitrary polynomial amplifiers, and at least 95% for our chained amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of Static and Dynamic Charge Correlations revealed by Uniaxial Strain in a Cuprate Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use uniaxial strain in combination with ultra-high-resolution Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K- and copper L3-edges to study the excitations stemming from the charge ordering wave vector in La1.875Sr0.125CuO4. By detwinning stripe ordering, we demonstrate that the optical phonon anomalies do not show any stripe anisotropy. The low-energy charge excitations also retain an in-plane four-fold symmetry. As such, we find that both phonon and charge excitations are decoupled entirely from the strength of static charge ordering. The almost isotropic character of charge excitations is indicative of a quantum critical behaviour and remains a possible source for the strange metal properties found in the normal state of cuprate superconductors.</description>
