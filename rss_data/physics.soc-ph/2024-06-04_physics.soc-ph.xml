      <title>Graph structural complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced the quantitative measure of the structural complexity of the graph (complex network, etc.) based on a procedure similar to the renormalization process, considering the difference between actual and averaged graph structures on different scales. The proposed concept of the graph structural complexity corresponds to qualitative comprehension of the complexity. The proposed measure can be obtained for the weighted graphs also. The structural complexities for various graph types were found - the deterministic infinite and finite size graphs, artificial graphs of different natures including percolation structures, and the time series of cardiac rhythms mapped to complex networks using the parametric visibility graph algorithm. The latter reaches a maximum near the formation of a giant component in the graph or at the percolation threshold for 2D and 3D square lattices when a giant cluster having a fractal structure has emerged. Therefore, the graph structural complexity allows us to detect and study the processes similar to a second-order phase transition in complex networks. A new node centrality index, characterizing the structural complexity of a certain node within the graph structure is introduced also, it can serve as a good auxiliary or generalization to the local clustering coefficient. Such an index provides another new ranking manner for the graph nodes. Being an easily computable measure, the graph structural complexity might help to reveal different features of complex systems and processes of the real world.</description>

      <title>Universal behavior of the Covid-19 tails: Inverse power-law distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-law distribution is one of the most important laws known in nature. Such a special universal behavior is known to occur in very few physical systems. In this work, we analyzed the mortality distribution of the Covid-19 pandemic tails for different countries and continents to discuss the possible universal behavior of the pandemic. Surprisingly, we found that the mortality distribution of Covid-19 follows inverse power-law decays. These universal behaviors for the pandemic are reported in the present work for the first time. Additionally, we showed that mortality tails also decay with time obeying to the inverse power law.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility to Misinformation about COVID-19 Vaccines: A Signal Detection Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis drawing on Signal Detection Theory suggests that people may fall for misinformation because they are unable to discern true from false information (truth insensitivity) or because they tend to accept information with a particular slant regardless of whether it is true or false (belief bias). Three preregistered experiments with participants from the United States and the United Kingdom (N = 961) revealed that (i) truth insensitivity in responses to (mis)information about COVID-19 vaccines differed as a function of prior attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines; (ii) participants exhibited a strong belief bias favoring attitude-congruent information; (iii) truth insensitivity and belief bias jointly predicted acceptance of false information about COVID-19 vaccines, but belief bias was a much stronger predictor; (iv) cognitive elaboration increased truth sensitivity without reducing belief bias; and (v) higher levels of confidence in one's beliefs were associated with greater belief bias. The findings provide insights into why people fall for misinformation, which is essential for individual-level interventions to reduce susceptibility to misinformation.</description>

      <title>Apparent structural changes in contact patterns during COVID-19 were driven by survey design and long-term demographic trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social contact patterns are key drivers of infectious disease transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, differences between pre-COVID and COVID-era contact rates were widely attributed to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns. However, the factors that drive changes in the distribution of contacts between different subpopulations remain poorly understood. Here, we present a clustering analysis of 33 contact matrices generated from surveys conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and analyse key features distinguishing their topological structures. While we expected to identify aspects of pandemic scenarios responsible for these features, our analysis demonstrates that they can be explained by differences in study design and long-term demographic trends. Our results caution against using survey data from different studies in counterfactual analysis of epidemic mitigation strategies. Doing so risks attributing differences stemming from methodological choices or long-term changes to the short-term effects of interventions.</description>

      <title>The Entropy of Knowledge (EoN): Complexity, Uncertainty, and the Quest for Scientific Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of "entropy of knowledge" (EoN) as a framework for understanding the challenges and complexities of scientific discovery. Drawing from principles in thermodynamics and information theory, I propose that the pursuit of knowledge is characterized by a natural tendency towards disorder, uncertainty, and false conclusions. My central argument is that this entropy of knowledge is not merely an obstacle to be overcome but a fundamental feature of the scientific process, necessary for the exploration of new ideas and the ultimate attainment of truth. The implications of this perspective for the management of scientific inquiry is considered and the same suggests a cyclical approach that balances periods of openness and disorder with phases of consolidation and consensus-building. An attempt is made to situate the EoM model within the broader context of theories of scientific progress, drawing connections to Thomas Kuhn's concept of paradigm shifts and the notion of punctuated equilibrium in the history of science.</description>

      <title>Traffic Response Functions: Patterns, Propagation and Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using empirical data gathered on motorways in Germany, we follow a new approach by further exploring response functions as a possible tool to study traffic dynamics in motorway networks. We uncover the basic characteristics of responses of flow and density to given signals and the capability of responses to capture the correlation between these fundamental observables. Furthermore, we uncover the potential use of responses to characterize traffic patterns. We are able to demonstrate the differentiation of congestion patterns and the determination of the propagation velocity of moving congestion.</description>

      <title>The influence of active agent motility on SIRS epidemiological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Brownian disks moving in two dimensions that exchange information about their internal state stochastically are chosen to model epidemic spread in a self-propelled population of agents under the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) framework. The state of infection of an agent, or disk, governs its self-propulsion speed; consequently, the activity of the agents in the system varies in time. Two different protocols (one-to-one and one-to-many) are considered for the transmission of disease from the infected to susceptible populations. The effectiveness of the two protocols are practically identical at high values of the infection transmission rate. The one-to-many protocol, however, outperforms the one-to-one protocol at lower values of the infection transmission rate. Salient features of the macroscopic SIRS model are revisited, and compared to predictions from the agent-based model. Lastly, the motility induced phase separation in a population of such agents with a fluctuating fraction of active disks is found to be well-described by theories governing phase separation in a mixture of active and passive particles with a constant fraction of passive disks.</description>

      <title>Backward bifurcation arising from decline of immunity against emerging infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decline of immunity is a phenomenon characterized by immunocompromised host and plays a crucial role in the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose an age-structured model with vaccination and reinfection of immune individuals. We prove that the disease-free equilibrium of the model undergoes backward and forward transcritical bifurcations at the critical value of the basic reproduction number for different values of parameters. We illustrate the results by numerical computations, and also find that the endemic equilibrium exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation on the extended branch of the forward transcritical bifurcation. These results allow us to understand the interplay between the decline of immunity and EIDs, and are able to provide strategies for mitigating the impact of EIDs on global health.</description>

      <title>Infection patterns in simple and complex contagion processes on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the interactions between individuals. The impact of the network structure on spreading process has been widely investigated, but not the reverse question: do different processes unfolding on a given network lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model's parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of models. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust across models and parameters. In complex contagion models instead, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, non-trivial dependencies on models parameters emerge, as the infection pattern depends on the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, slight parameter changes can significantly impact the spreading paths. Our results show that it is possible to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and inform us on the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature.</description>

      <title>A mobile observer method for the estimation of road traffic using communicating vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of road traffic is a fundamental problem which has been addressed with a variety of methods. In the present paper, a variant of the mobile observer method is proposed. It is assumed that some vehicles composing the road traffic are communicating vehicles. These communicating vehicles broadcast periodically beacon messages. The proposed method uses only these beacon messages as input data, and needs no additional equipment such as radar or GPS device in order to estimate the road traffic. The model is tested with the bi-directional simulation framework VEINS, which combines a microscopic road traffic simulator and a communication simulator. The preliminary results show the potential of the method and confirm the validity of the approach.</description>

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. Many decisions require a qualified majority: the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution, based on the Shapley-Shubik index, and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with about 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The level of decisiveness decreases if the population criterion is above 68\% or the states criterion is at least 17. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley-Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable to evaluate any proposal for reforming the qualified majority voting system.</description>
