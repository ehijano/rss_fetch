      <title>A path towards AI-scale, interoperable biological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biology is at the precipice of a new era where AI accelerates and amplifies the ability to study how cells operate, organize, and work as systems, revealing why disease happens and how to correct it. Organizations globally are prioritizing AI to accelerate basic research, drug discovery, personalized medicine, and synthetic biology. However, despite these opportunities, scientific data have proven a bottleneck, and progress has been slow and fragmented. Unless the scientific community takes a technology-led, community-focused approach to scaling and harnessing data, we will fail to capture this opportunity to drive new insights and biological discovery. The data bottleneck presents a unique paradox. It is increasingly simple to generate huge data volumes, thanks to expanding imaging datasets and plummeting sequencing costs, but scientists lack standards and tooling for large biological datasets, preventing integration into a multimodal foundational dataset that unlocks generalizable models of cellular and tissue function. This contradiction highlights two interrelated problems: abundant data that's difficult to manage, and a lack of data resources with necessary quality and utility to realize AI's potential in biology. Science must forge a collective approach enabling distributed contributions to combine into cohesive, powerful datasets transcending individual purposes. Here, we present a technological and data generation roadmap for scaling scientific impact. We outline AI's opportunity, mechanisms to scale data generation, the need for multi-modal measurements, and means to pool resources, standardize approaches, and collectively build the foundation enabling AI's full potential in biological discovery.</description>

      <title>Rapid Development of Omics Data Analysis Applications through Vibe Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building custom data analysis platforms traditionally requires extensive software engineering expertise, limiting accessibility for many researchers. Here, I demonstrate that modern large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents can dramatically lower this barrier through a process called 'vibe coding', an iterative, conversational style of software creation where users describe goals in natural language and AI agents generate, test, and refine executable code in real-time. As a proof of concept, I used Vibe coding to create a fully functional proteomics data analysis website capable of performing standard tasks, including data normalization, differential expression testing, and volcano plot visualization. The entire application, including user interface, backend logic, and data upload pipeline, was developed in less than ten minutes using only four natural-language prompts, without any manual coding, at a cost of under $2. Previous works in this area typically require tens of thousands of dollars in research effort from highly trained programmers. I detail the step-by-step generation process and evaluate the resulting code's functionality. This demonstration highlights how vibe coding enables domain experts to rapidly prototype sophisticated analytical tools, transforming the pace and accessibility of computational biology software development.</description>

      <title>Isotropy and Geometry of Pretrained Protein LMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pretrained language models have transformed natural language processing, and their adaptation to protein sequences -- viewed as strings of amino acid characters -- has advanced protein analysis. However, the distinct properties of proteins, such as variable sequence lengths and lack of word-sentence analogs, necessitate a deeper understanding of protein language models (LMs). We investigate the isotropy of protein LM embedding spaces using average pairwise cosine similarity and the IsoScore method, revealing that models like ProtBERT and ProtXLNet are highly anisotropic, utilizing only 2--14 dimensions for global and local representations. In contrast, multi-modal training in ProteinBERT, which integrates sequence and gene ontology data, enhances isotropy, suggesting that diverse biological inputs improve representational efficiency. We also find that embedding distances weakly correlate with alignment-based similarity scores, particularly at low similarity.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Fidelity and Diversity in the Evolution of the Genetic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and organizing principles of the genetic code remain fundamental puzzles in life science. The vanishingly low probability of the natural codon-to-amino acid mapping arising by chance has spurred the hypothesis that its structure is a solution optimized for robustness against mutations and translational errors. For the construction of effective molecular machines, the dictionary of encoded amino acids must also be diverse enough in physicochemical features. Here, we examine whether the standard genetic code can be understood as a near-optimal solution balancing these two objectives: minimizing error load and aligning codon assignments with the naturally occurring amino acid composition. Using simulated annealing, we explore this trade-off across a broad range of parameters. We find that the standard genetic code lies near local optima within the multidimensional parameter space. It is a highly effective solution that balances fidelity against resource availability constraints. These results suggest that the present genetic code reflects coevolution under conflicting pressures of fidelity and diversity, offering new insight into its emergence and evolution.</description>
