      <title>Mathematical modelling and uncertainty quantification for analysis of biphasic coral reef recovery patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coral reefs are increasingly subjected to major disturbances threatening the health of marine ecosystems. Substantial research underway to develop intervention strategies that assist reefs in recovery from, and resistance to, inevitable future climate and weather extremes. To assess potential benefits of interventions, mechanistic understanding of coral reef recovery and resistance patterns is essential. Recent evidence suggests that more than half of the reefs surveyed across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) exhibit deviations from standard recovery modelling assumptions when the initial coral cover is low ($\leq 10$\%). New modelling is necessary to account for these observed patterns to better inform management strategies. We consider a new model for reef recovery at the coral cover scale that accounts for biphasic recovery patterns. The model is based on a multispecies Richards' growth model that includes a change point in the recovery patterns. Bayesian inference is applied for uncertainty quantification of key parameters for assessing reef health and recovery patterns. This analysis is applied to benthic survey data from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS). We demonstrate agreement between model predictions and data across every recorded recovery trajectory with at least two years of observations following disturbance events occurring between 1992--2020. This new approach will enable new insights into the biological, ecological and environmental factors that contribute to the duration and severity of biphasic coral recovery patterns across the GBR. These new insights will help to inform managements and monitoring practice to mitigate the impacts of climate change on coral reefs.</description>

      <title>Predator-prey density-dependent branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two density-dependent branching processes are considered to model predator-prey populations. For both models, preys are considered to be the main food supply of predators. Moreover, in each generation the number of individuals of each species is distributed according to a binomial distribution with size given by the species population size and probability of success depending on the density of preys per predator at the current generation. The difference between the two proposed processes lies in the food supply of preys. In the first one, we consider that preys have all the food they need at their disposal while in the second one, we assume that the natural resources of the environment are limited and therefore there exists a competition among preys for food supplies. Results on the fixation and extinction of both species as well as conditions for the coexistence are provided for the first model. On the event of coexistence of both populations and on the prey fixation event, the limiting growth rates are obtained. For the second model, we prove that the extinction of the entire system occurs almost surely. Finally, the evolution of both models over the generations is illustrated by simulated examples. Those examples validate our analytical findings.</description>
