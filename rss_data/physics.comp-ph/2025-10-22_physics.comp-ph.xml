      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solid Boundary Treatment in Meshfree Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meshfree particle methods, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method, are widely used to simulate complex free-surface and multiphase flows. A key challenge in these methods is the treatment of solid boundaries, where kernel truncation causes errors and instabilities. Traditional treatments, such as ghost particles and semi-analytical wall corrections, restore kernel completeness but add significant computational cost and complexity, especially for irregular geometries. We propose a physics-informed machine learning (ML) framework that directly predicts boundary correction terms for particle approximations, eliminating the need for ghost particles or analytical corrections. The framework is based on a hybrid convolutional neural network-multilayer perceptron (CNN-MLP) trained on physics-informed features that capture local geometry, particle states, and kernel properties. Once trained, it provides consistent boundary contributions across all spatial differential operators, including gradients, divergences, and Laplacians. The approach is demonstrated with MPS but is readily extensible to other particle methods such as SPH. Tests with predefined fields, unsteady diffusion, and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows demonstrate accuracy comparable to that of ghost-particle methods while reducing computational overhead. The model generalizes well to unseen geometries, flow conditions, and particle distributions, including dynamically evolving domains. This work establishes a flexible, physics-informed ML paradigm for boundary treatment in particle-based PDE solvers, improving both accuracy and scalability across a broad class of meshfree methods.</description>

      <title>Committors without Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18018v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</description>

      <title>Special Relativistic Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Based on Riemann Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel numerical method based on Godunov Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for special relativistic fluid dynamics. Our method utilizes a Riemann solver to describe shock, enhancing accuracy in strong shock waves. The formulation maintains conservation laws and achieves higher accuracy through convolution integrals that define physical quantities for SPH particles. We also propose the number density calculation method that uses a non-equal baryon number in each SPH particle and variable smoothing length in a way different from the conventional method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's robustness across one- and two-dimensional relativistic shock tube problems, as well as its ability to simulate Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities accurately, validating SRGSPH as a reliable approach for high-resolution relativistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Inverse analysis for the identification of temporal and spatial characteristics of a short super-Gaussian laser pulse interacting with a solid plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the results of numerical experiments verifying a novel setup for laser beam profiling are presented. The experimental setup is based on infrared thermography and includes laser beam illuminating a thin metal plate. The method allows to determine four parameters of the short high-power laser pulse, namely the Super-Gaussian profile coefficient, laser power, pulse start time and duration. The unknown parameters are retrieved based on temporal and spatial temperature distributions at the rear side of the illuminated plate. The applied inverse method is based on Levenberg-Marquardt technique and it is implemented in the GNU Octave environment. Solutions of the forward problem are obtained numerically, with the aid of three-dimensional transient heat transfer model implemented in the commercial software ANSYS Fluent. The paper presents the results of the sensitivity analysis as well as calibration and verification of the developed inverse algorithm through application of numerically-generated synthetic data. Strengths and weaknesses of the applied approach are widely discussed.</description>

      <title>LENNs: Locally Enhanced Neural Networks for High-Fidelity Modeling in Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite prior advances in PINNs, significant challenges remain in localized solid mechanics problems because of the limitations of single network formulations in simultaneous resolution of smooth global responses and near-tip singularities, and inadequacy in discontinuity representation, leading to unstable training and limited accuracy. To address the challenges, we propose Locally Enhanced Neural Networks (LENNs) that characterize localized discontinuities in solid mechanics via multilevel modeling. In particular, this novel framework employs a global network for the bulk solution and activates a local network in localized area for non-smooth response, coupled through a smooth window function that enables weighted superposition of local and global solutions. Moreover, the local network embeds additional functions that encode the discontinuous information into the input to capture localized non-smooth mechanical behaviors. Finally, the composite solution is substituted into the total potential energy functional for unified optimization. With this structure, the method resolves the conflict of single network in representing both smooth global and singular local fields without additional interface-loss terms and amplifies the contribution of localized critical features in energy optimization. We focus on a series of numerical experiments in solid mechanics to demonstrate the performance of the method. Results show that LENNs perform well in addressing localized discontinuous problems and provide accurate predictions for both displacement and stress fields.</description>

      <title>Stable rational approximations for parabolic equation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern parabolic equation (PE) methods for wave propagation rely on application of a variety of fractional-powered differential operators. Rational approximations of these operators need to properly map their spectra onto the complex plane, accurately handling propagating modes while annihilating evanescent ones. Standard approaches for stable and accurate rational approximations include rotating the branch cut of the operators or imposing stability constraint equations, and have yielded accurate results for wave propagation in a variety of fluid, elastic, and fluid-elastic waveguides. The stability constraint method, however, does not yield operators that are stable for all fluid-elastic waveguides, and a recent study of waveguides comprised of a thin elastic layer overlaying a thick fluid layer revealed instabilities in the approximations derived from rotated operators. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of a different rational approximation method, the recently-developed adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm, to simulations of wave propagation using the fluid-elastic parabolic equation. We find that simulations using operators approximated using the AAA algorithm provide excellent agreement with reference solutions, with errors in transmission loss comparable to, and often less than, that of simulations using the rotated operator method. In addition, we find that the AAA algorithm allows for the application of the split-step Pad\'e method to fluid-elastic waveguides, which yields a large gain in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for the Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite element method (FEM) is a cornerstone numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we present $\textbf{Qu-FEM}$, a fault-tolerant era quantum algorithm for the finite element method. In contrast to other quantum PDE solvers, Qu-FEM preserves the geometric flexibility of FEM by introducing two new primitives, the unit of interaction and the local-to-global indicator matrix, which enable the assembly of global finite element arrays with a constant-size linear combination of unitaries. We study the modified Poisson equation as an elliptic problem of interest, and provide explicit circuits for Qu-FEM in Cartesian domains. For problems with constant coefficients, our algorithm admits block-encodings of global arrays that require only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(d^2 p^2 n\right)$ Clifford+$T$ gates for $d$-dimensional, order-$p$ tensor product elements on grids with $2^n$ degrees of freedom in each dimension, where $n$ is the number of qubits representing the $N=2^n$ discrete grid points. For problems with spatially varying coefficients, we perform numerical integration directly on the quantum computer to assemble global arrays and force vectors. Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced via the method of Lagrange multipliers, eliminating the need to modify the block-encodings that emerge from the assembly procedure. This work presents a framework for extending the geometric flexibility of quantum PDE solvers while preserving the possibility of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of nonmonotonic quantum natural gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural gradient is an advanced optimization method based on information geometry, where the Fisher metric plays a crucial role.
  Its quantum counterpart, known as quantum natural gradient (QNG), employs the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, one of the quantum Fisher metrics.
  While quantization in physics is typically well-defined via the canonical commutation relations, the quantization of information-theoretic quantities introduces inherent arbitrariness.
  To resolve this ambiguity, monotonicity has been used as a guiding principle for constructing geometries in physics, as it aligns with physical intuition.
  Recently, a variant of QNG, which we refer to as nonmonotonic QNG in this paper, was proposed by relaxing the monotonicity condition.
  It was shown to achieve faster convergence compared to conventional QNG.
  In this paper, we investigate the properties of nonmonotonic QNG.
  To ensure the paper is self-contained, we first demonstrate that the SLD metric is locally optimal under the monotonicity condition and that non-monotone quantum Fisher metrics can lead to faster convergence in QNG.
  Previous studies primarily relied on a specific type of quantum divergence and assumed that density operators are full-rank.
  Here, we explicitly consider an alternative quantum divergence and extend the analysis to non-full-rank cases.
  Additionally, we explore how geometries can be designed using Petz functions, given that quantum Fisher metrics are characterized through them.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations comparing different quantum Fisher metrics in the context of parameter estimation problems in quantum circuit learning.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GoodRegressor, a general-purpose, C++-based symbolic regression framework for interpretable materials modeling, is presented. The workflow consists of five modules, parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer (as a post-process), that systematically explore descriptor combinations, nonlinear transformations, and interaction terms to construct compact and physically interpretable models. Applied to oxygen-ion conductors, the framework successfully predicts activation energies and Arrhenius prefactors with high accuracy ($R^2=0.804$ and $R^2=0.723$, respectively) and reveals clear physical trends linking ionic transport (particularly activation energy) to coordination environment, elastic moduli, and lattice flexibility. GoodRegressor bridges data-driven prediction and physical understanding, providing a transparent and extensible platform for symbolic regression applicable across diverse materials systems.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics for Mesoscale Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) is a widely used particle-based method for modelling soft matter systems at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales, offering thermodynamic consistency and direct control over the fluid's transport properties. Here, we present an SDPD model that incorporates the transport of reactants on scales smaller than the discretising particles, including the evolution of compositional fields. The proposed methodology is well-suited for modelling complex systems governed by advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics. Implemented in LAMMPS, the model is validated using a range of benchmark problems spanning diffusion-dominated, reaction-dominated, and coupled ADR regimes. Our simulation results demonstrate that the implemented SDPD model effectively captures complex behaviours, such as Turing pattern formation. The proposed model holds promise for applications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, and environmental engineering.</description>

      <title>Stability Criteria and Optoelectronic Properties of Mg3ZBr3 (Z = As, Sb, Bi) Perovskites for Evaluating the Performance in PIN Photo Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The toxicity and stability issues of lead-based perovskites motivate the search for non-toxic, durable alternatives. This work examines lead-free $\mathrm{Mg_3ZBr_3}$ ($Z=\mathrm{As,Sb,Bi}$) halide perovskites as optoelectronic materials, with emphasis on $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$. First-principles calculations establish cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ frameworks stabilized by strong Mg--Br linkages, and indirect band gaps of $2.0645\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and $1.6533\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$ obtained using hybrid functionals. Optical spectra show a rapid rise in absorption above the gap and an increasing static dielectric response along $\mathrm{As}\rightarrow\mathrm{Sb}\rightarrow\mathrm{Bi}$, indicating strengthened light--matter coupling. Phonon dispersions lack imaginary branches, confirming dynamical stability, and exhibit large mode anharmonicity (Gr\"uneisen signatures) consistent with soft-lattice heat transport. Moving down the pnictogen series expands the lattice and lowers the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, while enhanced pnictogen--Br $p$-orbital hybridization and stereochemically active $n\mathrm{s}^{2}$ lone pairs (Sb, Bi) narrow the band gap and increase the optical dielectric response. Elastic analyses confirm Born stability and moderate stiffness, with Hill-averaged bulk moduli decreasing from approximately $44\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$) to $35\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3BiBr_3}$). Drift--diffusion $p$--$i$--$n$ simulations qualitatively track band-edge-limited spectra, aligning with the computed gaps. Together, these results position these materials as promising lead-free candidates for stable thin-film photodiode and photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of Sr2PrSbO6 Double Perovskite: An Emerging Aspirant for Electrocatalysis, Plasmonic, Photonics, Thermoelectric and Solar Cell Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the structural properties, chemical stability, and electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ using first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). The goal of this study is to evaluate its potential contribution to next-generation electrocatalysts, optoelectronic devices, and thermoelectric systems. The structural optimization reveals that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ crystallizes in a stable cubic perovskite structure with space group $Fm\bar{3}m$. The calculated formation energy indicates high thermodynamic stability, confirming the viability of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ for practical applications. The electronic band structure calculations show that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap of $3.488~\mathrm{eV}$ at the $\Gamma$-point. The calculated density of states (DOS) indicates significant contributions from O $2p$, Sb $5p$, and Pr $5d$ orbitals. Optical property calculations, including the dielectric function and absorption coefficient, reveal strong absorption in the UV regions, making $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications such as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) tandem systems. At room temperature, the calculated dimensionless quantity $ZT$ is $0.33$, which indicates this material as a possible candidate for thermoelectric applications. Our results will serve as a benchmark for future experimental and theoretical research on the properties of this material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18623v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Flapping Foils Undergoing Irregular Motion with Application to Wave-Assisted Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flapping foils are widely studied as bioinspired propulsors, yet most investigations have focused on regular, sinusoidal kinematics. In realistic environments, however, irregular motions arise naturally due to environmental disturbances, fluid-structure interactions, and control inputs, but their hydrodynamic consequences remain largely unexplored. One system where response to irregular forcing is particularly relevant is wave-assisted propulsion (WAP) systems where free-to-pitch submerged foils generate thrust due to wave-induced heaving. We employ time-accurate flow simulations of elliptic WAP foils subjected to irregular waves at three different sea-states to gain insights into this system. Our results demonstrate that irregular heaving and pitching can generate greater mean thrust than energetically equivalent sinusoidal heaving. Moreover, a spring-based pitch-limiting mechanism yields higher thrust than an angle-limiter under the same conditions. By leveraging a previously developed leading-edge vortex (LEV) model, we uncover the mechanisms driving this thrust enhancement and highlight the critical interactions between unsteady flow structures and foil dynamics. These findings provide new insights into flapping-foil propulsion in irregular environments and have direct implications for the design and optimization of WAP systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive hyperviscosity stabilisation for the RBF-FD method in solving advection-dominated transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive hyperviscosity stabilisation procedure for the Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method, aimed at solving linear and non-linear advection-dominated transport equations on domains without a boundary. The approach employs a PDE-independent algorithm that adaptively determines the hyperviscosity constant based on the spectral radius of the RBF-FD evolution matrix. The proposed procedure supports general node layouts and is not tailored for specific equations, avoiding the limitations of empirical tuning and von Neumann-based estimates. To reduce computational cost, it is shown that lower monomial augmentation in the approximation of the hyperviscosity operator can still ensure consistent stabilisation, enabling the use of smaller stencils and improving overall efficiency. A hybrid strategy employing different spline orders for the advection and hyperviscosity operators is also implemented to enhance stability. The method is evaluated on pure linear advection and non-linear Burgers' equation, demonstrating stable performance with limited numerical dissipation. The two main contributions are: (1) a general hyperviscosity RBF-FD solution procedure demonstrated on both linear and non-linear advection-dominated problems, and (2) an in-depth analysis of the behaviour of hyperviscosity within the RBF-FD framework, addressing the interplay between key free parameters and their influence on numerical results.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Model for Gate Control of Narrow-, Broken-, and Inverted-Gap (Topological) Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even small electrostatic potentials can dramatically influence the band structure of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials. A quantitative understanding often necessitates a self-consistent Hartree approach. The valence and conduction band states strongly hybridize and/or cross in these systems. This makes distinguishing between electrons and holes impossible and the assumption of a flat charge carrier distribution at the charge neutrality point hard to justify. Consequently the wide-gap approach often fails in these systems. An alternative is the full-band envelope-function approach by Andlauer and Vogl, which has been implemented into the open-source software package kdotpy (arXiv:2407.12651). We show that this approach and implementation gives numerically stable and quantitatively accurate results where the conventional method fails by modeling the experimental subband density evolution with top-gate voltage in thick (26 nm - 110 nm), topologically inverted HgTe quantum wells. We expect our openly-available implementation to greatly benefit the investigation of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials.</description>

      <title>PCMS: Parallel Coupler For Multimodel Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Parallel Coupler for Multimodel Simulations (PCMS), a new GPU accelerated generalized coupling framework for coupling simulation codes on leadership class supercomputers. PCMS includes distributed control and field mapping methods for up to five dimensions. For field mapping PCMS can utilize discretization and field information to accommodate physics constraints. PCMS is demonstrated with a coupling of the gyrokinetic microturbulence code XGC with a Monte Carlo neutral transport code DEGAS2 and with a 5D distribution function coupling of an energetic particle transport code (GNET) to a gyrokinetic microturbulence code (GTC). Weak scaling is also demonstrated on up to 2,080 GPUs of Frontier with a weak scaling efficiency of 85%.</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic propagation method beyond the sequential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ stochastic propagation method, which relies on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation using random initial states, is widely used in large-scale first-principles calculations. In this work, we eliminate the conventional sequential computation of intermediate states by introducing a concurrent strategy that minimizes information redundancy. The new method, in its state-, moment-, and energy-based implementations, not only surpasses the time step constraint of sequential propagation but also maintains precision within the framework of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Systematic benchmarking on one billion atoms within the tight-binding model demonstrates that our new concurrent method achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup, enabling the rapid computation of a wide range of electronic, optical, and transport properties. This performance breakthrough offers valuable insights for enhancing other time-propagation algorithms, including those employed in large-scale stochastic density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of a multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model. The model consists of cathode, discharge, and plume sub-models and outputs thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume. The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster operating on krypton, the H9, and an unshielded thruster operating on xenon, the SPT-100, at pressures between 4.3--43 $\mu$Torr-Kr and 1.7--80 $\mu$Torr-Xe, respectively. After calibration, the model captures key pressure-related trends, including changes in thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\% when evaluated on flow rates and pressures not included in the training data, and can predict some performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range of conditions. Compared to a previous model calibrated on some of the same data [Eckels et al. 2024], the model reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%. An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9%, capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. These findings are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall thruster modeling in the presence of facility effects.</description>

      <title>Finite density nuclear matter and neutron stars in hard-wall AdS/QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of nuclear matter, equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars and its mass-radius relation in a hard-wall AdS/QCD model by regarding baryons as solitonic configurations in gauge fields. Compared with previous approaches, we employ a different homogeneous approximation that takes into account the equations of motion for the pure gauge fields. By choosing appropriate parameters, we realize a chiral phase transition within the baryonic phase, where the chiral condensate decreases with the baryon chemical potential, until it reaches zero -- chiral symmetry is restored. In addition, independent of the existence of chiral phase transition, we also find that the speed of sound converges to the conformal limit at the density relevant to cores of massive stars but the trace of energy-momentum tensor does not vanish which indicates the pseudoconformal structure and intrinsic manifestation of scale symmetry in compact star matter. Through calculations, we obtain an equation of state that is more tightly constrained than previous works, and the resulting mass-radius relation of neutron stars is consistent with current observations.</description>

      <title>Automotive Crash Dynamics Modeling Accelerated with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>
