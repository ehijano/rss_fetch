      <title>Conversational Text Extraction with Large Language Models Using Retrieval-Augmented Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract text and enhance user interaction with PDF documents via a conversational interface. Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system provides informative responses to user inquiries while highlighting relevant passages within the PDF. Upon user upload, the system processes the PDF, employing sentence embeddings to create a document-specific vector store. This vector store enables efficient retrieval of pertinent sections in response to user queries. The LLM then engages in a conversational exchange, using the retrieved information to extract text and generate comprehensive, contextually aware answers. While our approach demonstrates competitive ROUGE values compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques for text extraction and summarization, we acknowledge that further qualitative evaluation is necessary to fully assess its effectiveness in real-world applications. The proposed system gives competitive ROUGE values as compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques for text extraction and summarization, thus offering a valuable tool for researchers, students, and anyone seeking to efficiently extract knowledge and gain insights from documents through an intuitive question-answering interface.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evaluation of Embedding Models in the Context of Text Classification in Document Review in Construction Delay Disputes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text embeddings are numerical representations of text data, where words, phrases, or entire documents are converted into vectors of real numbers. These embeddings capture semantic meanings and relationships between text elements in a continuous vector space. The primary goal of text embeddings is to enable the processing of text data by machine learning models, which require numerical input. Numerous embedding models have been developed for various applications. This paper presents our work in evaluating different embeddings through a comprehensive comparative analysis of four distinct models, focusing on their text classification efficacy. We employ both K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to perform binary classification tasks, specifically determining whether a text snippet is associated with 'delay' or 'not delay' within a labeled dataset. Our research explores the use of text snippet embeddings for training supervised text classification models to identify delay-related statements during the document review process of construction delay disputes. The results of this study highlight the potential of embedding models to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of document analysis in legal contexts, paving the way for more informed decision-making in complex investigative scenarios.</description>

      <title>PaSa: An LLM Agent for Comprehensive Academic Paper Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PaSa, an advanced Paper Search agent powered by large language models. PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholarly queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4 for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o). Notably, PaSa-7B surpasses the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50. It also exceeds PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. Model, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/bytedance/pasa.</description>

      <title>A Worrying Reproducibility Study of Intent-Aware Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lately, we have observed a growing interest in intent-aware recommender systems (IARS). The promise of such systems is that they are capable of generating better recommendations by predicting and considering the underlying motivations and short-term goals of consumers. From a technical perspective, various sophisticated neural models were recently proposed in this emerging and promising area. In the broader context of complex neural recommendation models, a growing number of research works unfortunately indicates that (i) reproducing such works is often difficult and (ii) that the true benefits of such models may be limited in reality, e.g., because the reported improvements were obtained through comparisons with untuned or weak baselines. In this work, we investigate if recent research in IARS is similarly affected by such problems. Specifically, we tried to reproduce five contemporary IARS models that were published in top-level outlets, and we benchmarked them against a number of traditional non-neural recommendation models. In two of the cases, running the provided code with the optimal hyperparameters reported in the paper did not yield the results reported in the paper. Worryingly, we find that all examined IARS approaches are consistently outperformed by at least one traditional model. These findings point to sustained methodological issues and to a pressing need for more rigorous scholarly practices.</description>

      <title>MechIR: A Mechanistic Interpretability Framework for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging diagnostic approach for neural models that has gained traction in broader natural language processing domains. This paradigm aims to provide attribution to components of neural systems where causal relationships between hidden layers and output were previously uninterpretable. As the use of neural models in IR for retrieval and evaluation becomes ubiquitous, we need to ensure that we can interpret why a model produces a given output for both transparency and the betterment of systems. This work comprises a flexible framework for diagnostic analysis and intervention within these highly parametric neural systems specifically tailored for IR tasks and architectures. In providing such a framework, we look to facilitate further research in interpretable IR with a broader scope for practical interventions derived from mechanistic interpretability. We provide preliminary analysis and look to demonstrate our framework through an axiomatic lens to show its applications and ease of use for those IR practitioners inexperienced in this emerging paradigm.</description>

      <title>A Simple but Effective Closed-form Solution for Extreme Multi-label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme multi-label learning (XML) is a task of assigning multiple labels from an extremely large set of labels to each data instance. Many current high-performance XML models are composed of a lot of hyperparameters, which complicates the tuning process. Additionally, the models themselves are adapted specifically to XML, which complicates their reimplementation. To remedy this problem, we propose a simple method based on ridge regression for XML. The proposed method not only has a closed-form solution but also is composed of a single hyperparameter. Since there are no precedents on applying ridge regression to XML, this paper verified the performance of the method by using various XML benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we enhanced the prediction of low-frequency labels in XML, which hold informative content. This prediction is essential yet challenging because of the limited amount of data. Here, we employed a simple frequency-based weighting. This approach greatly simplifies the process compared with existing techniques. Experimental results revealed that it can achieve levels of performance comparable to, or even exceeding, those of models with numerous hyperparameters. Additionally, we found that the frequency-based weighting significantly improved the predictive performance for low-frequency labels, while requiring almost no changes in implementation. The source code for the proposed method is available on github at https://github.com/cars1015/XML-ridge.</description>

      <title>OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, utility, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, repetitive, and unoriginal outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they progressively deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Image-Based Narrative Extraction: A Case Study with Historical Photographic Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised approach to extracting narratives from historical photographic records using an adaptation of the narrative maps algorithm. We extend the original unsupervised text-based method to work with image data, leveraging deep learning techniques for visual feature extraction and similarity computation. Our method is applied to the ROGER dataset, a collection of photographs from the 1928 Sacambaya Expedition in Bolivia captured by Robert Gerstmann. We compare our algorithmically extracted visual narratives with expert-curated timelines of varying lengths (5 to 30 images) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to match the extracted narratives with the expert-curated baseline. In addition, we asked an expert on the topic to qualitatively evaluate a representative example of the resulting narratives. Our findings show that the narrative maps approach generally outperforms random sampling for longer timelines (10+ images, p &lt; 0.05), with expert evaluation confirming the historical accuracy and coherence of the extracted narratives. This research contributes to the field of computational analysis of visual cultural heritage, offering new tools for historians, archivists, and digital humanities scholars to explore and understand large-scale image collections. The method's ability to generate meaningful narratives from visual data opens up new possibilities for the study and interpretation of historical events through photographic evidence.</description>

      <title>Passage Segmentation of Documents for Extractive Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in open-domain question answering. However, the chunking process, which is essential to this pipeline, often receives insufficient attention relative to retrieval and synthesis components. This study emphasizes the critical role of chunking in improving the performance of both dense passage retrieval and the end-to-end RAG pipeline. We then introduce the Logits-Guided Multi-Granular Chunker (LGMGC), a novel framework that splits long documents into contextualized, self-contained chunks of varied granularity. Our experimental results, evaluated on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate that LGMGC not only improves the retrieval step but also outperforms existing chunking methods when integrated into a RAG pipeline.</description>

      <title>Tracing Affordance and Item Adoption on Music Streaming Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.03538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popular music streaming platforms offer users a diverse network of content exploration through a triad of affordances: organic, algorithmic and editorial access modes. Whilst offering great potential for discovery, such platform developments also pose the modern user with daily adoption decisions on two fronts: platform affordance adoption and the adoption of recommendations therein. Following a carefully constrained set of Deezer users over a 2-year observation period, our work explores factors driving user behaviour in the broad sense, by differentiating users on the basis of their temporal daily usage, adoption of the main platform affordances, and the ways in which they react to them, especially in terms of recommendation adoption. Diverging from a perspective common in studies on the effects of recommendation, we assume and confirm that users exhibit very diverse behaviours in using and adopting the platform affordances. The resulting complex and quite heterogeneous picture demonstrates that there is no blanket answer for adoption practices of both recommendation features and recommendations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing User Interest based on Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) provide personalized recommendation service based on user interest, which are widely used in various platforms. However, there are lots of users with sparse interest due to lacking consumption behaviors, which leads to poor recommendation results for them. This problem is widespread in large-scale RSs and is particularly difficult to address. To solve this problem, we propose a novel solution named User Interest Enhancement (UIE) which enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences using the enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vector generated based on stream clustering and memory networks from different perspectives. UIE not only remarkably improves model performance on the users with sparse interest but also significantly enhance model performance on other users. UIE is an end-to-end solution which is easy to be implemented based on ranking model. Moreover, we expand our solution and apply similar methods to long-tail items, which also achieves excellent improvement. Furthermore, we conduct extensive offline and online experiments in a large-scale industrial RS. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models remarkably, especially for the users with sparse interest. Until now, UIE has been fully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs and achieved remarkable improvements.</description>

      <title>News Without Borders: Domain Adaptation of Multilingual Sentence Embeddings for Cross-lingual News Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i) frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot news recommendation.</description>

      <title>Ranking Generated Answers: On the Agreement of Retrieval Models with Humans on Consumer Health Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the output of generative large language models (LLMs) is challenging and difficult to scale. Many evaluations of LLMs focus on tasks such as single-choice question-answering or text classification. These tasks are not suitable for assessing open-ended question-answering capabilities, which are critical in domains where expertise is required. One such domain is health, where misleading or incorrect answers can have a negative impact on a user's well-being. Using human experts to evaluate the quality of LLM answers is generally considered the gold standard, but expert annotation is costly and slow. We present a method for evaluating LLM answers that uses ranking models trained on annotated document collections as a substitute for explicit relevance judgements and apply it to the CLEF 2021 eHealth dataset. In a user study, our method correlates with the preferences of a human expert (Kendall's $\tau=0.64$). It is also consistent with previous findings in that the quality of generated answers improves with the size of the model and more sophisticated prompting strategies.</description>

      <title>Cold-Start Recommendation towards the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs): A Comprehensive Survey and Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold-start problem is one of the long-standing challenges in recommender systems, focusing on accurately modeling new or interaction-limited users or items to provide better recommendations. Due to the diversification of internet platforms and the exponential growth of users and items, the importance of cold-start recommendation (CSR) is becoming increasingly evident. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success and possess strong capabilities in modeling user and item information, providing new potential for cold-start recommendations. However, the research community on CSR still lacks a comprehensive review and reflection in this field. Based on this, in this paper, we stand in the context of the era of large language models and provide a comprehensive review and discussion on the roadmap, related literature, and future directions of CSR. Specifically, we have conducted an exploration of the development path of how existing CSR utilizes information, from content features, graph relations, and domain information, to the world knowledge possessed by large language models, aiming to provide new insights for both the research and industrial communities on CSR. Related resources of cold-start recommendations are collected and continuously updated for the community in https://github.com/YuanchenBei/Awesome-Cold-Start-Recommendation.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models into recommendation frameworks presents key advantages for personalization and adaptability of experiences to the users. Classic methods of recommendations, such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, are seriously limited in the solution of cold-start problems, sparsity of data, and lack of diversity in information considered. LLMs, of which GPT-4 is a good example, have emerged as powerful tools that enable recommendation frameworks to tap into unstructured data sources such as user reviews, social interactions, and text-based content. By analyzing these data sources, LLMs improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations, thereby overcoming some of the limitations of traditional approaches. This work discusses applications of LLMs in recommendation systems, especially in electronic commerce, social media platforms, streaming services, and educational technologies. This showcases how LLMs enrich recommendation diversity, user engagement, and the system's adaptability; yet it also looks into the challenges connected to their technical implementation. This can also be presented as a study that shows the potential of LLMs for changing user experiences and making innovation possible in industries.</description>

      <title>Enabling Low-Resource Language Retrieval: Establishing Baselines for Urdu MS MARCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12997</link>

Abstract: As the Information Retrieval (IR) field increasingly recognizes the importance of inclusivity, addressing the needs of low-resource languages remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the first large-scale Urdu IR dataset, created by translating the MS MARCO dataset through machine translation. We establish baseline results through zero-shot learning for IR in Urdu and subsequently apply the mMARCO multilingual IR methodology to this newly translated dataset. Our findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned model (Urdu-mT5-mMARCO) achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10) of 0.247 and a Recall@10 of 0.439, representing significant improvements over zero-shot results and showing the potential for expanding IR access for Urdu speakers. By bridging access gaps for speakers of low-resource languages, this work not only advances multilingual IR research but also emphasizes the ethical and societal importance of inclusive IR technologies. This work provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for improving language representation and lays the groundwork for future research, especially in South Asian languages, which can benefit from the adaptable methods used in this study.</description>
