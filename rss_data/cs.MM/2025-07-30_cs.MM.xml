      <title>Sync-TVA: A Graph-Attention Framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Cross-Modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However, existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA, an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.</description>

      <title>PC-JND: Subjective Study and Dataset on Just Noticeable Difference for Point Clouds in 6DoF Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Just Noticeable Difference (JND) accounts for the minimum distortion at which humans can perceive a difference between a pristine stimulus and its distorted version. The JND concept has been widely applied in visual signal processing tasks, including coding, transmission, rendering, and quality assessment, to optimize human-centric media experiences. A point cloud is a mainstream volumetric data representation consisting of both geometry information and attributes (e.g. color). Point clouds are used for advanced immersive 3D media such as Virtual Reality (VR). However, the JND characteristics of viewing point clouds in VR have not been explored before. In this paper, we study the point cloud-wise JND (PCJND) characteristics in a Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) VR environment using a head-mounted display. Our findings reveal that the texture PCJND of human eyes is smaller than the geometry PCJND for most point clouds. Furthermore, we identify a correlation between colorfulness and texture PCJND. However, there is no significant correlation between colorfulness and the geometry PCJND, nor between the number of points and neither the texture or geometry PCJND. To support future research in JND prediction and perception-driven signal processing, we introduce PC-JND, a novel point cloud-based JND dataset. This dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate advancements in perceptual optimization for immersive media.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sub-pixel Motion Compensation in Learned Video Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion compensation is a key component of video codecs. Conventional codecs (HEVC and VVC) have carefully refined this coding step, with an important focus on sub-pixel motion compensation. On the other hand, learned codecs achieve sub-pixel motion compensation through simple bilinear filtering. This paper offers to improve learned codec motion compensation by drawing inspiration from conventional codecs. It is shown that the usage of more advanced interpolation filters, block-based motion information and finite motion accuracy lead to better compression performance and lower decoding complexity. Experimental results are provided on the Cool-chic video codec, where we demonstrate a rate decrease of more than 10% and a lowering of motion-related decoding complexity from 391 MAC per pixel to 214 MAC per pixel.

      <title>Towards Universal Modal Tracking with Online Dense Temporal Token Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically, our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker} achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack.</description>

      <title>MaXsive: High-Capacity and Robust Training-Free Generative Image Watermarking in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks. Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID) collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of verification and identification.</description>

      <title>VAGU &amp; GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.</description>

      <title>MAGE: Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement via Bridging Visual and Semantic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.</description>

      <title>EEmo-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models on Image Evoked Emotion Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16405v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The furnishing of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has led to the emergence of numerous benchmark studies, particularly those evaluating their perception and understanding capabilities. Among these, understanding image-evoked emotions aims to enhance MLLMs' empathy, with significant applications such as human-machine interaction and advertising recommendations. However, current evaluations of this MLLM capability remain coarse-grained, and a systematic and comprehensive assessment is still lacking. To this end, we introduce EEmo-Bench, a novel benchmark dedicated to the analysis of the evoked emotions in images across diverse content categories. Our core contributions include: 1) Regarding the diversity of the evoked emotions, we adopt an emotion ranking strategy and employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) as emotional attributes for emotional assessment. In line with this methodology, 1,960 images are collected and manually annotated. 2) We design four tasks to evaluate MLLMs' ability to capture the evoked emotions by single images and their associated attributes: Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment. Additionally, image-pairwise analysis is introduced to investigate the model's proficiency in performing joint and comparative analysis. In total, we collect 6,773 question-answer pairs and perform a thorough assessment on 19 commonly-used MLLMs. The results indicate that while some proprietary and large-scale open-source MLLMs achieve promising overall performance, the analytical capabilities in certain evaluation dimensions remain suboptimal. Our EEmo-Bench paves the path for further research aimed at enhancing the comprehensive perceiving and understanding capabilities of MLLMs concerning image-evoked emotions, which is crucial for machine-centric emotion perception and understanding.</description>

      <title>Music-Aligned Holistic 3D Dance Generation via Hierarchical Motion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences.</description>

      <title>Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for 2D Long-Form Latent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.
