      <title>From ANN to BNN: Inferring Reionization Parameters using Uncertainty-aware Emulators of 21-cm Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring astrophysical parameters from radio interferometric observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a challenging yet crucial task. The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Field-level Reconstruction from Foreground-Contaminated 21-cm Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and upcoming 21-cm experiments will soon be able to map 21-cm spatial fluctuations in three dimensions for a wide range of redshifts. However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the "foreground wedge". In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.</description>

      <title>Effective bias expansion for circumventing 21 cm foregrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) but suffers from contamination by spectrally smooth foregrounds, which obscure the large-scale signal along the line of sight. We explore the possibility of indirectly extracting the 21 cm signal in the presence of foregrounds by taking advantage of nonlinear couplings between large and small scales, both at the level of the density field and a biased tracer of that field. When combined with effective field theory techniques, bias expansions allow for a systematic treatment of nonlinear mode-couplings in the map between the underlying density field and the 21 cm field. We apply an effective bias expansion to density information generated with $\texttt{21cmFAST}$ using a variety of assumptions about which information can be recovered by different surveys and density estimation techniques. We find that the 21 cm signal produced by our effective bias expansion, combined with our least optimistic foreground assumptions, produces ~30% cross-correlations with the true 21 cm field. Providing complementary density information from high-redshift galaxy surveys yields a cross-correlation of 50-70%. The techniques presented here may be combined with foreground mitigation strategies in order to improve the recovery of the large-scale 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>Beyond the two-point correlation: constraining primordial non-gaussianity with density perturbation moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) in the large-scale cosmic structure (LSS) is an important step in understanding properties of the early universe, specifically in distinguishing between different inflationary models. Measuring PNG relies on evaluating the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. New summary statistics beyond the two- and three-point correlation functions in configuration space and their Fourier-space counterparts, the power- and bi-spectrum may provide increased sensitivity. We introduce a new method for extracting the PNG signal imprinted on the LSS by using the first three Gaussian moments of the normalized correlation in density perturbations, evaluated at varying distance scales. We aim to assess this method's sensitivity to local PNG, parameterized by $f_ {\mathrm{NL}}$. We perform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo simulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. From these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model expectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Our method provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with respect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find that the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the mean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its simplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to current and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Compact Dark Matter Population from Micro-lensing Effect of Gravitational Wave for the third-generation gravitational Wave Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful tool for probing astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\log_{10}(f_{\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$.</description>

      <title>Is Phantom Barrier Crossing Inevitable? A Cosmographic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using multi-wavelength constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties by leveraging multi-wavelength synergies. This builds on our earlier study, where we developed the synergy between high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), 21-cm global signal non-detection from SARAS~3, and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, to constrain the astrophysical properties of Population II galaxies. Through a combination of CXB and HERA data, we find the IGM kinetic temperature to be $T_\text{K}(z=15)\lesssim 7.7~\text{K}$, $2.5~\text{K} \lesssim T_\text{K}(z=10) \lesssim 66~\text{K}$, and $20~\text{K}\lesssim T_\text{K}(z=6) \lesssim 2078~\text{K}$ at 95\% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data place an upper limit on the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving $T_\text{rad}(z=15) \lesssim 47~\text{K}$, $T_\text{rad}(z=10)\lesssim 51~\text{K}$, and $T_\text{rad}(z=6)\lesssim 101~\text{K}$. These constraints, strengthened by the inclusion of UVLFs from HST and JWST, allow us to place the first \textit{lower bound} on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth ${-201~\text{mK}\lesssim T_\text{21,min} \lesssim -68~\text{mK}}$ at $z_\text{min}\approx10-16$, and a power spectrum of $8.7~\text{mK}^2 &lt; \Delta_{21}^2(z=15) &lt; 197~\text{mK}^2$ at $k=0.35~h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our results provide promising predictions for upcoming 21-cm experiments, and highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Cosmological constraints from second and third-order shear statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of the third-order aperture mass statistic using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data. We perform a complete tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ as a practical observable for joint analyses in current and future surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from a joint analysis of second and third order shear statistics with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint cosmological analysis of the two-point correlation function and the aperture-mass skewness measured from the Year 3 data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-Y3). The aperture-mass skewness is a compressed representation of three-point shear information, designed to capture non-Gaussian features while keeping the data vector computationally tractable. We find that including the aperture-mass skewness improves the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ figure of merit by 80% compared to the 2PCF-only case, primarily due to the breaking of degeneracies. Our joint analysis yields a constraint of $S_8=0.736\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the two-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\sigma$ in the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to be internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect no significant intrinsic alignment signal. We also explore extensions to the $w$CDM model and find no evidence for deviations from a cosmological constant. This work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific value of incorporating third-order shear statistics into weak lensing cosmology and provides a practical pathway for similar analyses in future Stage-IV surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.</description>

      <title>Data Compression with Noise Suppression for Inference under Noisy Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many fields including cosmology, statistical inference often relies on Gaussian likelihoods whose covariance matrices are estimated from a finite number of simulations. This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the covariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the Dodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the Massively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm offers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate the DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy covariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered MOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information retention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law transformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against standard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey. Our results demonstrate that $p$-MOPED consistently outperforms other approaches, especially in regimes with limited simulations, offering a robust compression strategy for high-dimensional data analyses under practical constraints.</description>

      <title>Search for Light Inelastic Dark Matter with Low-Energy Ionization Signatures in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct detection of light dark matter (DM) is generally difficult due to its small recoil energy. The inelastic scattering of DM can produce unique signatures in the DM direct detection experiments. Using the low-energy unpaired ionization data from PandaX-4T, we newly analyze the probe of the exothermic inelastic dark matter (ineDM). We demonstrate that PandaX-4T can probe the ineDM mass-splitting down to 0.05 keV and probe the ineDM mass to the sub-GeV range. For the ineDM with a dark photon mediator, we use the PandaX-4T data to impose stringent bounds on the mixing parameter between the dark photon and photon.</description>

      <title>A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era</title>

Abstract: Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Starobinsky Inflation in No-Scale SU(5) and SO(10) GUTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original Starobinsky $R + R^2$ model of inflation is consistent with Planck and other measurements of the CMB, but recent results from the ACT and SPT Collaborations hint that the tilt of scalar perturbations may be in tension with the prediction of the Starobinsky model. No-scale models of inflation can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model, but also provide a framework for incorporating deformations that could accommodate more easily the ACT and SPT data. We discuss this possibility in the contexts of SU(5) GUTs, taking into account the constraints on these models imposed by the longevity of the proton, the cold dark matter density and the measured value of the Higgs boson. We find that SU(5) with a CMSSM-like pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking has difficulty in accommodating all the constraints, whereas SU(5) with pure gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking can accommodate them easily. We also consider two SO(10) symmetry-breaking patterns that can accommodate the ACT and SPT data. In both the SU(5) and SO(10) models, the deformations avoid issues associated with large initial field values in the Starobinsky model: in particular, the total number of e-folds is largely independent of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Polarimetric Structure of Jets from Radio Galaxy MRC 0600-399 in Abell 3376</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MRC 0600-399, in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376, is one of the unique Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, by using a sample of 2,170 systems with $M &gt; 10^{14}\, M_\odot$ selected from a publicly available group catalog based on the SDSS galaxy. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find strong statistical evidence for coherent rotation, with the observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution significantly exceeding randomized controls (nearly $\sim150\sigma$ confidence at $\sim380~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$), especially in richer clusters ($N_{\mathrm{gal}} &gt; 10$, up to $\sim300\sigma$). Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim330~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim800~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way is a less massive galaxy--new estimates of the Milky Way's local and global stellar masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\pm$2.813(syst.)$\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\pm$0.353(syst.)$\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\rm \times10^{10}M_{\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive binary black holes using the third data release (DR3) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of forming primordial black holes during a first-order phase transition in the early Universe. As is well known, such a phase transition proceeds through the formation of true-vacuum bubbles in a Universe that is still in a false vacuum. When there is a particle species whose mass increases significantly during the phase transition, transmission of the corresponding particles through the advancing bubble walls is suppressed. Consequently, an overdensity can build up in front of the walls and become sufficiently large to trigger primordial black hole formation. We track this process quantitatively by solving a Boltzmann equation, and we delineate the phase transition properties required for our mechanism to yield an appreciable abundance of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes could potentially form during a first-order cosmological phase transition due to a build-up of particles which are predominantly reflected from the advancing bubble walls. After discussing the general mechanism, we examine the criteria that need to be satisfied for a black hole to form. We then set out the Boltzmann equation that describes the evolution of the relevant phase space distribution function, carefully describing our treatment of the Liouville operator and the collision term. Assuming a spherical false vacuum pocket of sufficient size and a constant wall velocity, we find that black holes can form in a range of different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Local Primordial non-Gaussianity from Relativistic Effects in the Galaxy Bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys aim to map the Universe with unprecedented precision, depth and sky coverage. The galaxy bispectrum is a prime source of information as it allows us to probe primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), a key factor in differentiating various models of inflation. On the scales where local PNG is strongest, Doppler and other relativistic effects become important and need to be included. We investigate the detectability of relativistic and local PNG contributions in the galaxy bispectrum. We compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of the bispectrum including such effects. Furthermore, we perform information matrix forecasts on the local PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and on the parametrised amplitudes of the relativistic corrections. Finally, we quantify the bias on the measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$ that arises from neglecting relativistic effects. Our results show that detections of both first- and second-order relativistic effects are promising with forthcoming spectroscopic survey specifications -- and are largely unaffected by the uncertainty in $f_{\rm NL}$. Conversely, we show for the first time that neglecting relativistic corrections in the galaxy bispectrum can lead to $&gt;\!1.5\sigma(f_{\rm NL})$ shift on the detected value of $f_{\rm NL}$, highlighting the importance of including relativistic effects in our modelling.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing with upcoming wide-field radio surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of strong lensing systems will soon increase by orders of magnitude thanks to sensitive, wide-field optical and infrared imaging surveys such as Euclid, Rubin-LSST, and Roman. A dramatic increase in strong lenses will also occur at radio wavelengths. The 2000-antenna Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-2000) will detect $\sim10^9$ continuum sources in the Northern Hemisphere with a high mean redshift ($\langle z_s \rangle \approx2$), the Square Kilometre Array mid frequency telescope (SKA-Mid) will observe a large sample of extragalactic sources in the South with sub-arcsecond resolution, and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) has recently completed. We forecast lensing rates for these telescopes, finding that each of the DSA-2000 and SKA-Mid will conservatively discover $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ strongly lensed systems, and optimistically as many as $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$, a significant fraction of which will be galaxy group and cluster lenses. We propose strategies for strong lensing discovery in the limit where the Einstein radii are comparable to the PSF angular scale, taking advantage of modern computer vision techniques and multi-survey data. Finally, we describe applications of the expected radio strong lensing systems, including time-delay cosmography with transient and variable sources. We find that $\sim$30-300 time-variable flat-spectrum AGN discovered by the DSA-2000 and SKA-Mid could be used to constrain H_0$ at the percent level with the appropriate follow-up.</description>

      <title>Bounds on decaying sterile neutrinos via magnetic dipole moment from COB intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent observation by Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) mounted on NASA's New Horizons yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB). The reported COB intensity is $11.16\pm 1.35$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range \( 0.4 \, \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m} \). After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble Space Telescope count, diffused galactic light, and scattered light from bright star foregrounds, an anomalous intensity of $2.99 \pm 2.03~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. We considered radiatively decaying sterile neutrinos of keV mass scale, as dark matter candidate, that could contribute to this anomalous reported intensity. Using this, we derive upper bounds on the sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic moment. We find that sterile neutrinos with mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ scale take values of the transition magnetic moment in the range $ 3\times 10^{-13}\,\rm eV^{-1} - 10^{-9}\,\rm eV^{-1}$ to explain the anomalous intensity of $2.99\pm 2.03\,\rm nW/m^2/sr$. % Future experiments such as, Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical-UV Research (CASTOR), James Web Space Telescope (JWST), and Spectro-Photometer for the history of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) might help us derive a better bound on the sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A Universal Analytic Model for Gravitational Lensing by Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model for analytically calculating gravitational lensing by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. Leveraging the universal behavior of SIDM halos during gravothermal evolution, we calibrate the lensing potential using a fluid simulation, normalizing the evolution time to align with established scenarios. From this potential, we derive explicit equations for the deflection angle and surface density profile, quantifying their deviations from numerical results. Our model builds on the parametric approach of arXiv:2305.16176, providing refinements in the deep core-collapse regime and enabling more comprehensive lensing studies. We explore characteristic lensing features, including critical curves and caustics, for SIDM halos in isolation and within a main halo, tracking their evolution through the gravothermal phase. We also examine signatures in the self-similar regime of core collapsed halos and highlight the role of baryonic effects in realistic halos. The application of our model extends to generic halos, whose profiles fit one or a superposition of our parametric forms. We make our implementation publicly available on https://github.com/HouSiyuan2001/SIDM_Lensing_Model to support further research.</description>

Abstract: We present new, high frequency radio observations of the merging galaxy clusters PLCK G287.0+32.9, Abell 2744, and Bullet. These clusters are known to host $\sim$Mpc scale sources, known as radio halos, which are formed by the acceleration of cosmic rays by turbulence injected into the intracluster medium during cluster mergers. Our new images reveal previously undetected faint outermost regions of halos, extending to over 2 Mpc. This discovery highlights the presence of radio halos with large extents at high frequencies and suggests that their observable size depends on a combination of the observation sensitivity and uv-coverage, and their radio power. We additionally compare the properties of these three clusters with MACS J0717+3745 and Abell 2142, both of which are known to host prominent large radio halos. Remarkably, all five halos, despite their exceptionally large extents, exhibit properties similar to other classical halos: their radial profiles are described by a single-component exponential fit, they show radial spectral index steepening, and have an average radio emissivity of about $10^{-42}\, \mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-3}\,Hz^{-1}}$. Our results demonstrate that radio halos can extend to the cluster periphery, without the transition to an observationally distinguishable different halo component in the outermost regions. Our findings highlight that careful subtraction of unrelated sources embedded in the halo is necessary to measure the radio surface brightness accurately, as incomplete subtraction can introduce an apparent secondary component in the peripheral regions.</description>

      <title>Field-Level Comparison and Robustness Analysis of Cosmological N-body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first field-level comparison of cosmological N-body simulations, considering various widely used codes: Abacus, CUBEP$^3$M, Enzo, Gadget, Gizmo, PKDGrav, and Ramses. Unlike previous comparisons focused on summary statistics, we conduct a comprehensive field-level analysis: evaluating statistical similarity, quantifying implications for cosmological parameter inference, and identifying the regimes in which simulations are consistent. We begin with a traditional comparison using the power spectrum, cross-correlation coefficient, and visual inspection of the matter field. We follow this with a statistical out-of-distribution (OOD) analysis to quantify distributional differences between simulations, revealing insights not captured by the traditional metrics. We then perform field-level simulation-based inference (SBI) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), training on one simulation and testing on others, including a full hydrodynamic simulation for comparison. We identify several causes of OOD behavior and biased inference, finding that resolution effects, such as those arising from adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), have a significant impact. Models trained on non-AMR simulations fail catastrophically when evaluated on AMR simulations, introducing larger biases than those from hydrodynamic effects. Differences in resolution, even when using the same N-body code, likewise lead to biased inference. We attribute these failures to a CNN's sensitivity to small-scale fluctuations, particularly in voids and filaments, and demonstrate that appropriate smoothing brings the simulations into statistical agreement. Our findings motivate the need for careful data filtering and the use of field-level OOD metrics, such as PQMass, to ensure robust inference.</description>

      <title>Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and compared it to the previously released dataset of Planck 2018 and the newer BAO data of DESI. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe when early-time data was used and favours a quintessence Universe when combinations of early-time and late-time data was considered. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models</description>

      <title>Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic constraints on dark photons are generally presented assuming they have Stueckelberg masses. These constraints are strengthened if instead the mass is due to the Higgs mechanism and the dark Higgs is light. First, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the origin of kinetic mixing $\epsilon$ and perturbativity, the strengthened constraints on $\epsilon$ cannot be arbitrarily relaxed by making the Higgs heavy. Second, we demonstrate a simple mechanism for generating dark photon dark matter after inflation, where fluctuations of a dark Higgs by stochastic misalignment can produce stable dark photons through $h\to A'A'$ decay. Third, we point out new lower bounds on $\epsilon$ in the case where the dark photon mediates thermal freeze-out of light dark matter by $s$-channel exchange, taking account of generic expectations for the size of $\epsilon$, and astrophysical upper bounds on the self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Addressing the core-cusp and diversity problem of dwarf and disk galaxies using cold collisionless DARKexp theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are observed to have linearly rising rotation curves, which indicate constant density cores in their centers. These do not arise naturally from dark matter only simulations, giving rise to the ``core-cusp'' problem. Hydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback can create cored profiles, but this solution requires some fine tuning. Additionally, there is a related ``diversity'' problem in which simulations cannot reproduce the large range in rotation curve shapes for galaxies of similar mass. Here we investigate, for the first time, whether a theoretical model based on statistical mechanics (DARKexp) can produce flat density cores with its single shape parameter. We find that these theoretical profiles are able to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range ~ 20-200 km/s by producing fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies covering this range. We additionally show that the projected stellar density distributions of ultrafaint dwarfs that show cores are also well fit, and that wave, or fuzzy dark matter is unable to fit the full range of SPARC galaxies. Thus, DARKexp appears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of rotation curves in these dark matter dominated galaxies with cold collisionless dark matter alone, i.e., without introducing baryonic feedback, or alternative nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Metastable Cosmic Strings and Gravitational Waves from Flavour Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings (MSCSs) are among the best-fitting explanations of the 2023 pulsar timing array (PTA) signal for gravitational waves at nanohertz frequencies. We propose the novel possibility that a network of MSCSs generating this signal originates from the multi-step spontaneous breaking of a gauged flavour symmetry. As a specific example, we construct a model of $SU(2)$ flavour symmetry in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification, where the $SU(2)$ acts exclusively on the first two generations of the matter 10-plet, such that it is ``right for leptons'' and allows for large lepton mixing. The model explains the mass hierarchies of the Standard Model fermions, and predicts the string scale of the MSCSs in a range compatible with the 2023 PTA signal. Cosmic inflation is associated with the latter step of (two-step) family symmetry breaking, and the phase transition ending inflation generates the cosmic string network.</description>

      <title>Beyond the first galaxies primordial black holes shine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of nine candidate galaxies at $z=17$ and $z=25$ discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is virtually impossible to reconcile with the predictions of the current galaxy formation model. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ residing in low-mass halos ($M_h \approx 10^{7} \, M_{\odot}$), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity, $\lambda_E \simeq 0.36$. These sources precede the first significant episodes of cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH emission becomes comparable to, or subdominant with respect to, the galactic emission. This PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV luminosity function (LF) from $z=25$ to $z=11$. If ultra-early sources are powered purely by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production mechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive stars, Pop III stars, or clusters), or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBHs as the only alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as isolated, large clusters ($\approx 10^7 \,M_{\odot}$) of massive ($m_\star =10^3 M_{\odot}$) Pop III stars are marginally viable, but require extreme and unlikely conditions that can be probed via UV and far-infrared (FIR) emission lines or gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade will provide unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles annihilating in the core of the Sun. For dark matter candidates with spin-dependent couplings to nuclei and that annihilate significantly to tau leptons or neutrinos, we find that the IceCube Upgrade will be capable of testing parameter space that is beyond the reach of existing direct detection experiments. After calculating the sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to dark matter annihilation in the Sun, we explore dark matter models that could be tested by this experiment, identifying two classes of scenarios as promising targets for such searches.</description>

      <title>Return of the Lepton Number: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production and the Revival of the Shi-Fuller Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism, revisiting its cosmological viability in light of recent results demonstrating that lepton-number asymmetries $L_\alpha \gtrsim 1$ at temperatures $T &gt; 20\rm\,MeV$ are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasi-classical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the non-thermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both X-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future X-ray observations targeting the $\sim 20$ keV photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.</description>

      <title>Impact of Non-Thermal Leptogenesis with Early Matter Domination on Gravitational Waves from First-order Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and dynamics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>
