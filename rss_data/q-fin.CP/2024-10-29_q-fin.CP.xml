      <title>Extracting Alpha from Financial Analyst Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of a momentum trading signal based on the coverage network of financial analysts. This signal builds on the key information-brokerage role financial sell-side analysts play in modern stock markets. The baskets of stocks covered by each analyst can be used to construct a network between firms whose edge weights represent the number of analysts jointly covering both firms. Although the link between financial analysts coverage and co-movement of firms' stock prices has been investigated in the literature, little effort has been made to systematically learn the most effective combination of signals from firms covered jointly by analysts in order to benefit from any spillover effect. To fill this gap, we build a trading strategy which leverages the analyst coverage network using a graph attention network. More specifically, our model learns to aggregate information from individual firm features and signals from neighbouring firms in a node-level forecasting task. We develop a portfolio based on those predictions which we demonstrate to exhibit an annualized returns of 29.44% and a Sharpe ratio of 4.06 substantially outperforming market baselines and existing graph machine learning based frameworks. We further investigate the performance and robustness of this strategy through extensive empirical analysis. Our paper represents one of the first attempts in using graph machine learning to extract actionable knowledge from the analyst coverage network for practical financial applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Replication of the Prepayment Option of Mortgages including Behavioral Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prepayment risk embedded in fixed-rate mortgages forms a significant fraction of a financial institution's exposure, and it receives particular attention because of the magnitude of the underlying market. The embedded prepayment option (EPO) bears the same interest rate risk as an exotic interest rate swap (IRS) with a suitable stochastic notional. We investigate the effect of relaxing the assumption of a deterministic relationship between the market interest rate incentive and the prepayment rate. A non-hedgeable risk factor is modeled to capture the uncertainty in mortgage owners' behavior, leading to an incomplete market. We prove under natural assumptions that including behavioral uncertainty reduces the exposure's value. We statically replicate the exposure resulting from the EPO with IRSs and swaptions, and we show that a replication based on swaps solely cannot easily control the right tail of the exposure distribution, while including swaptions enables that. The replication framework is flexible and focuses on different regions in the exposure distribution. Since a non-hedgeable risk factor entails the existence of multiple equivalent martingale measures, pricing and optimal replication are not unique. We investigate the effect of a market price of risk misspecification and we provide a methodology to generate robust hedging strategies. Such strategies, obtained as solutions to a saddle-point problem, allow us to bound the exposure against a misspecification of the pricing measure.</description>

      <title>MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Approach for the Pricing of Debt Securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for the pricing of debt securities under general time-inhomogeneous short-rate diffusion processes. The pricing of bonds, bond options, callable/putable bonds, and convertible bonds (CBs) are covered. Using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximation, we obtain closed-form matrix expressions to approximate the price of bonds and bond options under general one-dimensional short-rate processes. A simple and efficient algorithm is also developed to price callable/putable debts. The availability of a closed-form expression for the price of zero-coupon bonds allows for the perfect fit of the approximated model to the current market term structure of interest rates, regardless of the complexity of the underlying diffusion process selected. We further consider the pricing of CBs under general bi-dimensional time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes to model equity and short-rate dynamics. Credit risk is also incorporated into the model using the approach of Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998). Based on a two-layer CTMC method, an efficient algorithm is developed to approximate the price of convertible bonds. When conversion is only allowed at maturity, a closed-form matrix expression is obtained. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method across a wide range of model parameters and short-rate models.</description>

      <title>A path-dependent PDE solver based on signature kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a provably convergent kernel-based solver for path-dependent PDEs (PPDEs). Our numerical scheme leverages signature kernels, a recently introduced class of kernels on path-space. Specifically, we solve an optimal recovery problem by approximating the solution of a PPDE with an element of minimal norm in the signature reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) constrained to satisfy the PPDE at a finite collection of collocation paths. In the linear case, we show that the optimisation has a unique closed-form solution expressed in terms of signature kernel evaluations at the collocation paths. We prove consistency of the proposed scheme, guaranteeing convergence to the PPDE solution as the number of collocation points increases. Finally, several numerical examples are presented, in particular in the context of option pricing under rough volatility. Our numerical scheme constitutes a valid alternative to the ubiquitous Monte Carlo methods.</description>
