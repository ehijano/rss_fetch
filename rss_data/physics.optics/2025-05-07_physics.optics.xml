      <title>Enhanced timing of a 113 km O-TWTFT link with digital maximum likelihood estimation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical two-way time-frequency transfer (O-TWTFT), employing linear optical sampling and based on frequency combs, is a promising approach for future large-scale optical clock synchronization. It offers the dual benefits of high temporal resolution and an extensive unambiguous range. A critical challenge in establishing long-distance free-space optical links is enhancing detection sensitivity. Particularly at ultra-low received power levels, the error caused by time extraction algorithms for linear optical sampling becomes a significant hindrance to system sensitivity, surpassing the constraints imposed by quantum limitations. In this work, we introduce the Complex Least Squares (CLS) method to enhance both the accuracy and sensitivity of time extraction. Unlike most previous methods that relied solely on phase information, our scheme utilizes a maximum likelihood estimation technique incorporating both amplitude and phase data. Our experiments, conducted over a 113 km free-space link with an average link loss of up to 100 dB, achieved a record minimum received power of 0.1 nW, which is over ten times lower than previous benchmarks. The precision also approaches the quantum limitation.</description>

      <title>Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Efficient and tunable frequency conversion using periodically poled thin-film lithium tantalate nanowaveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT) has recently emerged as a promising photonic platform for chip-scale nonlinear optics due to its weaker photorefraction, higher optical damage threshold, broader transparency window, and lower birefringence compared to that of thin-film lithium niobate. Here we develop an ultralow-loss lithium tantalate integrated photonic platform and report the first functional second harmonic generator based on high-fidelity poling of z-cut TFLT. As a result, quasi-phase matching (QPM) is performed between telecom (1550 nm) and near-visible (775 nm) wavelengths in a straight waveguide and prompts strong second-harmonic generation with a normalized efficiency of 229 %/W/$cm^2$. An absolute conversion efficiency of 5.5 % is achieved with a pump power of 700 mW. Such a second-harmonic generator exhibits stable temperature tunability (-0.44 nm/$^\circ C$) which is important for applications that require precise frequency alignment such as atomic clocks and quantum frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Rapid diagnostics of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces using space-time-coding modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key technology for shaping smart wireless environments in next-generation wireless communication systems. To support the large-scale deployment of RISs, a reliable and efficient diagnostic method is essential to ensure optimal performance. In this work, a robust and efficient approach for RIS diagnostics is proposed using a space-time coding strategy with orthogonal codes. The method encodes the reflected signals from individual RIS elements into distinct code channels, enabling the recovery of channel power at the receiving terminals for fault identification. Theoretical analysis shows that the normally functioning elements generate high power in their respective code channels, whereas the faulty elements exhibit significantly lower power. This distinction enables rapid and accurate diagnostics of elements' operational states through simple signal processing techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, even under high fault ratios and varying reception angles. Proof-of-principle experiments on two RIS prototypes are conducted, implementing two coding strategies: direct and segmented. Experimental results in a realistic scenario confirm the reliability of the diagnostic method, demonstrating its potential for large-scale RIS deployment in future wireless communication systems and radar applications.</description>

      <title>Tailoring ultra-high-order optical skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, as quasiparticles with topological spin textures, has recently garnered great attention for both condensed matter and structured wave communities, promising next-generation large-density robust information technologies. However, a big challenge to this end is that the generation of high-order skyrmions is elusive in any physical systems. Here, we propose the method to create and control ultra-high-order skyrmions (skyrmion number up to $400^{th}$) in a structured light system. We also experimentally control the topological state transition between bimeron and skyrmion, arbitrarily tailor the transverse size of an arbitrary-order skyrmionic beam independent of topological number, and ensure the topological stability upon propagation. Our work offers solutions for topologically resilient communication and memory with much enhanced information capacity.</description>

      <title>Dual-mode phonon dynamics and lasing in optomechanical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the full nonlinear bifurcation theory as a powerful methodology to thoroughly classify and predict the phonon lasing dynamics in optomechanical cavities. We exemplify its scope in the very relevant and so far vaguely explored dynamics of dual-mode phonon lasing when two independent mechanical modes are directly coupled to one optical field. We uncover a plethora of different lasing regimes in a fixed and realistic cavity geometry, including single- and dual-mode lasing, perfect synchronization of different mechanical modes, and quasiperiodic time crystals. All dynamical regimes are unambiguously associated with bifurcations of different natures, which may exhibit both super and sub-critical natures characterizing the often hysteretic behavior of the systems when they are externally driven by a time-varying laser source. Our results, generalizable to any other optomechanical system, open unprecedented pathways to understand and control the formation and dynamics of optomechanical frequency combs.</description>

      <title>Janus bound states in the continuum in structurally symmetric photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sigma_z-symmetry-preserving approach to achieve Janus bound states in the continuum (Janus BICs) exhibiting asymmetric topological charges in the upward and downward radiation channels. While prior approaches typically involve explicit structural perturbations to break vertical symmetry, our design leverages a bilayer photonic crystal slab (PCS) system with independently tunable refractive indices, introducing an optical asymmetry without altering the geometric symmetry. In the optical symmetry case, the system supports symmetry-protected BICs at Gamma point with topological charge q = -1, and Friedrich-Wintgen BICs (FW-BICs) at off-Gamma point with q = +1. Upon introducing refractive index detuning, the polarization vortex splits into two circularly polarized states (C points) with half-integer topological charge (q = 1/2), shifting oppositely in momentum space for upward and downward radiation, while the symmetry-protected BICs remain unaffected. Janus BICs are established through the shift of upward-radiating C points shift towards the Gamma point, accumulating a total topological charge of q = -1, while the downward-radiating counterpart contributes q = +1, leading to a net topological charge reversal between the two radiation channels. This purely optical mechanism allows for the realization of Janus BICs without any structural deformation. Their asymmetric topological nature makes them ideally suited for applications in unidirectional light sources, chiral photonic interfaces, and topological photonic circuits, offering a promising platform for on-chip optical communication, sensing, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable NbOCl$_2$ Metasurface for Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon-pair sources are foundational to advancing quantum technologies, including secure communication, quantum sensing, and imaging. For deployment in space-constrained environments such as satellite-based quantum networks or portable devices, compact, reconfigurable, and efficient entanglement sources are essential. Here, we present an electrically tunable entangled photon-pair source utilizing a nanostructured NbOCl$_2$ crystal, engineered for operation in the telecommunication C-band. The inherent non-centrosymmetric lattice symmetry of NbOCl$_2$ enables direct generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without the need for post-selection, leveraging its exceptional second-order nonlinear susceptibility, which surpasses conventional nonlinear materials. By nanopatterning NbOCl$_2$ into a high-quality-factor metasurface, we achieve three orders of magnitude enhancement in photon-pair generation efficiency via resonant excitation of bound states in the continuum resonance, which intensify light-matter interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate in situ electrical tunability of the photon-pair emission wavelength over a 250 nm range from 1450 nm to 1700 nm by dynamically modulating surrounding liquid crystal layer. Remarkably, the decoupling of photon-pair generation rate and spectral tunability ensures high brightness, above 10,000 coincidences, under active tuning. The air stability and mechanical robustness of NbOCl$_2$ further enhance its practicality for real-world deployment. This work establishes NbOCl$_2$ as a superior material for scalable, on-chip quantum light sources, paving the way for integrated quantum communication systems, adaptive sensors, and portable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerated inverse design of passive Si Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an accurate differentiable parametrization scheme for topological optimization and inverse design of passive components of integrated Si photonics. We show that the most of operations in the transformation chain from control variables to effective anisotropic dielectric tensor discretized on the Yee grid are expressible in terms of generalized convolutions that can be computed efficiently on GPU accelerators. Combined with the recent open-source GPU FDTD code and custom gradient-descent optimizer with dynamic control of final design manufacturability, it results in fast inverse design tool capable of producing reliable Si photonic component layouts in minutes/hours instead of days. The final designs, although not globally optimal, are generally physically meaningful since they reflect how fields themselves tend to propagate through the device in the most efficient way.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Electromagnetic and Nanophotonic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with physics-guided frameworks has opened transformative avenues for advancing the design and optimization of electromagnetic and nanophotonic systems. Innovations in deep neural networks (DNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) now provide robust tools to tackle longstanding challenges in light scattering engineering, meta-optics, and nonlinear photonics. This review outlines recent progress in leveraging these computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains such as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical phenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and inverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches by embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore, the integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables precise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic states and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic frameworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency, multi-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as limited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional optical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future opportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and practical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices. This work underscores the pivotal role of AI in transcending traditional design limitations, thereby propelling the development of next-generation photonic technologies with unprecedented functionality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Fabrication-tolerant frequency conversion in thin film lithium niobate waveguide with layer-poled modal phase matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to its high quadratic nonlinear susceptibilty and low propagation losses, thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator is an ideal platform for laser frequency conversion and generation of quantum states of light. Frequency conversion is usually achieved by quasi-phase matching (QPM) via electric-field poling. However, this scheme shows very high sensitivity to the dimensions of the waveguide, poling period and duty cycle, resulting in a lack of repeatability of the phase matched wavelength and efficiency, which in turn limits the spread of TFLN frequency converters in complex circuits and hinders wafer-scale production. Here we propose a layer-poled modal phase matching (MPM) that is 5 to 10 times more robust towards fabrication uncertainties and theoretically more efficient than conventional QPM. By selectively poling the bottom part of the waveguide all along its length, second harmonic is efficiently generated on a higher order waveguide's mode. We validate this approach by poling TFLN waveguides as a post-process after the fabrication in a foundry process. We perform a tolerance analysis and compare the experimental results with conventional QPM second harmonic generation process on the same waveguides. Then, we show how MPM can be exploited to obtain efficient intraband frequency conversion processes at telecom wavelengths by leveraging simultaneous second harmonic and difference frequency generation in the same waveguide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabry-Perot cavities are widely used in current gravitational-wave detectors. In particular, they play a key role in frequency-dependent squeezing systems, enabling broadband quantum noise reduction. However, their ability to precisely control squeezing properties may be insufficient for the next generation of detectors. In this context, theoretical studies on linear three-mirror cavities have revealed promising features, such as resonance peak splitting and their equivalence to two-mirror cavities with variable finesse. In this paper, we report experimental observations of both the resonant doublet and variable finesse using a meter-scale implementation of a linear three-mirror cavity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) thin films facilitate strong light-matter interactions with a widespread impact in nonlinear, quantum and thermal photonics. Here, we extend the scope of thin film ENZ modes by elucidating the generalized polaritonic modes emerging from anisotropy and near-zero permittivity. Through a theoretical investigation of generalized ENZ polaritons on silicon carbide (SiC) metasurfaces, we reveal a complex polaritonic landscape, consisting of a seven-region phase diagram. We show that the complex interplay between material properties and geometry changes the nature of the modes, and we clarify when ENZ modes with closed and open isofrequency curves (IFCs) can be observed, and how they coexist with surface phonon-polaritons and hyperbolic modes. The associated photonic topological transitions are accompanied by phase velocity sign reversals and induce dramatic modifications of near-field profiles and Purcell enhancement factors. Our work merges insights from anisotropic and ENZ effects, enabling enhanced control over polariton behavior with broad implications for subwavelength optics, material design, nonlinear effects, thermal emission, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Resonant enhanced detection of the higher-order modes of a locked cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are limited in the amount of circulating power they can reach. Optical absorption in the test masses leads to thermal effects that shift the eigenmodes of the optical cavities, and cause control issues such as parametric instabilities.
  Here we experimentally validate a novel technique using optical injection to measure the mode amplitudes within an optical resonator. We use a phase camera, similar to the ones installed at gravitational-wave detectors, in transmission of the cavity, to confirm the mode basis and image modes up to order 10. We showcase as well the capability of the phase camera to determine the optical phase between the carrier fundamental mode and other co-resonating higher-order modes, which can be used for optical suppression of parametric instabilities and automatic mode matching.
  These results highlight the relevance of implementing a similar scheme in current GW detectors to monitor thermal effects.</description>

      <title>Full space-time abrupt autofocusing spherical Airy wavepacket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to precisely focus optical beams is crucial for numerous applications, yet conventional Gaussian beams exhibit slow intensity transitions near the focal point, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring sharp focusing. In this work, the spherical Airy wavepacket, a three dimensional light field with an Airy function distribution in the radial direction in the full space time domain, is introduced and experimentally demonstrated. Leveraging the recently developed spatiotemporal hologram technique and an exponential polar coordinate transformation, spherical Airy wavepacket is sculpted to exhibit ultrafast autofocusing with a dramatically reduced depth of focus compared to conventional Gaussian beams and circular Airy beams. Experimental measurements confirm its nonlinear intensity surge and tight spatiotemporal confinement.</description>

      <title>Distance dependent interaction between a single emitter and a single dielectric nanoparticle using DNA origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical nanoantennas can manipulate light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, modifying the emission properties of nearby single photon emitters. To date, most optical antennas are based on metallic nanostructures that exhibit unmatched performance in terms of electric field enhancement but suffer from substantial ohmic losses that limit their applications. To circumvent these limitations, there is a growing interest in alternative materials. In particular, high-refractive-index dielectrics have emerged as promising candidates, offering negligible ohmic losses, and supporting both electric and magnetic resonances in the visible and near-infrared range that can unlock novel effects. Currently, the few available studies on dielectric nanoantennas focus on ensemble measurements. Here, we exploit the DNA origami technique to study the interaction between silicon nanoparticles and organic fluorophores at the single molecule level, in controlled geometries and at different spectral ranges within the visible spectrum. We characterize their distance-dependent interaction in terms of fluorescence intensity and lifetime, revealing a significant modification of the decay rate together with minimal quenching and a high fluorescence quantum yield even at short distances from the dielectric nanoparticle. This work demonstrates the advantages of dielectric nanoantennas over their metallic counterparts and paves the way for their applications in single-molecule spectroscopy and sensing.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter commonly feature protected states at their boundaries. Transferring this protection to time-metamaterials is extremely challenging, as it requires the generation of an abrupt interface between two topologically distinct bulks. Here, we realize and measure an ultrafast topological non-Hermitian skin mode bound to an interface circulating within the cavity of a fast-gain semiconductor laser. The nonlinear stationary state generated in such devices features a jump in the instantaneous frequency. We show that this discontinuity gives rise to a topological interface for the field fluctuations in the system. Using direct intensity sampling, we experimentally measure the skin modes and their positioning at the frequency jump of the stationary state. Analysis of these isolated modes reveals an ultrashort full-width at half-maximum of 583 $\pm$ 16 fs. Furthermore, we show that we can tune the shape and relative timing shift of the skin modes via external bias modulation. Finally, both numerical and experimental analysis of the noise in the system reveal that field fluctuations are funneled into the topological interface. Our findings reveal a new way to generate topologically protected states of light in time, which paves the way for novel time-varying physics as well as metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Highly squeezed nanophotonic quantum microcombs with broadband frequency tunability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light offers genuine quantum advantage in enhanced sensing and quantum computation; yet the level of squeezing or quantum noise reduction generated from nanophotonic chips has been limited. In addition to strong quantum noise reduction, key desiderata for such a nanophotonic squeezer include frequency agility or tunability over a broad frequency range, and simultaneous operation in many distinct, well-defined quantum modes (qumodes). Here we present a strongly overcoupled silicon nitride squeezer based on a below-threshold optical parametric amplifier (OPA) that produces directly detected squeezing of 5.6 dB $\pm$ 0.2 dB, surpassing previous demonstrations in both continuous-wave and pulsed regimes. We introduce a seed-assisted detection technique into such nanophotonic squeezers that reveals a quantum frequency comb (QFC) of 16 qumodes, with a separation of 11~THz between the furthest qumode pair, while maintaining a strong squeezing. Additionally, we report spectral tuning of a qumode comb pair over one free-spectral range of the OPA, thus bridging the spacing between the discrete modes of the QFC. Our results significantly advance both the generation and detection of nanophotonic squeezed light in a broadband and multimode platform, establishing a scalable, chip-integrated path for compact quantum sensors and continuous-variable quantum information processing systems.</description>

      <title>Entangled-photon time- and frequency-resolved optical spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical time-resolved optical spectroscopy experiments are performed using sequences of ultrashort light pulses, with photon fluxes incident on the sample which are many orders of magnitude higher than real-world conditions corresponding to sunlight illumination. Here we overcome this paradigm by exploiting quantum correlations to perform time-resolved spectroscopy with entangled photons. Starting from spontaneous parametric down-conversion driven by a continuous-wave laser, we exploit the temporal entanglement between randomly generated signal/idler pairs to obtain temporal resolution, and their spectral entanglement to select the excitation frequency. We also add spectral resolution in detection, using a Fourier transform approach which employs a common-path interferometer. We demonstrate the potential of our entangled-photon streak camera by resolving, at the single-photon level, excitation energy transfer cascades from LH2 to LH1 in the photosynthetic membrane and disentangling the lifetimes of two dyes in a mixture. We show that time-resolved spectroscopy with quantum light can be performed without compromising measurement time, recording a fluorescence time trace in less than a minute even for samples with low quantum yield, which can be reduced to sub-second times with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Our results provide a new approach to ultrafast optical spectroscopy, where experiments are performed under conditions comparable to real-world sunlight illumination.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Framework for Wide-Field Small Aperture Telescope Arrays Used in Sky Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For time-domain astronomy, it is crucial to frequently image celestial objects at specific depths within a predetermined cadence. To fulfill these scientific demands, scientists globally have started or planned the development of non-interferometric telescope arrays in recent years. Due to the numerous parameters involved in configuring these arrays, there is a need for an automated optimization framework that selects parameter sets to satisfy scientific needs while minimizing costs. In this paper, we introduce such a framework, which integrates optical design software, an exposure time calculator, and an optimization algorithm, to balance the observation capabilities and the cost of optical telescope arrays. Neural networks are utilized to speed up results retrieval of the system with different configurations. We use the SiTian project as a case study to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing that this approach can aid scientists in selecting optimal parameter sets. The code for this framework is published in the China Virtual Observatory PaperData Repository, enabling users to optimize parameters for various non-interferometric telescope array projects.</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified Josephson plasma waves in YBa_2Cu_3O_(6+x): evidence for local superconducting fluctuations up to the pseudogap temperature $T^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of experiments have reported evidence for the existence of the lower Josephson plasmon mode in underdoped YBCO up to the pseudogap temperature scale when the sample is subject to intense terahertz pulses. Evidences include the observation of a reflectivity edge that resembles that of the superconducting state, and the second harmonic generation of a probe optical pulse that is modulated at a frequency similar the reflectivity feature. Since the lower Josephson plasmon mode is often associated with coherent oscillations between bilayers in the YBCO structure, these experiments have led to the suggestion that the intense pump has created pair coherence up to 350K. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation of these experiments based on the model of short ranged superconducting correlations in the equilibrium state and using the Floquet perspective to analyze optical responses of the photoexcited state. Our model only requires local pairing with phase correlations that can be very short ranged when the system is at equilibrium at a temperature above Tc but below the pseudo-gap temperature T*. Within this assumption there is no phase coherence between bilayers. On the other hand the relative phase between members of the bilayer has a longer in-plane correlation which leads locally to a finite Josephson current. We show that the nonlinearity afforded by the local intra-bilayer Josephson current is sufficient to explain both the reflectivity and second harmonic generation data. The key point is that in the lower Josephson plasmon, the coupling between bilayers is mainly capacitive: the Josepson current between bilayers can be set to zero without affecting the parametric amplification process. The implication is that while superconducting coherence may not be created by the pump, the pseudogap phase must possess a local pairing amplitude at equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of the thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3) platform has established it as a premier choice for high-performance photonics integrated circuits. However, the scalability and cost-efficiency of this platform are hindered by the reliance on chip-level fabrication and integration for passive and active components, necessitating a robust wafer-level LiNbO3 heterogeneous integration platform. Despite its critical role in enabling ultrahigh-speed optical interconnects, as well as optical mmWave/THz sensing and communication, the realization of ultrahigh-speed photodiodes and optical coherent receivers on the LiNbO_3 platform remains an unresolved challenge. This is primarily due to the challenges associated with the large-scale integration of direct-bandgap materials. To address these challenges, we have developed a scalable, high-speed InP-LiNbO3 wafer-level heterogeneous integration platform. This platform facilitates the fabrication of ultrahigh-speed photodiodes with a bandwidth of 140 GHz, capable of receiving high-quality 100-Gbaud pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) signals. Moreover, we demonstrate a seven-channel, single-polarization I-Q coherent receiver chip with an aggregate receiving capacity of 3.584 Tbit/s. This coherent receiver exhibits a balanced detection bandwidth of 60 GHz and a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) exceeding 20 dB. It achieves receiving capacities of 600 Gbit/s/\lambda with a 100-Gbaud 64-QAM signal and 512 Gbit/s/\lambda with a 128-Gbaud 16-QAM signal. Furthermore, energy consumption as low as 9.6 fJ/bit and 13.5 fJ/bit is achieved for 200 Gbit/s and 400 Gbit/s capacities, respectively. Our work provides a viable pathway toward enabling Pbps hyperscale data center interconnects, as well as optical mmWave/THz sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Fano resonance in XUV generated by helium with few-cycle intense laser pulses and its classical analogy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We integrate numerically the Schr\"odinger equation for the model helium atom irradiated by intense few-cycle laser pulse and find the emitted XUV spectra. They demonstrate resonant peaks at the frequencies of transitions from the doubly-excited autoionizing states (AISs) to the ground state. We study the properties of these peaks depending on the laser pulse duration and find that the decay of the AISs due to photoionization by the laser field affects them. Moreover, we consider the classical system of two coupled oscillators and find that both the quantum (the atom with AIS in the field) and the classical (the coupled oscillators with friction) systems demonstrate Fano-like resonant peak described by an essentially complex asymmetry parameter. We find a remarkable similarity in the behavior of these systems and conclude that the classical system of coupled oscillators with friction is an analogy of the AIS having an extra decay channel in addition to the autoionization one.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field induced control and Multiple Magnomechanically Induced Transparency in Single Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) in a microwave 3D copper cavity with two YIG spheres under varying interaction parameters. Numerical simulations show that the steady-state magnon number increases with stronger coupling between cavity photons and magnons, and is sensitive to both bias and drive magnetic fields. Pronounced peaks in the magnon population near resonant fields highlight the importance of the bias field in energy transfer. The transparency windows are tunable, with up to quadruple windows depending on the coupling and magnon-phonon interactions, as seen in the transmission spectrum. Dispersion analysis reveals normal and anomalous regions, enabling slow and fast light propagation modulated by coupling strength. Phase and group delay variations, influenced by the drive field, further validate the tunability of transparency windows. This study demonstrates the potential of MMIT for precise control with out any additional non-linearity over light-matter interactions, with applications in quantum information processing and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Streaming Self-Corrected Dual-Comb Spectrometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We radically simplify coherently averaged dual-comb spectroscopy by introducing a real-time self-correction system: a radio frequency system-on-chip computes each incoming dual-comb interferogram's phase, frequency, and arrival time; calculates changes in the combs' carrier-envelope offset frequency and repetition rate difference; and immediately phase-corrects the incoming interferogram data stream. The algorithm supports up to 0.3 GHz interferogram frequency bandwidth and thus combines fast measurement times (corresponding to high detunings) with broadband optical detection. Using this system, we achieve comb-resolved spectroscopy with Fourier-limited linewidth, coherent averaging over arbitrarily long durations, and high signal-to-noise ratios (e.g., up to 2900 for 150 s averaging time). Iodine and acetylene spectroscopy yield excellent agreement with literature over an optical bandwidth of 10 THz in the visible and near-infrared. Common dual-comb spectroscopy self-correction requires a bright and continuous interferogram train. We lift this requirement by introducing cross-channel correction: the algorithm measures phase fluctuations from a reference channel and predicts and corrects their influence on a signal channel. This enables correcting unstable or intermittent signals (typical, e.g., in field measurements), or low-amplitude signals with amplified phase fluctuations (relevant for nonlinearly upconverted combs). The approach makes instantaneous dual-comb spectroscopy available to everyday applications.</description>

      <title>Roughness-Limited Performance in Ultra-Low-Loss Lithium Niobate Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving low optical loss is critical for scaling complex photonic systems. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) offers strong electro-optic and nonlinear properties in a compact platform, making it ideal for quantum and nonlinear optics. While $Q$ factors above $10^7$ have been achieved, they remain below the intrinsic material limit. We present a systematic study of scattering losses due to roughness in TFLN racetrack cavities, isolating contributions from sidewall and interface roughness. Quality factors up to $27 \times 10^6$ are demonstrated in waveguides with widths of $2.2\lambda$ ($\sim3.5\,\mu$m), where interface roughness dominates, and up to $1.2 \times 10^7$ in narrower waveguides $0.8\lambda$ wide ($\sim1.2\,\mu$m), where sidewall roughness is the primary limitation. Our modeling framework, based on 3D wave simulations informed by AFM-measured roughness, is material-independent and broadly applicable across integrated photonic platforms.</description>

Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework for enhancing or enabling cooling of a mechanical resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes interaction and zero-photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive $p-n$ junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.</description>

      <title>Squeezing at the normal-mode splitting frequency of a nonlinear coupled cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled optical cavities, which support normal modes, play a critical role in optical filtering, sensing, slow-light generation, and quantum state manipulation. Recent theoretical work has proposed incorporating nonlinear materials into these systems to enable novel quantum technologies. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of squeezing generated in a quantum-enhanced coupled-cavity system, achieving a quantum noise reduction of 3.3 dB around the normal-mode splitting frequency of 7.47 MHz. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's loss mechanisms and performance limitations, validating theoretical predictions. Our results underscore the promise of coupled-cavity squeezers for advanced quantum applications, including gravitational wave detection and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Damped photonic modes in helical graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helical spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helical graphene structures. We model the helical graphene surface as a smooth, continuous, and distortion-free manifold, effectively adopting the continuum approximation. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helical background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helical pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helical graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Robust entangled photon generation enabled by single-shot Floquet driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast single-shot Floquet driving. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Fidelity and efficiency analysis for heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels: linear and nonlinear optical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.</description>
