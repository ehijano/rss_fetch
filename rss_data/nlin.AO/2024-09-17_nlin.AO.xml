      <title>Expected and unexpected routes to synchronization in a system of swarmalators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of oscillators whose internal phases and spatial dynamics are coupled, swarmalators, present diverse collective behaviors which in some cases lead to explosive synchronization in a finite population as a function of the coupling parameter between internal phases. Near the synchronization transition, the phase energy of the particles is represented by the XY model, and they undergo a transition which can be of the first order or second depending on the distribution of natural frequencies of their internal dynamics. The first order transition is obtained after an intermediate state (Static Wings Phase Wave state (SWPW)) from which the nodes, in cascade over time, achieve complete phase synchronization at a precise value of the coupling constant. For a particular case of natural frequencies distribution, a new phenomenon of Rotational Splintered Phase Wave state (RSpPW) is observed and leads progressively to synchronization through clusters switching alternatively from one to two and for which the frequency decreases as the phase coupling increases.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of opinion dynamics with complex interaction types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence rate is a crucial issue in opinion dynamics, which characterizes how quickly opinions reach a consensus and tells when the collective behavior can be formed. However, the key factors that determine the convergence rate of opinions are elusive, especially when individuals interact with complex interaction types such as friend/foe, ally/adversary, or trust/mistrust. In this paper, using random matrix theory and low-rank perturbation theory, we present a new body of theory to comprehensively study the convergence rate of opinion dynamics. First, we divide the complex interaction types into five typical scenarios: mutual trust $(+/+)$, mutual mistrust $(-/-)$, trust$/$mistrust $(+/-)$, unilateral trust $(+/0)$, and unilateral mistrust $(-/0)$. For diverse interaction types, we derive the mathematical expression of the convergence rate, and further establish the direct connection between the convergence rate and population size, the density of interactions (network connectivity), and individuals' self-confidence level. Second, taking advantage of these connections, we prove that for the $(+/+)$, $(+/-)$, $(+/0)$, and random mixture of different interaction types, the convergence rate is proportional to the population size and network connectivity, while it is inversely proportional to the individuals' self-confidence level. However, for the $(-/-)$ and $(-/0)$ scenarios, we draw the exact opposite conclusions. Third, for the $(+/+,-/-)$ and $(-/-,-/0)$ scenarios, we derive the optimal proportion of different interaction types to ensure the fast convergence of opinions. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>How Combined Pairwise and Higher-Order Interactions Shape Transient Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how species interactions shape biodiversity is a core challenge in ecology. While much focus has been on long-term stability, there is rising interest in transient dynamics-the short-lived periods when ecosystems respond to disturbances and adjust toward stability. These transitions are crucial for predicting ecosystem reactions and guiding effective conservation. Our study introduces a model that blends pairwise and higher-order interactions, offering a more realistic view of natural ecosystems. We find pairwise interactions slow the journey to stability, while higher-order interactions speed it up. This model provides fresh insights into ecosystem resilience and recovery, helping improve strategies for managing species and ecological disruptions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Signal and Noise: Unraveling Scale Invariance in Neuroscience and Financial Networks with Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is increasingly crucial in investigating the shape of complex data structures across scientific fields, particularly in neuroscience and finance. This study delves into persistent homology, a TDA component initially aimed at differentiating between signal and noise. We explore two methodologies: the conventional cycle length approach and the novel death-birth ratio method proposed by Bobrowski and Skraba. Analyzing rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and daily $S\&amp;P 500$ financial networks, our study compares these methods in identifying significant cycles. A key discovery is a robust relationship between z-score thresholds applied to bar lengths or ratios and behavioural traits in brain networks and market volatility in financial networks. In the brain, this is evident in the strong correlation between significant 1-cycles, brain volumes, and sex-based differences. In financial markets, a fractal pattern emerges, where market volatility negatively correlates with the number of significant cycles, indicating that more complex market topologies are associated with increased stability. Our findings also imply a fractal nature of 1-cycles at both population levels and across multiple days in the stock market. The distribution of significant loops, marked by high z-scores, remains consistent across various z-score thresholds, revealing a scale-invariant, fractal structure in both data sets. Given the scale invariance in these fractal structures, the traditional TDA distinction between signal and noise becomes less meaningful. This suggests that all scales of cycle length are relevant, challenging the conventional approach of segregating signal from noise and broadening the scope of TDA to reveal intricate, scale-invariant relationships in complex systems.</description>
