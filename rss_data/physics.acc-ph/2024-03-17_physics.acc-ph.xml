      <title>Fast Tracking of 6D Particle Phase Space Using the FC2CT Algorithm for rf Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a fast cell to cell tracking algorithm (FC2CT) is developed, that determines the change in 6D phase space of a particle beam through rf accelerating cavities operated in both Standing and Traveling Wave modes. The performance is compared to well trusted tracking codes - ASTRA and RF-Track - for proton beams with relativistic beta = 0.5. The FC2CT algorithm produces a complete analytical method to determine the change in particle momentum, with the constant particle velocity approximation over the integration region. Additional developments for FC2CT are discussed, such as altering the integration length. FC2CT can be used as a fast method class in common tracking codes to perform fast simulations through rf cavities.</description>

      <title>Beam Dynamics Framework Incorporating Acceleration to Define the Minimum Aperture in Two Focusing Schemes for Proton Radiotherapy Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a self-consistent transverse beam dynamics framework is demonstrated, that incorporates acceleration into the transverse beam dynamics studies for a proton linac machine. Two focusing schemes are developed and discussed; the FODO-like scheme, and the minimum aperture scheme. The FODO-like scheme is a simple scheme, requiring only one quadrupole per cavity. The scheme is analytically solved to minimise the beam size at the cavity entrance/exit and ensures a constant beam size along the lattice, with respect to adiabatic damping due to longitudinally accelerating rf cavities. The minimum aperture scheme describes the regime that matches the beam ellipse to the acceptance ellipse of a cavity, allowing for the smallest possible aperture, for a given cavity length. A simple approximation of an rf cavity map is determined to allow changes in particle energy along a lattice, and acceleration is assumed only in the longitudinal direction.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks as Effective Surrogate Models of Radio-Frequency Quadrupole Particle Accelerator Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio-Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQs) are multi-purpose linear particle accelerators that simultaneously bunch and accelerate charged particle beams. They are ubiquitous in accelerator physics, especially as injectors to higher-energy machines, owing to their impressive efficiency. The design and optimization of these devices can be lengthy due to the need to repeatedly perform high-fidelity simulations. Several recent papers have demonstrated that machine learning can be used to build surrogate models (fast-executing replacements of computationally costly beam simulations) for order-of-magnitude computing time speedups. However, while these pilot studies are encouraging, there is room to improve their predictive accuracy. Particularly, beam summary statistics such as emittances (an important figure of merit in particle accelerator physics) have historically been challenging to predict. For the first time, we present a surrogate model trained on 200,000 samples that yields &lt;6% mean average percent error for the predictions of all relevant beam output parameters, solving the problem of poor emittance predictions by identifying and including hidden variables which were not accounted for previously. These surrogate models were made possible by using the Julia language and GPU computing; we briefly discuss both. We demonstrate the utility of surrogate modeling by performing a multi-objective optimization using our best model as a callback in the objective function to select an optimal RFQ design. We consider trade-offs in RFQ performance for various choices of Pareto-optimal design variables: common issues for any multi-objective optimization scheme. Lastly, we make recommendations for input data preparation, selection, and neural network architectures that pave the way for future development of production-capable surrogate models for RFQs and other particle accelerators.</description>
