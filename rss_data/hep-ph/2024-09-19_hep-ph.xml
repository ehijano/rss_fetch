      <title>Phase Separation Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinct behavior of decaying particles in true and false vacua of the theory can lead to enhanced generation of baryon asymmetry, a scenario we call \textit{phase separation baryogenesis}. We demonstrate that for leptogenesis this naturally allows for right handed neutrinos to generate resonantly-enhanced lepton asymmetry without fine-tuning of their masses as in typical theories. Our mechanism allows for a variety of neutrino mass hierarchies and hence possible novel connections with observations. We present a concrete realization in a minimal model with a scalar field undergoing a phase transition.</description>

      <title>$\nu$-point energy correletors with FastEEC: small-$x$ physics from LHC jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\nu$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\nu \to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\nu$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\nu$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\nu$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\nu$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\nu$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\nu$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension. This work is meant as a first step towards detailed experimental measurements and precision theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Towards an unbiased jet energy loss measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modifications imprinted on jets due to their interaction with Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are assessed by comparing samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The standard procedure ignores the effect of bin migration by comparing specific observables for jet populations at the same reconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). Since jet $p_T$ is itself modified by interaction with QGP, all such comparisons confound QGP induced modifications with changes that are simply a consequence of comparing jets that started out differently. The quantile matching procedure introduced by Brewer et al. directly estimates average fractional jet energy loss ($Q_{AA}$) and can thus mitigate this $p_T$ migration effect. In this work, we validate the procedure in more realistic scenarios that include medium response. We study the evolution of $Q_{AA}$ with jet radius, its sensitivity to minimum particle $p_T$ and medium response as implemented in two different models for jet evolution in heavy-ion collisions. Further, we use this procedure to establish that the difference between inclusive jet and $\gamma+$jet nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) is dominated by differences in the spectral shape, leaving the colour charge of the jet initiating parton with a lesser role to play. Additionally, we compare $Q_{AA}$ to an experimentally proposed proxy for fractional jet energy loss, $S_{loss}$, showing that both quantities are similar, although the former provides a more clear physical interpretation. Finally, we show the size of the $p_T$ migration correction for four different substructure observables and how to reliably use the quantile procedure experimentally to improve existing measurements.</description>

      <title>Resummed jet mass distribution with trimming in Z+jet events at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the resummed jet mass distribution up to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for jets defined with the trimming groomer in Z+jet events at the LHC. We compute at fixed order and to all orders the large logarithms, both in the jet mass and $z_{\mathrm{cut}}$ trimming variable, including non-global and clustering logarithms. We conduct phenomenological studies at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, validating our results by comparing them with the fixed-order Monte Carlo program MCFM, which provides NLO predictions for hadron colliders. The resummation of non-global logarithms is estimated in the large-$\mathrm{N_c}$ limit. Our resummed result is compared to Monte Carlo parton shower simulations from Pythia 8, Herwig ++ and Sherpa 2 event generators.</description>

      <title>Magnetized neutral 2SC color superconductivity and possible origin of the inner magnetic field of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the neutral 2SC phase of color superconductivity is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field and for diquark coupling constants and baryonic densities that are expected to characterize neutron stars. Specifically, the behavior of the charged gluons Meissner masses is investigated in the parameter region of interest taking into account in addition the contribution of a rotated magnetic field. It is found that up to moderately-high diquark coupling constants the mentioned Meissner masses become tachyonic independently of the applied magnetic field amplitude, hence signalizing the chromomagnetic instability of this phase. To remove the instability, it is proposed the restructuring of the system ground state, which now will be formed by vortices of the rotated charged gluons. These vortices boost the applied magnetic field having the most significant increase for relatively low applied magnetic fields. Finally, considering that with the stellar rotational frequency observed for magnetars a field of order $10^8$ G can be generated by dynamo effect. Then, we show that by the boosting effect just described the field can be amplified to $10^{17}$ G that is in the range of inner core fields expected for magnetars. Thus, we conclude that the described mechanism could be the one responsible for the large fields characterizing magnetars if the core of this compact objects are formed by neutral 2SC matter.</description>

      <title>SKA Sensitivity to Potential Radio Emission from Dark Matter Annihilation in Ursa Major III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered stellar system, Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1, may be the faintest and densest dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Owing to its close proximity and substantial dark matter (DM) component, Ursa Major III emerges as a highly promising target for DM indirect detection. It is known that electrons and positrons originating from DM annihilation can generate a broad radio spectrum through the processes of synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering within galaxies. In this study, we investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in detecting radio signatures arising from DM annihilation in Ursa Major III over a 100 hour observation period. Our analysis indicates that the SKA has strong capabilities in detecting these signatures. For instance, the SKA sensitivity to the DM annihilation cross section is estimated to reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-30})-\mathcal{O}(10^{-28})\; \rm cm^{3} s^{-1}$ in the DM mass range from several GeV to $\sim100$ GeV for the $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ annihilation channels. The precise results are significantly influenced by various astrophysical factors, such as the strength of magnetic field, the diffusion coefficient, and the DM density profile in the dwarf galaxy. We discuss the impact of the uncertainties associated with these factors, and find that the SKA sensitivities have the potential to surpass the current constraints, even when considering these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Baryon number transportation over full rapidity space in pp collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of anti-baryon to baryon ratio is considered to be a useful tool for studying baryon number transport in pp, pA and AA collisions. For this study, the Pythia event generator with various tunes is used to measure the ${\Anti-Lamda}$/$\Lamda$ ratio as a function of rapidity (y), transverse momentum (pT ), and multiplicity within both ALICE and LHCb acceptances. The results obtained using various MC data for pp collisions at \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV are compared with the experimentally measured values of ${\Anti-Lamda}$/$\Lamda$ ratio of ALICE and LHCb experiments. Out of the various studied tunes of Pythia 8.3, the string junction model is found to be the most successful in describing the experimentally observed results. Evidence of a considerable amount of baryon number transportation from the beam fragmentation to the ALICE and LHCb acceptances could be recognised.</description>

      <title>Non-Holomorphic Modular $\mathcal{A}_4$ Symmetric Scotogenic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work extends scotogenic and its modular $\mathcal{A}_4$ variation a step forward and demonstrates scotogenic modular $\mathcal{A}_4$ non-supersymmetric realization. To achieve this non-holomorphic modular symmetries come to rescue. Advantage of the current construction is the compactness of the model content and absence of the supersymmetric fields. Neutrino mass is generated through a canonical scotogenic mechanism. The allowed values of the VEV of the $\tau$ modulus are $\tau \simeq w$ and Im$[\tau]\approx 2$. The non-holomorphic modular $\mathcal{A}_4$ symmetry leads to correlations among the neutrino observables.</description>

      <title>Is Tokenization Needed for Masked Particle Modelling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we significantly enhance masked particle modeling (MPM), a self-supervised learning scheme for constructing highly expressive representations of unordered sets relevant to developing foundation models for high-energy physics. In MPM, a model is trained to recover the missing elements of a set, a learning objective that requires no labels and can be applied directly to experimental data. We achieve significant performance improvements over previous work on MPM by addressing inefficiencies in the implementation and incorporating a more powerful decoder. We compare several pre-training tasks and introduce new reconstruction methods that utilize conditional generative models without data tokenization or discretization. We show that these new methods outperform the tokenized learning objective from the original MPM on a new test bed for foundation models for jets, which includes using a wide variety of downstream tasks relevant to jet physics, such as classification, secondary vertex finding, and track identification.</description>

      <title>Potential of Neutrino Telescopes to Detect Quantum Gravity-Induced Decoherence in the Presence of Dark Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the potential of neutrino telescopes to discover quantum-gravity-induced decoherence effects modeled in the open-quantum system framework and with arbitrary numbers of active and dark fermion generations, such as particle dark matter or sterile neutrinos. The expected damping of neutrino flavor oscillation probabilities as a function of energy and propagation length thus encodes information about quantum gravity effects and the fermion generation multiplicity in the dark sector. We employ a public Monte-Carlo dataset by the IceCube Collaboration to model the detector response and estimate the sensitivity of IceCube to oscillation effects induced by the presented model. Our findings confirm the potential of very-large-volume neutrino telescopes to test this class of models and indicate higher sensitivities for increasing numbers of dark fermions.</description>

      <title>T-odd observables from anomalous $tbW$ couplings in single-top production at an $ep$ collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that an imaginary anomalous $tbW$ coupling can be measured in the process $e^-p \to \nu_e \overline t X$ by means of T-odd observables. One such observable considered here is the polarization of the top antiquark transverse to the production plane. The other is a T-odd correlation constructed out of observable momenta when the top quark decays leptonically. Both these T-odd observables are shown to be proportional to the imaginary part of only one of the $tbW$ anomalous couplings, the other couplings giving either vanishing or negligible contribution. This imaginary part could signal either a CP-odd coupling, or an absorptive part in the effective coupling, or both. We estimate the 1-$\sigma$ limits that might be derived in the case of each of these observables for a collider with a proton energy of 7 TeV and an electron energy of 60 GeV and also in the case of a higher electron energy of 150 GeV.</description>

      <title>The \pi^+\pi^- Coulomb interaction study and its use in the data processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the Coulomb effects (Coulomb correlations) in $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs produced in p + Ni collisions at 24 GeV/$c$, are studied using experimental $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair distributions in $Q$, the relative momentum in the pair center of mass system (c.m.s), and its projections $Q_L$ (longitudinal component) and $Q_t$ (transverse component) relative to the pair direction in the laboratory system (l.s.).
  The $Q$, $Q_L$, and $Q_t$ distributions of the {\sl Coulomb pairs} in the c.m.s. have been simulated assuming they are described by the phase space modified by the known point-like Coulomb correlation function $A_C(Q)$, corrected for small effects due to the nonpoint-like pair production and the strong two-pion interaction. The same distributions of {\sl non-Coulomb pairs} have been simulated according to the phase space, but without $A_C(Q)$.
  It is shown that the number of {\sl Coulomb pairs} in all $Q_t$ intervals, including the small $Q_t$ (small opening angles $\theta$ in the l.s.) is calculated with the theoretical precision better than 2\%.
  The comparison of the simulated and experimental numbers of {\sl Coulomb pairs} at small $Q_t$ allows us to check and correct the detection efficiency for the pairs with small $\theta$ (0.06 mrad and smaller).
  It is shown that {\sl Coulomb pairs} can be used as a new physical tool to check and correct the quality of the simulated events. The special property of the {\sl Coulomb pairs} is the possibility of checking and correcting the detection efficiency, especially for the pairs with small opening angles.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of heavy-flavor jet angularities in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of heavy-flavor jet angularities ($\lambda_{\kappa}^{\alpha}$) in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The initial production of heavy-flavor jets is carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, while the jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described by the SHELL transport model. In p+p collisions, we observe narrower angularity distributions for the D$^0$-tagged jets compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the preliminary ALICE results. We then demonstrate that jet quenching in the QGP may slightly widen the angularity distributions of both inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $10&lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. Additionally, by comparing the averaged angularities $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ of inclusive, D$^0$-tagged and B$^0$-tagged jets with varying $\alpha$ and $\kappa$, we show that the larger the quark mass is, the lower the jet's $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ values are. As a result of the slenderer initial distribution, we predict that as compared to inclusive jets, the heavy-flavor jets, especially the B$^0$-tagged one, will suffer more distinct modifications of $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p at $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. For a larger jet radius, a more significant broadening of jet angularities could be obtained because of the enhanced contributions of the wide-angle particles. It is also noted that the angularity distributions of inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets become narrower in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $p_{\rm T,jet} &gt; 20$ GeV/c due to the strong influence of the selection bias.</description>

      <title>Implication of the Weizsacker-Williams approximation for the dark matter mediator production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplified connection between Standard Model (SM) particles and light dark matter (LDM) can be introduced via spin-0 and spin-1 lepton-specific mediators. Moreover, in a mediator mass range from sub-MeV to sub-GeV, fixed-target facilities such as NA64$e$, LDMX, NA64$\mu$, and M$^3$ can potentially probe such particles of the hidden sector via missing energy signatures that are described by the bremsstrahlung-like process involving leptons. We compare the Weizsaker-Williams (WW) approximation and the exact tree-level (ETL) approach for the bremsstrahlung-like mediator production cross section by choosing various parameters of the fixed-target experiments. We show that the relative difference between the total cross sections calculated in the WW and ETL approximation varies from $\mathcal{O}(1)~\%$ to $\mathcal{O}(10)~\%$ for a muon mode and from $\mathcal{O}(-20)~\%$ to $\mathcal{O}(80)~\%$ for an electron mode. We argue that the main difference between two approaches for electron beam mode arises from peak forward region of the cross section. We also discuss the impact of parametrization of nuclear and atomic elastic form-factors on the total cross section. In particular, we show that the employing different form-factor parametrization can lead to a uncertainty in the cross section at the level of $\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\%$. That study may be helpful for the lepton fixed-target experiments that examine the bremsstrahlung-like production of the DM mediators.</description>

      <title>Discovery potential of a long-lived partner of inelastic dark matter at MATHUSLA in $U(1)_{X_3}$ extension of the standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential at the MATHUSLA experiment of a long-lived particle (LLP), which is the heavier state of inelastic scalar dark matter (DM) in third generation-philic $U(1)$ ($U(1)_{X_3}$) extension of the standard model. Since the heavier state and DM state form the complex scalar charged under the $U(1)_{X_3}$, it is natural that the heavier state $P$ is almost degenerate with the DM state and hence long-lived. We find that third generation-philic right-handed $U(1)$, $U(1)_{R_3}$, model is the most interesting, because third generation-philic models are less constrained by the current experimental results and right-handed $U(1)$ interactions leave visible final decay products without produing neutrinos. For a benchmark of the model parameters consistent with the current phenomenological constraints, we find that the travel distance of the LLP can be $\mathcal{O}(100)$ m and the LLP production cross section at the 14 TeV LHC can be $\mathcal{O}(10)$ fb. Thus, we conclude that the LLP can be discovered at the MATHUSLA with a sufficiently large number of LLP decay events inside the MATHUSLA detector.</description>

      <title>Hadronic scattering effects on $\psi(2S)$ suppression in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the $N_{\psi(2S)} / N_{J/\psi}$ yield ratio in heavy-ion collisions, considering the interactions of the $\psi (2S) $ and $J/\psi$ states with light mesons in the hadron gas formed at the late stages of these collisions. Starting from the appropriate effective Lagrangians, we first compute the thermally-averaged cross sections for the production and absorption of the mentioned states, and then use them as input in the rate equations to determine the time evolution of $N_{\psi(2S)}$, $N_{J/\psi}$ and $N_{\psi(2S)} / N_{J/\psi}$. The main conclusion of our study is that the $\psi (2S) $ and $J/\psi$ multiplicities do not change much in the hadron gas phase and that the $\psi (2S)$ is more absorbed than the $J/\psi$. The obtained final ratio is in qualitative agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss models in which vectorlike quarks and a second Higgs doublet are simultaneously present and couple to the third generation of SM quarks. A general feature of these models is that cascade decays of vectorlike fermions into heavy Higgses (or vice versa, depending on their masses) dominate their respective branching ratios. The resulting collider signals involve a large multiplicity of $b$-jets and offer formidable experimental challenges. We present a detailed and realistic analysis of the expected sensitivity of dedicated searches at ATLAS and CMS.</description>

      <title>Flavor Hierarchy of Jet Energy Correlators inside the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy flavor jets provide ideal tools to probe the mass effect on jet substructure in both vacuum and quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an excellent jet substructure observable owning to its strong sensitivity to jet physics at different scales. We perform a complete realistic simulation on medium modification of heavy and light flavor jet EEC in heavy-ion collisions. A clear flavor hierarchy is observed for jet EEC in both vacuum and QGP due to the mass effect. The medium modification of inclusive jet EEC at different angular scales exhibits very rich structure: suppression at intermediate angles, and enhancement at small and large angles, which can be well explained by the interplay of mass effect, energy loss, medium-induced radiation and medium response. These unique features of jet EEC are shown to probe the physics of jet-medium interaction at different scales, and can be readily validated by upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking Glass into the Dark Dimension: Searching for Bulk Black Hole Dark Matter with Microlensing of X-ray Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) hidden in the incredible bulk of the dark dimension could escape constraints from non-observation of their Hawking radiation. Since these five-dimensional (5D) PBHs are bigger, colder, and longer-lived than usual 4D PBHs of the same mass $M$, they could make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$, i.e., extending the 4D allowed region far down the asteroid-mass window. We show that these evasive PBHs could be search for by measuring their $X$-ray microlensing events from faraway pulsars. We also show that future $X$-ray microlensing experiments will be able to probe the interesting range ($10^{16.5} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{17.5}~{\rm g}$) where an all dark matter interpretation in terms of 4D Schwarzschild PBHs is excluded by the non-observation of their Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>SModelS v3: Going Beyond Z2 Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SModelS is a public tool for fast reinterpretation of LHC searches for new physics based on a large database of simplified model results. While previous versions were limited to models with a Z2-type symmetry, such as R-parity conserving supersymmetry, version 3 can now handle arbitrary signal topologies. To this end, the tool was fully restructured and now relies on a graph-based description of simplified model topologies. In this work, we present the main conceptual changes and novel features of SModelS v3, together with the inclusion of new experimental searches for resonant production of spin-1 and spin-0 mediators with decays to quarks or to dark matter. Applying these results to a model containing two mediators, we discuss the interplay of resonance and missing energy searches, and the model's coverage by the currently available simplified model results.</description>

      <title>Dark dimension with (little) strings attached</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We motivate a relation between dark energy and the scale of new physics in weakly coupled string theory. This mixing between infrared and ultraviolet physics leads to a unique corner for real-world phenomenology: barring fine-tunings, we are naturally led to the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a single mesoscopic extra dimension of micron size with the standard model localized on D-branes. Our explicit top-down worldsheet derivation establishes it on a more solid grounding. Allowing some fine-tuning, such that the vacuum energy only arise at higher orders in string perturbation theory, the ``little string theory'' scenario with a very weakly coupled string is an alternative possibility. In this case, the string scale lies at the edge of detectability of particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Quantum integration of decay rates at second order in perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first quantum computation of a total decay rate in high-energy physics at second order in perturbative quantum field theory. This work underscores the confluence of two recent cutting-edge advances. On the one hand, the quantum integration algorithm Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which efficiently decomposes the target function into its Fourier series through a quantum neural network before quantumly integrating the corresponding Fourier components. On the other hand, causal unitary in the loop-tree duality (LTD), which exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in LTD to coherently generate all contributions with different numbers of final-state particles to a scattering or decay process, leading to singularity-free integrands that are well suited for Fourier decomposition. We test the performance of the quantum algorithm with benchmark decay rates in a quantum simulator and in quantum hardware, and find accurate theoretical predictions in both settings.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Wave Counterpart to a Gamma-ray Galactic Center Signal from Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new tools of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy allow for the study of astrophysical phenomenon in new ways and enables light to be shed on some of the longest-enduring mysteries of high-energy astrophysics. Among the latter stands the Galactic center gamma-ray excess, associated with a source whose nature could be annihilating dark matter or a yet-unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). MSPs are most likely asymmetric about their axis of rotation, and are thus thought to also source quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves, that dark matter processes would not emit. Using statistical methods, we simulate realistic MSP population samples with differing morphology and moment of inertia, that could give rise to the gamma-ray excess, and we compute the corresponding gravitational wave signal amplitude and frequency. We find that the gravitational wave signal frequency likely ranges between $\sim$200 and 1400 Hz, and that the collective dimensionless strain from the center of the Galaxy has an amplitude between $10^{-26}$ and $10^{-24}$, thus most likely beyond current and near-term detectors, unless the unresolved MSPs are extraordinarily gamma-ray dim.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-Loop four-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop four-point MHV form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). This form factor is analogous to the Higgs plus four-gluon amplitudes in the heavy-top limit of QCD when translated to the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM context. We obtain the full $D$-dimensional integrands up to two loops via unitarity-cut methods. Subsequently, we utilize IBP reduction to express the result in terms of a set of uniformly transcendental basis integrals, incorporating the two-loop non-planar five-point one-mass integrals recently given by Abreu et al. [PRL 132 (2024) 14]. We obtain the two-loop finite remainder in the functional form in terms of the pentagon functions. The symbol of our remainder confirms the bootstrap results reported by Dixon et al. [PRL 130 (2023) 11]. We perform various non-trivial checks of our results, including the triple-collinear limit, which recovers the two-loop six-gluon remainder. We also show that the form factor has a directional dual conformal symmetry at the integrand level. Our results are expected to shed further light on the study of antipodal dualities and the computation of Higgs plus four-parton amplitudes in QCD.</description>

Abstract: We give an explanation of the $\mathrm{d}\log$-form of the coefficient matrix of canonical differential equations using the projection of ($n$+1)-$\mathrm{d}\log$ forms onto $n$-$\mathrm{d}\log$ forms. This projection is done using the leading-order formula for intersection numbers. This formula gives a simple way to compute the coefficient matrix. When combined with the relative twisted cohomology, redundancy in computation using the regulator method can be avoided.</description>

Abstract: We present a neural network classification model for detecting the presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom in neutron stars. The models take radii and/or tidal deformabilities as input and give the probability for the presence of hyperons in the neutron star composition. Different numbers of observations and different levels of uncertainty in the neutron star properties are tested. The models have been trained on a dataset of well-calibrated microscopic equations of state of neutron star matter based on a relativistic mean-field formalism. Real data and data generated from a different description of hyperonic matter are used to test the performance of the models.</description>

      <title>Shaping Dark Photon Spectral Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is an extraordinary tool for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. The exquisite precision of the measurement makes it particularly sensitive to small effects caused by hidden sector interactions. In particular, CMB spectral distortions can unveil the existence of dark photons which are kinetically coupled to the standard photon. In this work, we use the COBE-FIRAS dataset to derive accurate and robust limits on photon-to-dark-photon oscillations for a large range of dark photon masses, from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-4}$ eV. We consider in detail the redshift dependence of the bounds, computing CMB distortions due to photon injection/removal using a Green's function method. Our treatment improves on previous results, which had set limits studying energy injection/removal into baryons rather than photon injection/removal, or ignored the redshift evolution of distortions. The difference between our treatment and previous ones is particularly noticeable in the predicted spectral shape of the distortions, a smoking gun signature for photon-to-dark-photon oscillations. The characterization of the spectral shape is crucial for future CMB missions, which could improve the present sensitivity by orders of magnitude, exploring regions of the dark photon parameter space that are otherwise difficult to access.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Axion-like Curvaton: Non-Gaussianity and Primordial Black Holes Without Large Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Phenomenology in 2HDMS in light of the 95 GeV excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Two Higgs Doublet model extended with a complex scalar singlet (2HDMS) is a well-motivated Beyond Standard Model candidate addressing several open problems of nature. In this work, we focus on the dark matter (DM) phenomenology of the complex scalar singlet where the real part of the complex scalar obtains a vacuum expectation value. The model is characterized by an enlarged Higgs spectrum comprising six physical Higgs bosons and a pseudoscalar DM candidate. We address the impact of accommodating the 95 GeV excess on the 2HDMS parameter space and DM observables after including all theoretical and experimental constraints. Finally, we look into the prospects of this scenario at HL-LHC and future lepton colliders for a representative benchmark.</description>

      <title>A TMD-based model for Hadronization off heavy nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off nuclei is a unique process to study the parton propagation mechanism and its modification induced by the presence of the nuclear medium. It allows us to probe the medium properties, particularly the cold nuclear matter transport coefficient, which can be directly linked to the nuclear gluon density. We present here a model for hadron production in deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering, which takes into account the hadronic transverse momentum of final state particles via transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions and fragmentation functions. We implement parton energy loss and hadronic absorption with a geometrical model of the nucleus. The model is compared with the nuclear SIDIS multiplicity ratios and transverse-momentum broadening data from the CLAS, HERMES, and EMC collaborations, aiming for a simultaneous description of these data sets. We obtain a good agreement over the various nuclear targets and the wide kinematical range of those experiments. We best describe the data with a transport coefficient \hat{q} = 0.3 GeV/fm^2, and we highlight the importance and the role of correlations in extracting this quantity.</description>

      <title>A complex singlet extension of the Standard Model with a singlet fermion dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a complex singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with an extra singlet fermion. Both the singlet scalar and fermion are dark matter (DM) candidates. It is known that although the scalar potential in the CxSM can realize strong first-order electroweak phase transition, the scalar DM included in the model gives only a tiny amount of the relic density compared to the observed one. Therefore, a fermion DM is introduced to compensate for the lack of relic density. We find that the scattering of the fermion DM and nucleons is sufficiently suppressed when the masses of scalar mediators are degenerate, as well as in the case of the scalar DM. We show the range of a combination of the mass and the Yukawa coupling of the fermion DM, which satisfies both the observed relic density and conditions of strong first-order electroweak phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Future $e^+e^-$ colliders are called to play a fundamental role in measuring Standard Model (SM) parameters with unprecedented precision and the discovery of physics beyond the SM (BSM). This study focus on a QCD-like Hidden Valley (HV) scenario, with relatively light v-quarks ($\lesssim 100$ GeV), perturbing the QCD partonic cascade and increasing azimuthal and (pseudo)rapidity correlations of final-state SM hadrons. Using Pythia8 and detector fast simulation tools we study $ridge$-$like$ structures arising in the two-particle angular correlation function, including selection cuts and detector effects.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Search with Space-Time Separated Atomic Clocks and Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise and demonstrate a method to search for non-gravitational couplings of ultralight dark matter to standard model particles using space-time separated atomic clocks and cavity-stabilized lasers. By making use of space-time separated sensors, which probe different values of an oscillating dark matter field, we can search for couplings that cancel in typical local experiments. This provides sensitivity to both the temporal and spatial fluctuations of the field. We demonstrate this method using existing data from a frequency comparison of lasers stabilized to two optical cavities connected via a 2220 km fiber link [Schioppo et al., Nat. Commun. 13, 212 (2022)], and from the atomic clocks on board the Global Position System satellites. Our analysis results in constraints on the coupling of scalar dark matter to electrons, d_me, for masses between 1e-19 eV/c^2 and 2e-15 eV/c^2. These are the first constraints on d_me alone in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Identifying regions in wide-angle scattering via graph-theoretical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The method of regions, which provides a systematic approach for computing Feynman integrals involving multiple kinematic scales, proposes that a Feynman integral can be approximated and even reproduced by summing over integrals expanded in certain regions. A modern perspective of the method of regions considers any given Feynman integral as a specific Newton polytope, defined as the convex hull of the points associated with Symanzik polynomials. The regions then correspond one-to-one with the lower facets of this polytope.
  As Symanzik polynomials correspond to the spanning trees and spanning 2-trees of the Feynman graph, a graph-theoretical study of these polynomials may allow us to identify the complete set of regions for a given expansion. In this work, our primary focus is on three specific expansions: the on-shell expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, the soft expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, and the mass expansion of heavy-to-light decay. For each of these expansions, we employ graph-theoretical approaches to derive the generic forms of the regions involved in the method of regions. The results, applicable to all orders, offer insights that can be leveraged to investigate various aspects of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Constraining CP violating nucleon-nucleon long range interactions in diatomic eEDM searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The searches for CP violating effects in diatomic molecules, such as $\text{HfF}^+$ and ThO, are typically interpreted as a probe of the electron's electric dipole moment ($e\text{EDM}$), a new electron-nucleon interaction, and a new electron-electron interaction. However, in the case of a nonvanishing nuclear spin, a new CP violating nucleon-nucleon long range force will also affect the measurement. Here, we use the $\text{HfF}^+$ $e\text{EDM}$ search and derive a new bound on this hypothetical interaction, which is the most stringent from terrestrial experiments in the 1 eV-10 keV mass range. These multiple new physics sources motivate independent searches in different molecular species for CP violation at low energy that result in model independent bounds, which are insensitive to cancellation among them.</description>

Abstract: In this review, we present the key aspects of modern thermal perturbation theory based on the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation, including its theoretical foundations and applications within quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) plasmas. To maintain conciseness, we focus on scenarios in thermal equilibrium, examining a variety of physical quantities and settings. Specifically, we explore both bulk thermodynamic properties and real-time observables in high-temperature domains relevant to heavy-ion physics.</description>

Abstract: Light mesons have always been an important part of the whole hadron family, once inspiring the SU(3) classification of hadrons as a typical example~\cite{Gell-Mann:1964ewy}. Until now, the search for light mesons has been an ongoing task in hadron physics. In particular, with the accumulation of experimental data, more and more light flavor mesons with the masses around 2.2 GeV were found, including the $Y(2175)$ observed in $J/\psi\to \eta \phi f_0(980)$~\cite{BES:2007sqy} and the $X(2370)$ reported in the decay of $J/\psi\to \gamma \eta^\prime \pi^+\pi^-$~\cite{BESIII:2010gmv,BESIII:2019wkp}. These progresses show that there is a chance to construct the light meson family, which is also an effective approach to deepen our understanding of non-perturbative behavior of the strong interaction.</description>

Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles, as leading dark matter candidates, can also have interesting implications for dark matter substructures if the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken after inflation. In such a scenario, axion perturbations on small scales will lead to the formation of axion miniclusters at matter-radiation equality, and subsequently the formation of axion stars. Such compact objects open new windows for indirect searches for axions. We compute the axion star mass function based on recent axion minicluster studies and Bose star simulations. Applying this mass function, we find post-inflation axion-like particles with masses $1.8 \times 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}&lt;m_a&lt; 3.3 \times 10^{-17}~{\rm eV}$ are constrained by the lack of dynamical heating of stars in ultrafaint dwarfs. We also find that current microlensing surveys are insensitive to QCD axion stars. While we focus on the gravitational detectability of axion stars, our result can be directly applied to other interesting signatures of axion stars, e.g. their decay to photons, that require as input the abundance, mass, and density distribution of axion stars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling desert region in inert doublet model assisted by Peccei-Quinn symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Inert Higgs Doublet model (IDM), assisted by Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, offers a simple but natural framework of a dark sector that accommodates Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) and axion as dark matter components. Spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry, which was originally proposed as an elegant solution to the strong charge-parity (CP) problem, also ensures the stability of WIMP through a residual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Interestingly, additional fields necessitated by PQ symmetry further enrich the dark sector. These include a scalar field proprietor for axion DM and a vector-like quark (VLQ) that acts as a portal for the dark sector through Yukawa interactions. Moreover, this combination of the axion and WIMP components satisfies the observed DM relic density and reopens the phenomenologically exciting region of the IDM parameter space where the WIMP mass falls between 100 - 550 GeV. We investigate the model-independent pair production of VLQs exploring this region at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), incorporating the effects of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections. After production, each VLQ decays into a top or bottom quark accompanied by an inert scalar, a consequence of the residual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Utilising relevant observables with a leptonic search channel and employing multivariate analysis, we demonstrate the ability of this analysis to exclude a significant portion of the parameter space with an integrated luminosity of 300 $\text{fb}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Studying the $\Xi(2030)$ as a predominantly $\bar{K}^{*}\Sigma$ molecular state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its discovery in 1977, the spin-parity of $\Xi(2030)$ has not been fully determined experimentally. The latest Particle Data Group (PDG) listing suggests it may be a baryon with $J=5/2$. Therefore, studying the mass spectrum and decay properties of $\Xi(2030)$ has become a current hot topic to definitively establish its spin-parity. As the three-quark model fails to explain $\Xi(2030)$, we previously proposed it may be a molecule primarily composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$ with $J^P=5/2^{+}$, based on its mass spectrum study. To verify its molecular state interpretation, this work proposes studying the strong decays of $\Xi(2030)$ assuming it is a $P$-wave $J^P=5/2^{+}$ meson-baryon molecule predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$. We calculated all experimentally measured two-body and three-body final state decay widths of $\Xi(2030)$, including $\Xi(2030) \to \bar{K}\Lambda, \bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\Xi, \pi\Xi^{*}$, and $\Xi(2030) \to \pi\pi\Xi, \pi\bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\bar{K}\Lambda$. The results indicate that both the total decay width and partial decay widths agree well with experimental values within the error margins. This supports that $\Xi(2030)$ is a molecule with spin-parity $J^P = 5/2^{+}$, predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{*}\Sigma$. Compared to the experimental central values, our results are slightly smaller, which suggests that $\Xi(2030)$ may contain additional components besides meson-baryon molecular components, such as three quark structures.</description>

Abstract: A muon collider represents a promising candidate for the next generation of particle physics experiments after the expected end of LHC operations in the early 2040s. Rare or hard-to-detect processes at the LHC, such as the production of multiple gauge bosons, become accessible at a TeV muon collider. We present here the prospects of detecting quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities in H to ZZ to 4l events at a potential future muon collider. We show that the spin density matrix of the Z boson pairs can be reconstructed using the kinematics of the charged leptons from the Z boson decays. Once the density matrix is determined, it is straightforward to obtain the expectation values of various Bell operators and test the quantum entanglement between the Z boson pair. Through a detailed study based on Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the generalized CGLMP inequality can be maximally violated, and testing Bell inequalities could be established with high significance.</description>

This model is in favor of the light dark $Z$ boson, $Z'$, and the light additional neutral Higgs boson, $h$. We find that $H^\pm \to W^\pm h$ and the $H^\pm \to W^\pm Z'$ are dominant decay channels. Thus the promising final states are trilepton signals, $e \mu \mu$ or $\mu \mu \mu$ following $Z' \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and leptonic decays of the $W^\pm$ boson. The charged Higgs boson will be produced from the top quark decays $t \to b H^\pm$ following $t \bar{t}$ production, if $H^\pm$ is light. Whereas $H^\pm$ is heavier than the top quark, the dominant production processes are associated productions with either $Z'$ or $h$, $pp \to W^\star \to H^\pm h$ and $pp \to W^\star \to H^\pm Z'$. We explore the discovery potential of the charged Higgs boson at the LHC. We also discuss the implications of dark matter in relation with the charged Higgs phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Unified study of nucleon and $\Delta$ baryon spectra and their strong decays with chiral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we systematically study both the mass spectra and strong decays of the nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances up to the $N=2$ shell within a unified quark model framework with chiral dynamics. In this framework we achieve a good description of the strong decay properties of the well-established nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances. Meanwhile, the mass reversal between $N(1440)1/2^{+}$ as the first radial excitation state and the $1P$-wave nucleon resonances can be explained. We show that the three-body spin-orbit potential arising from the one-gluon exchange can cause a large configuration mixing between $N(1520)3/2^-$ and $N(1700)3/2^-$, and is also responsible for the large splitting between $\Delta(1600)1/2^-$ and $\Delta(1700)3/2^-$. Some of these baryon resonances turn to weakly couple to the $N\pi$, $N\eta$, $K\Lambda$, and $K\Sigma$ channels, which may answer the question why they have not been established in these channels via the $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ scatterings. It shows that these ``missing resonances" may have large potentials to be established in the $N\pi\pi$ final state due to their large decay rates into either the $\Delta(1232)$ or $1P$-wave nucleon resonances via the pionic decays. Further experimental search for their signals in charmonium decays at BESIII is thus strongly recommended.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field in a cavity induced by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection method of gravitational waves (GW) using electromagnetic (EM) cavities has garnered significant attention in recent years. This paper thoroughly examines the analysis for the perturbation of the EM field and raises some issues in the existing literature. Our work demonstrates that the rigidity condition imposed on the material, as provided in the literature, is inappropriate due to its reliance on a gauge-dependent quantity that cannot be controlled experimentally. Instead, we incorporate elasticity into the material and revise the governing equations for the electric field induced by GWs, expressing them solely in terms of gauge-invariant quantities. Applying these equations to cylindrical cavities, we present the GW antenna patterns for the detector.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Neutrino Decoupling and its Observable Imprints: Insights from Entropic-Dual Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very different processes characterize the decoupling of neutrinos to form the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) and the much later decoupling of photons from thermal equilibrium to form the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The C$\nu$B emerges from the fuzzy, energy-dependent neutrinosphere and encodes the physics operating in the early universe in the temperature range $T\sim 10\,{\rm MeV}$ to $T\sim10\,{\rm keV}$. This is the epoch where beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics may be influential in setting the light element abundances and the necessarily distorted fossil neutrino energy spectra. Here we use techniques honed in extensive CMB studies to analyze the C$\nu$B as calculated in detailed neutrino energy transport and nuclear reaction simulations. Our moment method, relative entropy, and differential visibility approach can leverage future high precision CMB and primordial abundance measurements to provide new insights into the C$\nu$B and any BSM physics it encodes. We demonstrate that the evolution of the energy spectrum of the C$\nu$B throughout the weak decoupling epoch is accurately captured in the Standard Model by only three parameters per species, a non-trivial conclusion given the deviation from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we can interpret each of the three parameters as physical characteristics of a non-equilibrium system. The success of our compact description within the Standard Model motivates its use also in BSM scenarios. We demonstrate how observations of primordial light element abundances can be used to place constraints on the C$\nu$B energy spectrum, deriving response functions that can be applied for general C$\nu$B spectral distortions. Combined with the description of those deviations that we develop here, our methods provide a convenient and powerful framework to constrain the impact of BSM physics on the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute {$f_{\mathrm{PBH}}=5.66^{+58.68}_{-5.44}\times 10^{-2}$ } of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <title>Extended NJL model for baryonic matter and quark matter</title>

Abstract: By considering baryons as clusters of three quarks, we extend the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to describe baryonic matter, quark matter, and their transitions in a unified manner, where the Dirac sea and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are considered. In particular, a density-dependent structural function $\alpha_S$ is introduced to modulate the four(six)-point interaction strengths to reproduce the baryon masses in vacuum and medium. Vector interactions are considered with the exchange of $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons, where the density-dependent coupling constants are fixed by reproducing nuclear matter properties as well as the $\Lambda$-hyperon potential depth in nuclear medium. As density increases, quarks will emerge as quasi-free particles and coexist with baryons. This phase is interpreted as quarkyonic matter, where quarks are restricted to the lowest energy states in the presence of baryons, i.e., quarks are still confined. Similar to the treatment of $\alpha$ clustering in nuclear medium, a Pauli blocking term is added to baryon masses so that baryons eventually become unbound in the presence of a quark Fermi Sea. Then at large enough densities baryons vanish and a Mott transition takes place, we consider such a transition as deconfinement phase transition. Depending on the strengths of Pauli blocking term and quark-vector meson couplings, both first-order and continues phase transitions are observed for quarkyonic, chiral, and deconfinement phase transitions. The corresponding compact star structures are then investigated and confronted with various astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Bootstrap: Using Transformers to Compute Scattering Amplitudes in Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pursue the use of deep learning methods to improve state-of-the-art computations in theoretical high-energy physics. Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory is a close cousin to the theory that describes Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider; its scattering amplitudes are large mathematical expressions containing integer coefficients. In this paper, we apply Transformers to predict these coefficients. The problem can be formulated in a language-like representation amenable to standard cross-entropy training objectives. We design two related experiments and show that the model achieves high accuracy (&gt; 98%) on both tasks. Our work shows that Transformers can be applied successfully to problems in theoretical physics that require exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star matter from the slope of the mass-radius curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the implications of information about local derivatives from the mass-radius diagram in neutron star matter. It is expected that the next generation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic detectors will allow the determination of the neutron star radius and mass with a small uncertainty. Observations of neutron stars clustered around a given neutron star mass allow the estimation of local derivatives in the $M(R)$ diagram, which can be used to constrain neutron star properties. From a model-independent description of the neutron star equation of state, it is shown that a $M(R)$ curve with a negative slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ predicts a $2M_\odot$ neutron star radius below 12 km. Furthermore, a maximum mass below 2.3$M_\odot$ is obtained if the $M(R)$ slope is negative in the whole range of masses above $1M_\odot$, and a maximum mass above 2.4$M_\odot$ requires the $M(R)$ slope to be positive in some range of masses. Constraints on the mass-radius curve of neutron stars will place strong constraints on microscopic models.</description>

Abstract: The matrix of canonical differential equations consists of the 1-$\mathrm{d}\log$-form coefficients obtained by projecting ($n$+1)-$\mathrm{d}\log$-forms onto $n$-$\mathrm{d}\log$-form master integrands. With dual form in relative cohomology, the intersection number can be used to achieve the projection and provide the selection rules for canonical differential equations, which relate to the pole structure of the $\mathrm{d}\log$ master integrands.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with dark matter: equiparticle model in a two fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoiding the collapse of the star due to the lack of the degeneracy pressure. Our results point out to possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, NICER and HESS J1731-347. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.</description>

      <title>Phases and Phase transitions of U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetric holographic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase diagram and symmetry breaking patterns of a holographic CFT with U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetry are analyzed using the simplest holographic action, namely Einstein-Yang-Mills (YM) theory with a negative cosmological constant. This is relevant for both condensed matter and QCD applications. With a U(1) and an "isospin" chemical potential turned on, we determine all possible symmetry breaking patterns, which are associated to the condensation of spin-one order parameters. The possible IR asymptotics of the Einstein-YM solutions are derived analytically, both for 2+1 and 3+1 boundary dimensions. The competing solutions are then computed numerically, both at zero and non-zero temperature, from which the full three-dimensional phase diagram is determined. We find a surface of second order phase transitions that separate uncondensed and condensed phases. In some regions with a large fraction of charged to neutral degrees of freedom, the phase transition becomes first order.</description>
