      <title>A CMC existence result for expanding cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new CMC (constant mean curvature) existence result for cosmological spacetimes, i.e., globally hyperbolic spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces satisfying the strong energy condition. If the spacetime contains an expanding Cauchy surface and is future timelike geodesically complete, then the spacetime contains a CMC Cauchy surface. This result settles, under certain circumstances, a conjecture of the authors and a conjecture of Dilts and Holst. Our proof relies on the construction of barriers in the support sense, and the CMC Cauchy surface is found as the asymptotic limit of mean curvature flow. Analogous results are also obtained in the case of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda &gt; 0$. Lastly, we include some comments concerning the future causal boundary for cosmological spacetimes which pertain to the CMC conjecture of the authors.</description>

      <title>Introducing Various Notions of Distances between Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of causally-null-compactifiable space-times which can be canonically converted into a compact timed-metric-spaces using the cosmological time of Andersson-Howard-Galloway and the null distance of Sormani-Vega. We produce a large class of such space-times including future developments of compact initial data sets and regions which exhaust asymptotically flat space-times. We then present various notions of intrinsic distances between these space-times (introducing the timed-Hausdorff distance) and prove some of these notions of distance are definite in the sense that they equal zero iff there is a time-oriented Lorentzian isometry between the space-times. These definite distances enable us to define various notions of convergence of space-times to limit space-times which are not necessarily smooth. Many open questions and conjectures are included throughout.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Resurgence of WKB Solutions of Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that formal WKB solutions of Schr\"odinger equations on Riemann surfaces are resurgent. Specifically, they are Borel summable in almost all directions and their Borel transforms admit endless analytic continuation away from a discrete subset of singularities. Our approach is purely geometric, relying on understanding the global geometry of complex flows of meromorphic vector fields using techniques from holomorphic Lie groupoids and the geometry of spectral curves. This framework provides a fully geometric description of the Borel plane, Borel singularities, and the Stokes rays. In doing so, we introduce a geometric perspective on resurgence theory.</description>

      <title>Liouville Theorem with Boundary Conditions from Chern--Gauss--Bonnet Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sigma_k(A_g)$ curvature and the boundary $\mathcal{B}^k_g$ curvature arise naturally from the Chern--Gauss--Bonnet formula for manifolds with boundary. In this paper, we prove a Liouville theorem for the equation $\sigma_k(A_g)=1$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}^n_+}$ with the boundary condition $\mathcal{B}^k_g=c$ on $\partial\mathbb{R}^n_+$, where $g=e^{2v}|dx|^2$ and $c$ is some nonnegative constant. This extends an earlier result of Wei, which assumes the existence of $\lim_{|x|\to\infty}(v(x)+2\log|x|)$. In addition, we establish a local gradient estimate for solutions of such equations, assuming an upper bound on the solution $v$.</description>

      <title>Local index theory and $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any given submersion $\pi:X\to B$ with closed, oriented and spin$^c$ fibers of even dimension, equipped with a Riemannian and differential spin$^c$ structure $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, we construct an analytic index $\textrm{ind}^a_k$ in odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory on the cocycle level by associating to every cocycle $(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$ of the odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory group of $X$ a cocycle $\textrm{ind}^a_k(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$ of the odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory group of $B$. The cocycle $\textrm{ind}^a_k(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$ is defined in terms of the twisted spin$^c$ Dirac operators associated to $(\mathbf{E}, \boldsymbol{\pi})$ and $(\mathbf{F}, \boldsymbol{\pi})$, which are not assumed to satisfy the kernel bundle assumption. We prove a Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck type formula in odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory, which expresses the Cheeger-Chern-Simons form of $\textrm{ind}^a_k(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$ in terms of that of $(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F}, \alpha)$. Furthermore, we show that the analytic index $\textrm{ind}^a_k$ and the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck type formula in odd $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory refine the geometric bundle part of the analytic index and the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ $K$-theory, respectively. An as intermediate result, we give a proof that the analytic indexes in differential $K$-theory defined without the kernel bundle assumption via the Atiyah-Singer-Gorokhovsky-Lott approach and the Miscenko-Fomenko-Freed-Lott approach, respectively, are equal.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous linear symplectic reduction and orbit fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a correspondence between the orbits of the group of linear symplectomorphisms of a real finite dimensional symplectic vector space in the complex Lagrangian Grassmannian and the Grassmannians of linear subspaces of the real symplectic vector space. Under this correspondence, orbit fibration maps whose fibers are holomorphic arc components correspond to fibrations from simultaneous linear symplectic reduction. We use this to compute the homotopy types of Grassmannians of linear subspaces of the symplectic vector space in the general case, recovering the observations of Arnold in the Lagrangian case, Oh-Park in the coisotropic case, and Lee-Leung in the symplectic case. Binary octahedral symmetries, symplectic twistor Grassmannians, and symmetries of Jacobi forms appear within this structure.</description>

      <title>From bubbles to clusters: Multiple solutions to the Allen--Cahn system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend previous works on the multiplicity of solutions to the Allen-Cahn system on closed Riemannian manifolds by considering an arbitrary number of phases. Specifically, we show that on parallelizable manifolds, the number of solutions is bounded from below by topological invariants of the underlying manifold, provided the temperature parameter and volume constraint are sufficiently small. The Allen-Cahn system naturally arises in phase separation models, where solutions represent the distribution of distinct phases in a multi-component mixture. As the temperature parameter approaches zero, the system's energy approximates the multi-isoperimetric profile, leading to solutions concentrating in regions resembling isoperimetric clusters. For two or three phases, these results rely on classifying isoperimetric clusters. However, this classification remains incomplete for a larger number of phases. To address this technical issue, we employ a "volume-fixing variations" approach, enabling us to establish our results for any number of phases and small volume constraints. This offers deeper insights into phase separation phenomena on manifolds with arbitrary geometry.</description>

      <title>Quantum spaces associated to mixed polarizations and their limiting behavior on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X, \omega, J)$ be a toric variety of dimension $2n$ determined by a Delzant polytope $P$. As indicated in [40], $X$ admits a natural mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{k}$, induced by the action of a subtorus $T^{k}$. In this paper, we first establish the quantum space $\mathcal{H}_{k}$ for $\mathcal{P}_{k}$, identifying a basis parameterized by the integer lattice points of $P$. This confirms that the dimension of $\mathcal{H}_{k}$ aligns with those derived from K\"ahler and real polarizations. Secondly, we examine a one-parameter family of K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$, defined via symplectic potentials, and demonstrate their convergence to $\mathcal{P}_{k}$. Thirdly, we verify that these polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$ coincide with those induced by imaginary-time flow. Finally, we explore the relationship between the quantum space $\mathcal{H}_{k,0}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{k}$, establishing that ``$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{H}_{k,t} = \mathcal{H}_{k}$."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study generating series encoding linking numbers between geodesics in arithmetic hyperbolic $3$-folds. We show that the series converge to functions on the genus $2$ Siegel upper-half plane and that certain explicit modifications have the transformation properties of genus $2$ Siegel modular forms of weight $2$. This is done by carefully analysing the integral of the Kudla-Millson theta series over a surface with geodesic boundary.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicit representation formulae of Green functions for GJMS operators on $n$-spheres, including the fractional ones. These formulae have natural geometric interpretations concerning the extrinsic geometry of the round sphere. Conversely, we discover that this special feature uniquely characterizes spheres among closed embedded hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Furthermore, for $n=3,4,5$ we prove a strong rigidity theorem for Green functions of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ using the Positive Mass Theorem.</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a mathematically precise statement of the SYZ conjecture between mirror space pairs and prove it for any toric Calabi-Yau manifold with the Gross Lagrangian fibration. To date, it is the first time we realize the SYZ proposal with singular fibers beyond the topological level. The dual singular fibration is explicitly written and proved to be compatible with the family Floer mirror construction. Moreover, we discover that the Maurer-Cartan set of a singular Lagrangian is only a strict subset of the corresponding dual singular fiber. This responds negatively to the previous expectation and leads to new perspectives of SYZ singularities. As extra evidence, we also check some computations for a well-known folklore conjecture for the Landau-Ginzburg model.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on quantum cohomology from the Floer theory of $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory of polynomials and linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey revolves around the question how the roots of a monic polynomial (resp. the spectral decomposition of a linear operator), whose coefficients depend in a smooth way on parameters, depend on those parameters. The parameter dependence of the polynomials (resp. operators) ranges from real analytic over $C^\infty$ to differentiable of finite order with often drastically different regularity results for the roots (resp. eigenvalues and eigenvectors). Another interesting point is the difference between the perturbation theory of hyperbolic polynomials (where, by definition, all roots are real) and that of general complex polynomials. The subject, which started with Rellich's work in the 1930s, enjoyed sustained interest through time that intensified in the last two decades, bringing some definitive optimal results. Throughout we try to explain the main proof ideas; Rellich's theorem and Bronshtein's theorem on hyperbolic polynomials are presented with full proofs. The survey is written for readers interested in singularity theory but also for those who intend to apply the results in other fields.</description>

      <title>Operations on transcendental non-Archimedean metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the basic pluripotential-theoretic operations in terms of the transcendental theory of non-Archimedean metrics introduced in \cite{DXZ23}. In particular, we establish that the analogue of Boucksom--Jonsson's envelope conjecture holds in our theory.</description>

      <title>$N=(2,2)$ superfields and geometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one) in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>
