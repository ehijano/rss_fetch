      <title>On Affine Version of Hom-Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Hom-type analogues of affine algebraic structures, termed Hom-affgebras. Extending Brzezi\'nski's theory of affgebras and the Hom-algebra framework developed by Hartwig--Larsson--Silvestrov, we define and study Hom-associative, Hom-pre-Lie, and Hom-Lie affgebras, where the classical identities are twisted by an affine self-map. We show how Hom-associative, Hom-pre-Lie, and Hom-Lie affgebras are related to one another. The main focus of this paper is on Hom-Lie affgebras and their fibers. We study the concept of generalized derivations for Hom-Lie algebras, extending the notion of generalized derivations for Lie algebras. We explore the close relationship between Hom-Lie affgebras and such derivations. We show that every Hom-Lie affgebra both determines and is determined by a Hom-Lie algebra together with such a generalized derivation and a constant. Furthermore, we establish that a homomorphism between Lie affgebras corresponds to a homomorphism between their associated Lie fibers along with a constant, and vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the famous theorem of Albert's on the cyclicity of tensor products of cyclic $p$-algebras. In the case of tensor products of cyclic $p$-algebras of prime degree, we provide an explicit computation of the resulting cyclic algebra in symbol algebra terms.</description>

      <title>A Homological Proof of $\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}$: Computational Topology via Categorical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the separation of complexity classes $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{NP}$ through a novel homological algebraic approach grounded in category theory. We construct the computational category $\mathbf{Comp}$, embedding computational problems and reductions into a unified categorical framework. By developing computational homology theory, we associate to each problem $L$ a chain complex $C_{\bullet}(L)$ whose homology groups $H_n(L)$ capture topological invariants of computational processes. Our main result demonstrates that problems in $\mathbf{P}$ exhibit trivial computational homology ($H_n(L) = 0$ for all $n &gt; 0$), while $\mathbf{NP}$-complete problems such as SAT possess non-trivial homology ($H_1(\mathrm{SAT}) \neq 0$). This homological distinction provides the first rigorous proof of $\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}$ using topological methods. The proof is formally verified in Lean 4, ensuring absolute mathematical rigor. Our work inaugurates computational topology as a new paradigm for complexity analysis, offering finer distinctions than traditional combinatorial approaches and establishing connections between structural complexity theory and homological invariants.</description>

      <title>A unit theorem for products of groups with several ends and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his $1994$ survey, Kleinert defined formally and formulated the problem to obtain unit theorems for unit groups of orders in a semisimple algebra $A$. If $A$ is a group algebra $FG$, it boils down to classifying all finite groups $G$ such that the unit groups of most orders in $FG$ belong to a prescribed class $\mathcal{G}$ of infinite groups. We solve this problem for $\mathcal{G}$ consisting of the groups which are virtually a direct product of groups whose Cayley graph has more than one end. Subsequently, we obtain two types of applications. A first type being about the existence of torsion-free normal complements and a second about obtaining short and uniform proofs of some of the main results in [13,18,14,15].</description>

      <title>Eventually periodic resolutions for groups of type $\textbf{VFP}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules of type $\textbf{FP}_{\infty}$ over the integral group rings of $\Gamma = G / (c)$ of type $\textbf{VFP}$, with $G$ of type $\textbf{FP}$ and $c$ a central element. Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilizes a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</description>

      <title>Generalized prelie and permutative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalizations of pre-Lie algebras, where the free objects are based on rooted trees which edges are typed, instead of usual rooted trees, and with generalized pre-Lie products formed by graftings. Working with a discrete set of types, we show how to obtain such objects when this set is given an associative commutative product and a second product making it a commutative extended semigroup. Working with a vector space of types, these two products are replaced by a bilinear map $\Phi$ which satisfies a braid equation and a commutation relation. Examples of such structures are defined on sets, semigroups, or groups. These constructions define a family of operads PreLie $\Phi$ which generalize the operad of pre-Lie algebras PreLie. For any embedding from PreLie into PreLie $\phi$ , we construct a family of pairs of cointeracting bialgebras, based on typed and decorated trees: the first coproduct is given by an extraction and contraction process, the types being modified by the action of $\Phi$; the second coproduct is given by admissible cuts, in the Connes and Kreimer's way, with again types modified by the action of $\Phi$. We also study the Koszul dual of PreLie $\Phi$ , which gives generalizations of permutative algebras.</description>

      <title>On extended associative semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extended associative semigroups (briefly, EAS), an algebraic structure used to define generalizations of the operad of associative algebras, and the subclass of commutative extended diassociative semigroups (briefly, CEDS), which are used to define generalizations of the operad of pre-Lie algebras. We give families of examples based on semigroups or on groups, as well as a classification of EAS of cardinality two. We then define linear extended associative semigroups as linear maps satisfying a variation of the braid equation. We explore links between linear EAS and bialgebras and Hopf algebras. We also study the structure of nondegenerate finite CEDS and show that they are obtained by semidirect and direct products involving two groups.</description>

      <title>Transposed Poisson Structures on Two Nambu 3-Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the $\frac{1}{3}$-derivations and transposed Poisson structures of the Nambu 3-Lie algebras $A_\omega^\delta $ and $ A_{f,k} $. Specifically, we first present that $A_\omega^\delta $ is finitely generated and graded. Then we find that $A_\omega^\delta $ has non-trivial $\frac{1}{3}$-derivations and admits only trivial transposed Poisson structures. The 3-Lie algebra $A_{f,k}$ admits non-trivial transposed Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>On the cabling of non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the cabling method by Lebed, Ram\'irez and Vendramin from involutive to bijective non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation by working in the Yang--Baxter monoid $M(X,r)$ rather than the group $G(X,r)$. This shift in approach overcomes the obstruction that, for non-involutive solutions, the canonical map from $X$ to the Yang--Baxter group $G(X,r)$ need not be injective and yields a well-defined cabling. We prove that cabling is functorial on biquandles and that the diagonal map transforms as $q\mapsto q^k$. We also show that decomposability is preserved by injectivization and by passing to the associated biquandle, allowing us to work within that class without loss of generality. This leads to criteria for (in)decomposability. As an application, we obtain that square-free solutions with nilpotent derived monoid are decomposable.</description>
