      <title>Objective comparison of auditory profiles using manifold learning and intrinsic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assigning individuals with hearing impairment to auditory profiles can support a better understanding of the causes and consequences of hearing loss and facilitate profile-based hearing-aid fitting. However, the factors influencing auditory profile generation remain insufficiently understood, and existing profiling frameworks have rarely been compared systematically. This study therefore investigated the impact of two key factors - the clustering method and the number of profiles - on auditory profile generation. In addition, eight established auditory profiling frameworks were systematically reviewed and compared using intrinsic statistical measures and manifold learning techniques. Frameworks were evaluated with respect to internal consistency (i.e., grouping similar individuals) and cluster separation (i.e., clear differentiation between groups). To ensure comparability, all analyses were conducted on a common open-access dataset, the extended Oldenburg Hearing Health Record (OHHR), comprising 1,127 participants (mean age = 67.2 years, SD = 12.0). Results showed that both the clustering method and the chosen number of profiles substantially influenced the resulting auditory profiles. Among purely audiogram-based approaches, the Bisgaard auditory profiles demonstrated the strongest clustering performance, whereas audiometric phenotypes performed worst. Among frameworks incorporating supra-threshold information in addition to the audiogram, the Hearing4All auditory profiles were advantageous, combining a near-optimal number of profile classes (N = 13) with high clustering quality, as indicated by a low Davies-Bouldin index. In conclusion, manifold learning and intrinsic measures enable systematic comparison of auditory profiling frameworks and identify the Hearing4All auditory profile as a promising approach for future research.</description>

      <title>Fine and Hyperfine Interactions with Multi-level Spin Relaxation of the purified Giese-Salt in Veterinary Medicine: Prussian Blue Compound Ammonium-Ferric-Hexacyano-Ferrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ammonium ferric hexacyanoferrate is a veterinary-medical milestone and antidote against radiocesium, well-known as Giese-salt after the Chernobyl disaster fed to domestic and wild animals, which shows even a rich interplay of properties in nanostructural chemistry and ferromagnetism. Among the broad analytical techniques, the ambivalence of macroscopic micrometer-sized agglomerates and nanoparticle sizes, a suggested enlarged Fe(II)$-$C$\equiv$N$-$Fe(III) bond length by Fe K-edge XAFS results and multi-level spin relaxation in $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy are highlighted. This sets this underestimated compound in a new light, e.g., for modern biomedicine and biofunctionality, extending its essential importance in addition to hypothetical future nuclear incidents</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations using a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer reveal significant beam distortion of 7.8 mm attributed to the skull's heterogeneous acoustical properties.</description>
