      <title>Single-Switch Transformer-less Power Supply for Low Temperature Plasma Jet -- 3.3 kV SiC MOSFET opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a simple power converter, without any high voltage transformer, able to supply and control a plasma jet based on dielectric barrier discharge. The converter, operating in pulsed current mode, requires a single power switch and is fed by a low voltage DC source. It can deliver very short duration pulses to the plasma jet with high current amplitude. The operating principle is explained by means of the state plane analysis and is validated with simulations and experimental results. The equations provided allow for the calculation during the design stage of important characteristics of the plasma jet as the peak voltage and the duration of the pulses. The power can be easily adjusted during experimentation to comply with the desired appearance of the plasma jet.</description>

      <title>Novel Signatures of Radiation Reaction in Electron-Laser Sidescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate novel signatures of radiation reaction via the angular deflection of an electron beam colliding at 90 degrees with an intense laser pulse. Due to the radiation reaction effect, the electrons can be deflected towards the beam axis for plane wave backgrounds, which is not possible in the absence of radiation reaction effects. The magnitude and size of the deflection angle can be controlled by tailoring the laser pulse shapes. The effect is first derived analytically using the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which allows to determine the important scaling behavior with laser intensity and particle energy. We then move on to full scale 3D Monte Carlo simulations to verify the effect is observable with present day laser technology. We investigate the opportunities for an indirect observation of laser depletion in such side scattering scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ion Kinetics and Neutron Generation Associated with Electromagnetic Turbulence in Laboratory-scale Counter-streaming Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic turbulence and ion kinetics in counter-streaming plasmas hold great significance in laboratory astrophysics, such as turbulence field amplification and particle energization. Here, we quantitatively demonstrate for the first time how electromagnetic turbulence affects ion kinetics under achievable laboratory conditions (millimeter-scale interpenetrating plasmas with initial velocity of $2000\ \mathrm{km/s}$, density of $4 \times 10^{19}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, and temperature of $100\ \mathrm{eV}$) utilizing a recently developed high-order implicit particle-in-cell code without scaling transformation. It is found that the electromagnetic turbulence is driven by ion two-stream and filamentation instabilities. For the magnetized scenarios where an applied magnetic field of tens of Tesla is perpendicular to plasma flows, the growth rates of instabilities increase with the strengthening of applied magnetic field, which therefore leads to a significant enhancement of turbulence fields. Under the competition between the stochastic acceleration due to electromagnetic turbulence and collisional thermalization, ion distribution function shows a distinct super-Gaussian shape, and the ion kinetics are manifested in neutron yields and spectra. Our results have well explained the recent unmagnetized experimental observations, and the findings of magnetized scenario can be verified by current astrophysical experiments.</description>

      <title>Algebraic discrete quantum harmonic oscillator with dynamic resolution scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic formulation for the discrete quantum harmonic oscillator (DQHO) with a finite, equally-spaced energy spectrum and energy eigenfunctions defined on a discrete domain, which is known as the su(2) or Kravchuk oscillator. Unlike previous approaches, ours does not depend on the discretization of the Schr\"odinger equation and recurrence relations of special functions. This algebraic formulation is endowed with a natural su(2) algebra, each finite dimensional irreducible representation of which defines a distinct DQHO labeled by its resolution. In addition to energy ladder operators, the formulation allows for resolution ladder operators connecting all DQHOs with different resolutions. The resolution ladder operators thus enable the dynamic scaling of the resolution of finite degree-of-freedom quantum simulations. Using the algebraic DQHO formalism, we are able to rigorously derive the energy eigenstate wave functions of the QHO in a purely algebraic manner without using differential equations or differential operators, which is impossible in the continuous or infinite discrete setting. The coherent state of the DQHO is constructed, and its expected position is proven to oscillate as a classical harmonic oscillator. The DQHO coherent state recovers that of the quantum harmonic oscillator at large resolution. The algebraic formulation also predicts the existence of an inverse DQHO that has no known continuous counterpart.</description>
