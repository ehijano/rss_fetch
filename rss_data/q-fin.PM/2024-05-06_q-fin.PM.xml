      <title>Predictive Decision Synthesis for Portfolios: Betting on Better Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss and develop Bayesian dynamic modelling and predictive decision synthesis for portfolio analysis. The context involves model uncertainty with a set of candidate models for financial time series with main foci in sequential learning, forecasting, and recursive decisions for portfolio reinvestments. The foundational perspective of Bayesian predictive decision synthesis (BPDS) defines novel, operational analysis and resulting predictive and decision outcomes. A detailed case study of BPDS in financial forecasting of international exchange rate time series and portfolio rebalancing, with resulting BPDS-based decision outcomes compared to traditional Bayesian analysis, exemplifies and highlights the practical advances achievable under the expanded, subjective Bayesian approach that BPDS defines.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading or Financial robots have been conquering the stock markets with their ability to fathom complex statistical trading strategies. But with the recent development of deep learning technologies, these strategies are becoming impotent. The DQN and A2C models have previously outperformed eminent humans in game-playing and robotics. In our work, we propose a reinforced portfolio manager offering assistance in the allocation of weights to assets. The environment proffers the manager the freedom to go long and even short on the assets. The weight allocation advisements are restricted to the choice of portfolio assets and tested empirically to knock benchmark indices. The manager performs financial transactions in a postulated liquid market without any transaction charges. This work provides the conclusion that the proposed portfolio manager with actions centered on weight allocations can surpass the risk-adjusted returns of conventional portfolio managers.</description>
