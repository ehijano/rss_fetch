      <title>Obstructions to return preservation for episturmian morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies obstructions to preservation of return sets by episturmian morphisms. We show, by way of an explicit construction, that infinitely many obstructions exist. This generalizes and improves an earlier result about Sturmian morphisms.</description>

      <title>Radio number for the Cartesian product of a tree and a complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A radio labelling of a graph $G$ is a mapping $f : V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2,\ldots\}$ such that $|f(u)-f(v)|\geq diam(G) + 1 - d(u,v)$ for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v$ of $G$, where $diam(G)$ is the diameter of $G$ and $d(u,v)$ is the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. The radio number $rn(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a radio labelling $f$ with $\max\{f(v):v \in V(G)\} = k$. In this paper, we give a lower bound for the radio number of the Cartesian product of a tree and a complete graph and give two necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the lower bound. We also give three sufficient conditions to achieve the lower bound. We determine the radio number for the Cartesian product of a level-wise regular trees and a complete graph which attains the lower bound. The radio number for the Cartesian product of a path and a complete graph derived in [Radio number for the product of a path and a complete graph, J. Comb. Optim., 30 (2015), 139-149] can be obtained using our results in a short way.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of relaxed $k$-ary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relaxed $k$-ary tree is an ordered directed acyclic graph with a unique source and sink in which every node has out-degree $k$. These objects arise in the compression of trees in which some repeated subtrees are factored and repeated appearances are replaced by pointers. We prove an asymptotic theta-result for the number of relaxed $k$-ary tree with $n$ nodes for $n \to \infty$. This generalizes the previously proved binary case to arbitrary finite arity, and shows that the seldom observed phenomenon of a stretched exponential term $e^{c n^{1/3}}$ appears in all these cases. We also derive the recurrences for compacted $k$-ary trees in which all subtrees are unique and minimal deterministic finite automata accepting a finite language over a finite alphabet.</description>

      <title>Approximating the volume of a truncated relaxation of the independence polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answering a question of Gamarnik and Smedira, we give a polynomial time algorithm that approximately computes the volume of a truncation of a relaxation of the independent set polytope, improving on their quasi-polynomial time algorithm. Our algorithm is obtained by viewing the volume as an evaluation of a graph polynomial and we approximate this evaluation using Barvinok's interpolation method.</description>

      <title>Box Facets and Cut Facets of Lifted Multicut Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifted multicut problem is a combinatorial optimization problem whose feasible solutions relate one-to-one to the decompositions of a graph $G = (V, E)$. Given an augmentation $\widehat{G} = (V, E \cup F)$ of $G$ and given costs $c \in \mathbb{R}^{E \cup F}$, the objective is to minimize the sum of those $c_{uw}$ with $uw \in E \cup F$ for which $u$ and $w$ are in distinct components. For $F = \emptyset$, the problem specializes to the multicut problem, and for $E = \tbinom{V}{2}$ to the clique partitioning problem. We study a binary linear program formulation of the lifted multicut problem. More specifically, we contribute to the analysis of the associated lifted multicut polytopes: Firstly, we establish a necessary, sufficient and efficiently decidable condition for a lower box inequality to define a facet. Secondly, we show that deciding whether a cut inequality of the binary linear program defines a facet is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Counting Subgraphs in Somewhere Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problems of counting copies and induced copies of a small pattern graph $H$ in a large host graph $G$. Recent work fully classified the complexity of those problems according to structural restrictions on the patterns $H$. In this work, we address the more challenging task of analysing the complexity for restricted patterns and restricted hosts. Specifically we ask which families of allowed patterns and hosts imply fixed-parameter tractability, i.e., the existence of an algorithm running in time $f(H)\cdot |G|^{O(1)}$ for some computable function $f$. Our main results present exhaustive and explicit complexity classifications for families that satisfy natural closure properties. Among others, we identify the problems of counting small matchings and independent sets in subgraph-closed graph classes $\mathcal{G}$ as our central objects of study and establish the following crisp dichotomies as consequences of the Exponential Time Hypothesis: (1) Counting $k$-matchings in a graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. (2) Counting $k$-independent sets in a graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. Moreover, we obtain almost tight conditional lower bounds if $\mathcal{G}$ is somewhere dense, i.e., not nowhere dense. These base cases of our classifications subsume a wide variety of previous results on the matching and independent set problem, such as counting $k$-matchings in bipartite graphs (Curticapean, Marx; FOCS 14), in $F$-colourable graphs (Roth, Wellnitz; SODA 20), and in degenerate graphs (Bressan, Roth; FOCS 21), as well as counting $k$-independent sets in bipartite graphs (Curticapean et al.; Algorithmica 19).</description>

      <title>Hardness of circuit and monotone diameters of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>Poset Positional Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of positional games, supplementing them with a restriction on the order in which the elements of the board are allowed to be claimed. We introduce poset positional games, which are positional games with an additional structure -- a poset on the elements of the board. Throughout the game play, based on this poset and the set of the board elements that are claimed up to that point, we reduce the set of available moves for the player whose turn it is -- an element of the board can only be claimed if all the smaller elements in the poset are already claimed.
  We proceed to analyse these games in more detail, with a prime focus on the most studied convention, the Maker-Breaker games. First we build a general framework around poset positional games. Then, we perform a comprehensive study of the complexity of determining the game outcome, conditioned on the structure of the family of winning sets on the one side and the structure of the poset on the other.</description>
