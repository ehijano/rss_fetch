      <title>Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy in superconducting phases coexisting with pair-, charge- and spin-density-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recent observations of spatial oscillations in the energy position of the superconducting coherence peaks in the cuprate, transition metal dichalcogenide, iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors are consistent with the possible presence of a pair-, charge- or spin-density-wave phase. We show that for all three cases, the spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter, $\Delta({\bf r})$ can be imaged via the critical Josephson current, $I_c({\bf r})$ measured in Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments. Finally, we show that the spatial oscillations of the density waves and of $\Delta({\bf r})$ exhibit relative phase shifts of $\Delta \phi = 0$ or $\pi$ for a charge-density wave, and $\Delta \phi =\pi/2$ for the spin-density wave.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference of Ginzburg--Landau Parameters in Type--1.5 Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring microscopic couplings in multi-component superconductors directly from vortex configurations is a challenging inverse problem. In Type-1.5 systems, Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) dynamics generate complex, glassy vortex patterns with high metastability. We explicitly quantify this intractability by analyzing the Hessian spectrum of the energy landscape, revealing a proliferation of soft modes that hinders traditional sampling. We address this challenge by combining a differentiable TDGL solver with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). Our approach treats the solver as a stochastic forward model mapping physical parameters ({\theta} = ({\eta}, B, {\nu})) to vortex density fields. Using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE), we train a classifier to approximate the likelihood-to-evidence ratio and perform Bayesian inference for the interband Josephson coupling from vortex density fields. On synthetic data, the proposed method reliably recovers the coupling with calibrated uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Translational symmetry breaking in the electronic nematic phase of BaFe2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of the nematicity, namely, four-fold rotational symmetry breaking in iron-based superconductors has been controversial since its discovery. In particular, its relationship with the stripe-type spin-density-wave order and the orthorhombic lattice distortion in the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic (AFO) phase, which exists at temperatures below the electronic nematic phase, has been highly debated. Here, we report on the temperature evolution of angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the parent compound BaFe2As2, ranging from the AFO to nematic to paramagnetic phases. The Dirac cone feature, which is formed in the AFO phase, is found to persist in the nematic phase, suggesting that an antiferroic order of the same periodicity as the AFO phase persists in the nematic phase. Considering the relatively shallow d_xy orbital in BaFe2As2, we propose that an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy and other orbitals takes place in the nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and Tunable Superconducting Diode Effect in Quantum Spin Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal dissipationless transport has long been sought for applications in superconducting technologies. Recently, it has been implemented by the so called superconducting diode effect. Such effect arises from an imbalance in critical supercurrents flowing in opposite directions. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how the superconducting diode effect emerges in the quantum spin Hall phase when brought into full proximity with a superconductor. We explore two regimes: large and narrow quantum wells. In the former geometry, we show that the superconducting diode effect can be externally controlled using both magnetic and electric fields, achieving unit efficiency. In the latter regime, where tunneling between opposite edges may occur, we propose a mechanism for an intrinsic superconducting diode effect driven by edge reconstruction, which does not require external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Higgs physics in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As pointed out by Nambu-Goldstone, continuous symmetry breaking gives rise to gapless bosonic excitation. In superconductors, continuous local U(1) gauge symmetry is broken. The gapless excitation thus created is the collective phase mode of a superconductor. In 1962, Anderson pointed out that Coulomb interaction lifts this gapless mode to the superconducting plasma frequency. Therefore, in a superconducting fluid there are no bosonic excitations below the Cooper pair binding energy. Anderson mechanism also implies that the massless photon becomes massive in a superconductor. It provides a microscopic theory for dissipationless charge transport (with Landau criterion for superfluidity) and the Meissner effect in a superconductor. Jumping to particle physics, to explain why the gauge bosons for electroweak interaction are massive, Higgs, Englert, Kibble et al. proposed the existence of the Higgs field. This matter field couples to the massless W, Z bosons and generates mass via the Higgs mechanism. Due to their conceptual similarities, these two mechanisms are referred to as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. In 2013, the detection of the Higgs boson provided the final proof for the Higgs hypothesis decades after its conception. The amplitude mode of a superconductor, which corresponds to the Higgs boson in the above analogy, is referred to as the Higgs mode. Its spectroscopic detection has also remained elusive for decades. In recent years, the development of ultrafast techniques enabled an effective approach for studying the mode. Here, we introduce the Higgs mode from a perspective of why superconductors superconduct and review the recent development in Higgs spectroscopy, particularly in the field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the novel insights that may be learnt from these studies for future high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials research in general.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive non-reciprocal transport in high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in a planar s-wave/d-wave/s-wave Josephson junction as a direct phase-sensitive probe of the d-wave pairing function in high-Tc superconductors. Asymmetric interface coupling breaks inversion symmetry and induces a spontaneous Pi/2 phase difference, thereby breaking time-reversal symmetry without a magnetic field. In this TRS-broken state, the SDE emerges when single-Cooper-pair tunneling is enabled at the s-d interfaces, with its polarity and efficiency controllable by rotating the d-wave crystallographic orientation or perturbing its intrinsic C4 symmetry. Our results reveal a robust link between nonreciprocal Josephson transport and pairing symmetry, establishing the SDE as a powerful diagnostic tool for high-Tc superconductors and a tunable element for superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Second-Order Topological Superconductors with Tunable Majorana Zero Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals, with their protected Dirac points, present an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal. In the normal state near half-filling, the Fermi surface consists of two distinct pockets, each enclosing a Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum ($\textbf{X}=(\pi,0)$ and $\textbf{Y}=(0,\pi)$). Considering an on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interaction, we use self-consistent mean-field theory to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry. We find that an even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is favored as it gives rise to a fully gapped superconducting state. Since the pairing amplitude has opposite signs on the two Dirac Fermi pockets, the superconducting state is identified as a second-order topological superconductor. The hallmark of this topological phase is the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries. Notably, the positions of these Majorana modes are highly controllable and can be manipulated simply by tailoring the boundary sublattice terminations. Our results highlight the promise of nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous metallic phase and reduced critical current in superconducting nanowires due to inverse proximity effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-to-metal transitions (SMTs) are key probes of mesoscopic superconductivity, but their interpretation can be complicated by device geometry and measurement conditions. Here, we study epitaxial InAs-Al nanowires and show that metallic contacts induce an inverse proximity effect (IPE), creating weak spots in the superconductor that strongly suppress the critical current and give rise to an anomalous metallic phase. Using transport measurements supported by Usadel theory, we demonstrate that this phase originates from the contact-induced weakening of superconductivity together with Joule heating, rather than intrinsic material properties. Our findings reveal an overlooked observer effect in mesoscopic superconductors and provide essential guidance for interpreting SMTs and for designing devices based on these systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic Nature of Spinel Oxides: A Review of Their Electron Interactions and Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review discusses the multifaceted electronic properties of spinel oxides with a particular focus on Lithium Vanadate (LiV2O4), Lithium Titanate (LiTi2O4), and Magnesium Titanate (MgTi2O4). We selected LiTi2O4, LiV2O4, and MgTi2O4 because they serve as quintessential examples of spinel oxides' diverse and intriguing electronic phenomena. LiV2O4 heavy fermion behaviour challenges traditional theories in d-electron systems, LiTi2O4 being the first oxide superconductor provides critical insights into unconventional superconductivity driven by strong electron-phonon interactions, and MgTi2O4 pronounced orbital ordering and metalinsulator transition offers a clear model for exploring electron-lattice coupling. This shows how the inherent structural versatility of the spinel lattice, characterised by its cubic close-packed oxygen network and variable cation distributions, enables a rich interplay of electron-electron correlations, electron-lattice coupling, and orbital degrees of freedom. In LiV2O4, the combination of mixed-valence vanadium ions and a geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice gives rise to heavy fermion behaviour, whereas LiTi2O4 exhibits unconventional superconductivity driven by a high density of states at the Fermi level and strong electronphonon interactions. MgTi2O4 undergoes a pronounced metal-insulator transition, where orbital ordering triggers a Peierls-like distortion that stabilises a low-temperature insulating state through Ti-Ti dimerization. How the composition of these compounds affects their properties, based on both theoretical research and experimental findings, is illustrated by this review. It illustrates the promise of Spinels in practical technologies such as energy storage, electrocatalysis, and high-temperature lubrication.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity near an Ising nematic quantum critical point in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near a two-dimensional Ising-type nematic quantum critical point, the quantum fluctuations of the nematic order parameter are coupled to the electrons, leading to non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between these two effects has been extensively studied through the Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap. However, previous studies often rely on various approximations that may introduce uncertainties in the results. Here, we re-visit the issue of how the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$ is affected by removing certain common approximations. We numerically solve the self-consistent Dyson-Schwinger equations of the electron propagator $G(p)$, the nematic propagator $D(q)$, and the vertex function $\Gamma_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{1L}}(p+q,p)$ expanded up to the triangle order, without introducing further approximations. Our calculations reveal that the extended $s$-wave superconducting gap is the only convergent solution to the nonlinear gap equations. We investigate the evolution of $T_{c}$ as the system approaches the nematic quantum critical point from the disordered (tetragonal) phase. Under the bare vertex approximation, $T_{c}$ is monotonically enhanced. However, when vertex corrections are incorporated, $T_{c}$ initially increases but then decreases, with the maximum value of $T_{c}$ occurring at a point away from the quantum critical point. The obtained gap symmetry and the non-monotonic behavior of $T_{c}$ are compared with recent experiments on doped FeSe materials.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bifurcation and Anomalous Supercurrent in Dissipative Topological Insulator-based Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between topological protection and dissipation constitutes a critical frontier in the realization of hybrid quantum devices. Here, we investigate the transport signatures in a dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junction, a platform that directly probes the competition between quantum coherence and loss. We model dissipation by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead to the junction, described effectively by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived using the Lindblad formalism. We observe that the junction exhibits an asymmetric complex Andreev spectrum, where the imaginary energy component imposes a finite lifetime on the quasi-bound states. Furthermore, beyond specific phase intervals, the real component of the spectrum bifurcates: one branch merges with the continuum, while the other penetrates just below the superconducting gap. Crucially, the characteristic zero-energy crossing shifts away from $\phi=\pi$ and acquires a non-zero imaginary component; consequently, the associated Majorana bound states acquire a finite lifetime, signaling a loss of robustness against dissipation. Finally, this spectral asymmetry drives an anomalous supercurrent, manifested as a non-vanishing current at zero phase difference. Our results reveal how dissipation fundamentally reshapes superconducting transport in topological junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Current-Induced Zero-Resistance State in Valley-Polarized Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed nonreciprocal current-induced zero-resistance state (CIZRS) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure has posed a significant theoretical challenge. In the experiment, the system shows a zero-resistance state only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular direction, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small resistance when the current is small or flows in the opposite direction. In this Letter, we provide a theory of CIZRS. We show that the threefold degenerate Fulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized by the valley polarization and trigonal warping effects of twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Moreover, a current flowing in a particular direction breaks the threefold degeneracy and favors a particular FF pairing domain. We therefore propose that the incipient superconducting state is naturally understood as a multidomain state where the interdomain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson coupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta between different FF domains. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a certain FF state and create monodomain pathways with zero resistance. Crucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in the opposite direction can fail to generate the zero-resistance pathways, thus giving rise to the observed nonreciprocity. Finally, we suggest that the long-sought-after triangular finite-momentum state can also be realized in valley-polarized superconductors.</description>
