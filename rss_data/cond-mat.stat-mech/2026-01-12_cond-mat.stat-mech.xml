      <title>Autonomous Discovery of the Ising Model's Critical Parameters with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for determining critical parameters are often influenced by human factors. This research introduces a physics-inspired adaptive reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to autonomously interact with physical environments, simultaneously identifying both the critical temperature and various types of critical exponents in the Ising model with precision. Interestingly, our algorithm exhibits search behavior reminiscent of phase transitions, efficiently converging to target parameters regardless of initial conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms traditional approaches, particularly in environments with strong perturbations. This study not only incorporates physical concepts into machine learning to enhance algorithm interpretability but also establishes a new paradigm for scientific exploration, transitioning from manual analysis to autonomous AI discovery.</description>

      <title>Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.</description>

      <title>Exact Volterra series for mean field dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact Volterra series expansion for a mean field of an interacting particle system subject to a potential perturbation, expressing the Volterra expansion kernels in terms of the field's response functions, to any order. Applying this formalism to the mean particle density of a simple fluid, we identify a form reminiscent of dynamical density functional theory, with, however, fundamental differences: A nonlocal mobility kernel appears, and forces derive from a functional of the {\it history} of mean density. The equilibrium density functional is shown to be recovered in the limit of slowly varying perturbation. We identify a freedom in deriving this expansion, which allows different forms of mobility kernels. These developments allow for a systematic improvement of established mean field formalisms.</description>

      <title>Slow mixing and emergent one-form symmetries in three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking order at low temperatures is often accompanied by slow relaxation dynamics, due to diverging free-energy barriers arising from interfaces between different ordered states. Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\text{mix}} = \exp [\Omega(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-controlled thermal activation in pyramidal Coulomb clusters: Testing Kramers-Langer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-cooled ions confined in electromagnetic traps provide a unique, tunable mesoscopic system where the interplay of the trapping potential, nonlinear Coulomb interactions, and laser-ion scattering generates rich, collective dynamics. In this work, we engineer thermally activated switching between two oppositely oriented, square-pyramidal configurations of five laser-cooled ions in a Paul trap. For identical ions ($^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), the inversions proceed via a \textit{Berry pseudo-rotation} mechanism with a low activation barrier, enabled by the permutation symmetry, in contrast to the \textit{umbrella inversion} observed in ammonia. The experimentally measured inversion rates, spanning two orders of magnitude, are accurately captured by the multidimensional Kramers-Langer theory, enabling thermometry of the Doppler-cooled ion cluster at $1.8 \pm 0.1$ mK. By substituting the apex ion with a heavier isotope ($^{44}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), we break the permutation symmetry and observe a suppression of thermally activated inversions. Numerical analysis reveals that this symmetry breaking closes the low-barrier channel, forcing the system to invert through a high-barrier \textit{turnstile rotation}. Thus, we demonstrate a structural analogue of molecular kinetic isotope effects, establishing trapped ions as a versatile platform to explore symmetry-controlled collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the 2nd Law in an Exactly Solvable Model of a Quantum Wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.</description>

      <title>Chaos, thermalization and breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence in a collective many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermalization and the quantum-classical correspondence in the fully-connected Bose-Hubbard model, focusing on the four-site case. Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles. Our results reveal unexpectedly slow convergence to the classical limit, signaling robust finite-size effects in collective many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning microstructure in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding microstructure in terms of closed-form expressions is an open challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics. We propose a simple and generic method that combines particle-resolved simulations, deep neural networks and symbolic regression to predict the pair-correlation function of passive and active particles. Our analytical closed-form results closely agree with Brownian dynamics simulations, even at relatively large packing fractions and for strong activity. The proposed method is broadly applicable, computationally efficient, and can be used to enhance the predictive power of nonequilibrium continuum theories and for designing pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Particles, trajectories and diffusion: random walks in cooling granular gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and crtical exponents in the six-vertex model on kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the experimental realization of direct kagome spin ice [Yue et al., Nat. Nanotechnol. 19, 1101 (2024)], the theoretical six-vertex model on the kagome lattice is systematically simulated using the directed loop Monte Carlo method. Four distinct vortex lattice phases are identified: (i) antiferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both triangular and honeycomb faces, with a winding number $k=1$. (ii) ferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both types of faces, with $k=-2$ on the honeycomb faces and $k=1$ on the triangular faces. (iii) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the triangular faces with $k=1$; and (iv) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the honeycomb faces with $k=1$. As for ferromagnetic to different types of paramagnetic phase, besides the Ising universality class with $y_t=1$, varying critical exponents have also been found with different values of vertex weights. The transition between the third type and fourth type of vortex lattice phases occurs with the new exponent $y_t=1.340(3)$. The third and fourth types of the vortex lattice phase to the vortex disorder phase are found to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. These findings contribute to the search for and understanding of ice on complex lattices.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics and first-passage times in quantum Markovian processes: Ensemble relations, metastability, and fluctuation theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing fluctuations in quantum transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics using two complementary approaches: full counting statistics and first-passage times. Focusing on open quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting circuits, and nanoscale heat engines.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>

Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11093</link>

Abstract: Critical phenomena have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in many fields, such as condensed matter physics, biology, e.g., brain criticality, and cosmology. In particular, the behaviour of response functions right at critical points (CPs) is highly topical. It turns out that in the frame of Boltzmann-Gibbs-von Neumann-Shannon approach, the extensive character of entropy breaks down at CPs. The latter implies diverging susceptibilities, which is at odds with experimental observations. Here, we investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ right at CPs for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i}$) for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii}$) the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii}$) the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv}$) we propose an experimental setup to explore finite-size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ and $S_q$.</description>
