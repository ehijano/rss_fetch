      <title>PhysAnimator: Physics-Guided Generative Cartoon Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating hand-drawn animation sequences is labor-intensive and demands professional expertise. We introduce PhysAnimator, a novel approach for generating physically plausible meanwhile anime-stylized animation from static anime illustrations. Our method seamlessly integrates physics-based simulations with data-driven generative models to produce dynamic and visually compelling animations. To capture the fluidity and exaggeration characteristic of anime, we perform image-space deformable body simulations on extracted mesh geometries. We enhance artistic control by introducing customizable energy strokes and incorporating rigging point support, enabling the creation of tailored animation effects such as wind interactions. Finally, we extract and warp sketches from the simulation sequence, generating a texture-agnostic representation, and employ a sketch-guided video diffusion model to synthesize high-quality animation frames. The resulting animations exhibit temporal consistency and visual plausibility, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating dynamic anime-style animations.</description>

      <title>FlexMotion: Lightweight, Physics-Aware, and Controllable Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight, controllable, and physically plausible human motion synthesis is crucial for animation, virtual reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction applications. Existing methods often compromise between computational efficiency, physical realism, or spatial controllability. We propose FlexMotion, a novel framework that leverages a computationally lightweight diffusion model operating in the latent space, eliminating the need for physics simulators and enabling fast and efficient training. FlexMotion employs a multimodal pre-trained Transformer encoder-decoder, integrating joint locations, contact forces, joint actuations and muscle activations to ensure the physical plausibility of the generated motions. FlexMotion also introduces a plug-and-play module, which adds spatial controllability over a range of motion parameters (e.g., joint locations, joint actuations, contact forces, and muscle activations). Our framework achieves realistic motion generation with improved efficiency and control, setting a new benchmark for human motion synthesis. We evaluate FlexMotion on extended datasets and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of realism, physical plausibility, and controllability.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Image Generation for Vocabulary Learning Using the Keyword Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 'keyword method' is an effective technique for learning vocabulary of a foreign language. It involves creating a memorable visual link between what a word means and what its pronunciation in a foreign language sounds like in the learner's native language. However, these memorable visual links remain implicit in the people's mind and are not easy to remember for a large set of words. To enhance the memorisation and recall of the vocabulary, we developed an application that combines the keyword method with text-to-image generators to externalise the memorable visual links into visuals. These visuals represent additional stimuli during the memorisation process. To explore the effectiveness of this approach we first run a pilot study to investigate how difficult it is to externalise the descriptions of mental visualisations of memorable links, by asking participants to write them down. We used these descriptions as prompts for text-to-image generator (DALL-E2) to convert them into images and asked participants to select their favourites. Next, we compared different text-to-image generators (DALL-E2, Midjourney, Stable and Latent Diffusion) to evaluate the perceived quality of the generated images by each. Despite heterogeneous results, participants mostly preferred images generated by DALL-E2, which was used also for the final study. In this study, we investigated whether providing such images enhances the retention of vocabulary being learned, compared to the keyword method only. Our results indicate that people did not encounter difficulties describing their visualisations of memorable links and that providing corresponding images significantly improves memory retention.</description>

      <title>Implicit-Explicit simulation of Mass-Spring-Charge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point masses connected by springs, or mass-spring systems, are widely used in computer animation to approximate the behavior of deformable objects. One of the restrictions imposed by these models is that points that are not topologically constrained (linked by a spring) are unable to interact with each other explicitly. Such interactions would introduce a new dimension for artistic control and animation within the computer graphics community. Beyond graphics, such a model could be an effective proxy to use for model-based learning of complex physical systems such as molecular biology. We propose to imbue masses in a mass-spring system with electrostatic charge leading a system with internal forces between all pairs of charged points -- regardless of whether they are linked by a spring. We provide a practical and stable algorithm to simulate charged mass-spring systems over long time horizons. We demonstrate how these systems may be controlled via parameters such as guidance electric fields or external charges, thus presenting fresh opportunities for artistic authoring. Our method is especially appropriate for computer graphics applications due to its robustness at larger simulation time steps.</description>

      <title>StableMaterials: Enhancing Diversity in Material Generation via Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce StableMaterials, a novel approach for generating photorealistic physical-based rendering (PBR) materials that integrate semi-supervised learning with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Our method employs adversarial training to distill knowledge from existing large-scale image generation models, minimizing the reliance on annotated data and enhancing the diversity in generation. This distillation approach aligns the distribution of the generated materials with that of image textures from an SDXL model, enabling the generation of novel materials that are not present in the initial training dataset. Furthermore, we employ a diffusion-based refiner model to improve the visual quality of the samples and achieve high-resolution generation. Finally, we distill a latent consistency model for fast generation in just four steps and propose a new tileability technique that removes visual artifacts typically associated with fewer diffusion steps. We detail the architecture and training process of StableMaterials, the integration of semi-supervised training within existing LDM frameworks and show the advantages of our approach. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of StableMaterials, highlighting its potential applications in computer graphics and beyond. StableMaterials is publicly available at https://gvecchio.com/stablematerials.</description>

      <title>TinkerXR: In-Situ, Reality-Aware CAD and 3D Printing Interface for Novices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing accessibility of augmented reality (AR) for visualization, existing computer-aided design (CAD) systems remain confined to traditional screens or require complex setups or predefined parameters, limiting immersion and accessibility for novices. We present TinkerXR, an open-sourced interface enabling in-situ design and fabrication through Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling. TinkerXR operates solely with a headset and 3D printer, allowing users to design directly in and for their physical environments. By leveraging spatial awareness, depth occlusion, recognition of physical constraints, reference objects, and intuitive hand movement controls, TinkerXR enhances realism, precision, and ease of use. Its AR-based workflow integrates design and 3D printing with a drag-and-drop interface for a 3D printer's virtual twin. A user study comparing TinkerXR with Tinkercad demonstrates higher accessibility, engagement, and ease of use for novices. By bridging the gap between digital creation and physical output, TinkerXR transforms everyday spaces into accessible and expressive creative studios.</description>
