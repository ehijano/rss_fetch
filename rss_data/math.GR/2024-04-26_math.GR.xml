      <title>The quasi-isometry invariance of the Coset Intersection Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ consisting of a finitely generated group and finite collection of subgroups, we introduce a simplicial $G$-complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ called the coset intersection complex. We prove that the quasi-isometry type and the homotopy type of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ are quasi-isometric invariants of the group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. Classical properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ correspond to topological or geometric properties of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$, such as having finite height, having finite width, being almost malnormal, admiting a malnormal core, or having thickness of order one. As applications, we obtain that a number of algebraic properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ are quasi-isometry invariants of the pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. For a certain class of right-angled Artin groups and their maximal parabolic subgroups, we show that the complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ is quasi-isometric to the Deligne complex; in particular, it is hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>A differentiable monoid of smooth maps on Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.04816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate a monoid of smooth mappings on the space of arrows of a Lie groupoid and its group of units. The group of units turns out to be an infinite-dimensional Lie group which is regular in the sense of Milnor. Furthermore, this group is closely connected to the group of bisections of the Lie groupoid. Under suitable conditions, i.e. the source map of the Lie groupoid is proper, one also obtains a differentiable structure on the monoid and can identify the bisection group as a Lie subgroup of its group of units. Finally, relations between groupoids associated to the underlying Lie groupoid and subgroups of the monoid are obtained. The key tool driving the investigation is a generalisation of a result by A. Stacey which we establish in the present article. This result, called the Stacey-Roberts Lemma, asserts that pushforwards of submersions yield submersions between the infinite-dimensional manifolds of mappings.</description>

      <title>Commensurated hyperbolic subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if H is a non-elementary hyperbolic commensurated subgroup of infinite index in a hyperbolic group G, then H is virtually a free product of hyperbolic surface groups and free groups. We prove that whenever a one-ended hyperbolic group H is a fiber of a non-trivial hyperbolic bundle then H virtually splits over a 2-ended subgroup.</description>

      <title>Zero-sum partitions of Abelian groups and their applications to magic-type labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following problem has been known since the 80s. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group of order $m$ (denoted $|\Gamma|=m$), and let $t$ and $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$, be positive integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^t m_i=m-1$. Determine when $\Gamma^*=\Gamma\setminus\{0\}$, the set of non-zero elements of $\Gamma$, can be partitioned into disjoint subsets $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$ such that $|S_i|=m_i$ and $\sum_{s\in S_i}s=0$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$. Such a subset partition is called a \textit{zero-sum partition}.
  $|I(\Gamma)|\neq 1$, where $I(\Gamma)$ is the set of involutions in $\Gamma$, is a necessary condition for the existence of zero-sum partitions. In this paper, we show that the additional condition of $m_i\geq 4$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$, is sufficient. Moreover, we present some applications of zero-sum partitions to magic-type labelings of graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Balancing Allocations and Factor Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we show that every stationary random measure on $\mathbb R^d$ that is essentially free (i.e., has no symmetries a.s.) admits a point process as a factor (i.e., as a measurable and translation-equivariant function of the measure). As a result, we improve the results of Last and Thorisson (2022) on the existence of a factor balancing allocation between ergodic pairs of stationary random measures $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ with equal intensities. In particular, we prove that such an allocation exists if $\Phi$ is diffuse and either $(\Phi,\Psi)$ is essentially free or $\Phi$ assigns zero measure to every $(d-1)$-dimensional affine hyperplane. The main result is deduced from an existing result in descriptive set theory, that is, the existence of lacunary sections. We also weaken the assumption of being essentially free to the case where a discrete group of symmetries is allowed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic shape for subadditve processes on groups of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the exploration of the limiting shape theorem for subadditive processes on finitely generated groups with polynomial growth, commonly referred to as virtually nilpotent groups. Investigating the algebraic structures underlying these processes, we present a generalized form of the asymptotic shape theorem within this framework. Extending subadditive ergodic theory in this context, we consider processes which exhibit both at most and at least linear random growth. We conclude with applications and illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic Coxeter prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1974, Kaplinskaja classified all simplicial straight hyperbolic Coxeter prisms. In this paper, we determine precisely which of these prisms are properly quasi-arithmetic or arithmetic. We also present some observations regarding commensurability classes and systoles of the associated orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Skew bracoids and the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skew braces provide an algebraic framework for studying bijective nondegenerate solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We show that left skew bracoids, recently introduced by two of the authors, can be used to obtain right nondegenerate solutions, and give a variety of examples arising from various methods of constructing left skew bracoids. We compare the solutions we obtain with the left nondegenerate solutions obtained via (left cancellative) left semibraces, and establish a correspondence between left semibraces and a class of left skew bracoids.</description>
