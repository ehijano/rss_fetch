      <title>Localization and Topology in Noncentrosymmetric Superconductors with Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Kitaev chain reveals a captivating phase diagram in the presence of various disorders, encompassing multifractal states and topological Anderson phases. In this work, we investigate the localization and topological properties of a dimerized topological noncentrosymmetric superconductor (NCS) under quasiperiodic and Anderson disorders. Using both global and local characterization methods, we identify energy-dependent transitions from ergodic to multifractal and localized states. Extended multifractal regimes emerge from the competition between dimerization, NCS order, and quasiperiodic modulation. This interplay causes localization to occur preferentially in different energy bands depending on the disorder strength, with the lowest bands exhibiting the highest sensitivity to parameter variations. We employ the real-space polarization method to compute the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant, revealing alternating topological and trivial phases as the quasiperiodic potential increases, a behavior distinct from the typical topological Anderson phase diagram. Additionally, the topological states show remarkable robustness against Anderson disorder, providing new insights into topological phase stability in non-centrosymmetric systems. Finally, we propose a feasible experimental scheme based on superconducting Josephson junctions, where NCS-like behavior can be engineered via spatially modulated supercurrents. Our findings highlight the distinct roles of different disorder types in shaping localization and topology, providing insight into the engineering of Majorana zero modes and offering profound implications for topological quantum encryption schemes.</description>

      <title>Interference-caged quantum many-body scars: the Fock space topological localization and interference zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general mechanism for realizing athermal finite-energy-density eigenstates -- termed interference-caged quantum many-body scars (ICQMBS) -- which originate from exact many-body destructive interference on the Fock space graph. These eigenstates are strictly localized to specific subsets of vertices, analogous to compact localized states in flat-band systems. Central to our framework is a connection between interference zeros and graph automorphisms, which classify vertices according to the graph's local topology. This connection enables the construction of a new class of topological ICQMBS, whose robustness arises from the local topology of the Fock space graph rather than from conventional conservation laws or dynamical constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by developing a graph-theory-based search algorithm, which identifies ICQMBS in both a one-dimensional spin-1 XY model and two-dimensional quantum link models across distinct gauge sectors. In particular, we discover the proposed topological ICQMBS in the two-dimensional quantum link model and provide an intuitive explanation for previously observed order-by-disorder phenomena in Hilbert space. Our results reveal an unexpected synergy between graph theory, flat-band physics, and quantum many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the structure and stability of nonthermal eigenstates.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Based Circuit Model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.</description>
