      <title>Synergistic control of radical generation in a radio frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jet via voltage waveform tailoring and structured electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy between voltage waveform tailoring and structured electrodes is investigated in a radio-frequency (RF) atmospheric-pressure microplasma jet operated in helium with a 0.1% oxygen admixture. The device incorporates rectangular trenches in both electrodes and is driven by "Peaks" and "Valleys" waveforms synthesized from four harmonics (base frequency $f_{\rm b} = 13.56$~MHz, $V_{\rm pp} = 500$~V, $P=$1.2~W). Two-dimensional plasma fluid simulations, together with spatially and temporally resolved optical diagnostics (Phase-Resolved Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy), are used to demonstrate that the combination of asymmetric voltage waveforms with electrode structuring leads to strong spatial localization of electron power absorption and radical generation. This synergy results in a single pronounced maximum inside a trench at either the powered or grounded electrode, depending on the applied waveform, unlike a symmetric excitation, which produces a spatially symmetric enhancement at both electrodes. The effect is attributed to the interplay between waveform-induced sheath dynamics and geometric focusing provided by the trenches, enabling electrically reversible and selective enhancement of electron power absorption at a chosen location.</description>

      <title>Exact series expansion for even frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact series representation of the even frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor is derived. Truncations are proposed that allow to evaluate the explicitly unknown second, fourth and fifth frequency moments for the finite temperature uniform electron gas. Their applicability range in terms of degeneracy parameter and wavenumber is determined by exploiting the non-interacting limit and by comparing with the quasi-exact results of path integral Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron-induced plasma facing component damage in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Roadmap article addresses the critical and multifaceted challenge of plasma-facing component (PFC) damage caused by runaway electrons (REs) in tokamaks, a phenomenon that poses a significant threat to the viability and longevity of future fusion reactors such as ITER and DEMO. The dramatically increased RE production expected in future high-current tokamaks makes it difficult to avoid or mitigate REs when a plasma discharge terminates abnormally. Preventing damage from the intense localised heat loads REs can cause requires a holistic approach that considers plasma, REs and PFC damage. Despite decades of progress in understanding the physics of REs and the thermomechanical response of PFCs, their complex interplay remains poorly understood. This document aims to initiate a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach to bridge this gap by reviewing experimental evidence, advancing diagnostic capabilities, and improving modelling tools across different scales, dimensionalities and fidelities. Key topics include RE beam formation and transport, damage mechanisms in brittle and metallic PFCs, and observations in major facilities such as JET, DIII-D, WEST and EAST. The Roadmap emphasises the urgency of predictive, high-fidelity modelling validated against well-diagnosed controlled experiments, particularly in the light of recent changes in ITER's wall material strategy and the growing importance of private sector initiatives. Each section of the article is written to provide a concise overview of one area of this multidisciplinary subject, with an assessment of the status, a look at current and future challenges, and a brief summary. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to guide future mitigation strategies and design resilient components that can withstand the loads imposed by REs, thus ensuring the safe and sustainable operation of the next generation of fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Spatial and temporal evolutions of blue-core helicon discharge driven by planar antenna with concentric rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial and temporal evolutions of blue-core helicon discharge driven by a planar antenna with four concentric rings are explored on the Linear Experimental Advanced Device (LEAD). The discharge experiences distinct density jumps from E mode to H mode, W mode, and blue-core mode, when RF input power increases. This is similar to previous observations using other typical helicon antennas; however, this special antenna could drive modes of even higher levels for which the blue-core plasma column is actually hollow in radius, i.e. peaking off-axis, which was not presented before. The column shows counterclockwise rotation for blue-core mode and clockwise rotation for non-blue-core mode. The reason could be attributed to the radial electric field differenceses for both modes which reverses the rotation direction via ExB drive. Moreover, the centrifugal instability of blue-core helicon plasma is computed using a two-fluid flowing plasma model. It shows that the instability is strong for small axial wave number but becomes weak for large axial wave number. Perturbed density peaks at radius of 0.045 m, while the equilibrium density gradient peaks at radius of 0.055 m. The coincidence of their radial locations suggests that it is a resistive drift mode driven by density gradient. The blue-core mode weakens once the magnetic field or flow rate exceeds the threshold value. Increasing power further leads to a smoother plasma density gradient. The electron temperature profiles decrease with increased power, and the radial gradient of the electron temperature inside the core is smaller as the magnetic field changes. To our best knowledge, it is the first detailed characterization of blue-core helicon plasma driven by planar antenna, especially in terms of azimuthal rotation and centrifugal instability.</description>

      <title>Analytic model for neutral penetration and plasma fueling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms recycled from wall interaction interact with confined plasma, thereby refueling it, most strongly in the region closest to the wall. This occurs near the X-point in diverted configurations, or else near the wall itself in limited configurations. A progression of analytic models are developed for neutral density in the vicinity of a planar or linear source in an ionizing domain. First-principles neutral transport simulations with DEGAS2 are used throughout to test the validity and limits of the model when using equivalent sources. The model is further generalized for strong plasma gradients or the inclusion of charge exchange. An important part of the problem of neutral fueling from recycling is thereby isolated and solved with a closed-form analytic model. A key finding is that charge exchange with the confined plasma can be significantly simplified with a reasonable sacrifice of accuracy by treating it as a loss. The several assumptions inherent to the model (and the simulations to which it is compared) can be adapted according to the particular behavior of neutrals in the divertor and the manner in which they cross the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channelling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the interplay between vortex dynamics and Lorentz forces. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Resolving discrepancies in bang-time predictions for ICF experiments on the NIF: Insights from the Build-A-Hohlraum Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigated discrepancies between measured and simulated x-ray drive in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) hohlraums at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Despite advances in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, a consistent "drive deficit" remains. Experimentally measured ICF capsule bang-times are systematically 400-700 ps later than simulations predict. The Build-A-Hohlraum (BAH) campaign explored potential causes for this discrepancy by systematically varying hohlraum features, including laser entrance hole (LEH) windows, capsules, and gas fills. Overall, the agreement between simulated and experimental x-ray drive was found to be largely unaffected by these changes. The data allows us to exclude some hypotheses put forward to potentially explain the discrepancy. Errors in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atomic modeling, errors in the modeling of LEH closure and errors due to a lack of plasma species mix physics in simulations are shown to be inconsistent with our measurements. Instead, the data supports the hypothesis that errors in NLTE emission modeling are a significant contributor to the discrepancy. X-ray emission in the 2 - 4 keV range is found to be approximately 30% lower than in simulations. This is accompanied by higher than predicted electron temperatures in the gold bubble region, pointing to errors in non-LTE modeling. Introducing an opacity multiplier of 0.87 on energy groups above 1.8 keV improves agreement with experimental data, reducing the bang-time discrepancy from 300 ps to 100 ps. These results underscore the need for refined NLTE opacity models to enhance the predictive power of hohlraum simulations.</description>

      <title>Retrospective of the ARPA-E BETHE-GAMOW-Era Fusion Programs and Project Cohorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a retrospective of the BETHE (Breakthroughs Enabling THermonuclear-fusion Energy) and GAMOW (Galvanizing Advances in Market-aligned fusion for an Overabundance of Watts) fusion programs of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), as well as fusion project cohorts (associated with OPEN 2018, OPEN 2021, and Exploratory Topics) initiated during the same time period (2018-2022). BETHE (announced in 2019) aimed to increase the number of higher-maturity, lower-cost fusion approaches. GAMOW (announced in 2020) aimed to expand and translate research-and-development efforts in materials, fuel-cycle, and enabling technologies needed for commercial fusion energy. Both programs had a vision of enabling timely commercial fusion energy while laying the foundation for greater public-private collaborations to accelerate fusion-energy development. Finally, this paper describes ARPA-E's fusion Technology-to-Market (T2M) activities during this era, which included supporting ARPA-E fusion performers' commercialization pathways, improving fusion costing models, exploring cost targets for potential early markets for fusion energy, engaging with the broader fusion ecosystem (especially investors and nongovernmental organizations), and highlighting the importance of social license for timely fusion commercialization.</description>

      <title>Collimated Hard X-Rays from Hybrid Laser and Plasma Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a synergistic enhancement of betatron radiation based on the hybrid laser and plasma wakefield acceleration scheme. Quasi-phase-stable acceleration in an up-ramp plasma density first generates GeV-energy electron beams that act as a drive beam for PWFA, which then further accelerates the witness beam to GeV energies, enhancing both photon energy and flux. A full width at half maximum divergence $(6.1 \pm 1.9)\times(5.8\pm 1.6) $ mrad$^2$ of betatron radiation, a critical energy of $71 \pm 8$ keV, and an average flux of more than $10^{14}$ photons per steradian above 5 keV were all experimentally obtained thanks to this scheme, which was an order of magnitude higher than the previous reports. Quasi-three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations were used to model the acceleration and radiation of the electrons in our experimental conditions, establishing a new paradigm for compact collimated hard X-ray sources.</description>
