      <title>A quasilinear wave with a supersonic shock in a weak solution interrupting the classical development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for classical and weak shock-forming solutions to a model quasilinear wave equation in $1+1$ dimensions arising from a convenient choice of $C^{\infty}$ initial data, which allows us to solve the equation using elementary arguments. The simplicity of our model allows us to succinctly illustrate various phenomena of geometric and analytic significance tied to shocks, which we view as a prototype for phenomena that can occur in more general quasilinear hyperbolic PDE solutions.
  Our Cauchy problem admits a classical solution that blows up in finite time. The classical solution is defined in a largest possible globally hyperbolic region called a maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD), and its properties are tied to the intrinsic Lorentzian geometry of the equation and solution. The boundary of the MGHD contains an initial singularity, a singular boundary along which the solution's second derivatives blow up (the solution and its first derivatives remain bounded), and a Cauchy horizon. Our main results provide the first example of a provably unique MGHD for a shock-forming quasilinear wave equation solution; it is provably unique because its boundary has a favorable global structure that we precisely describe.
  We also prove that for the same $C^{\infty}$ initial data, the Cauchy problem admits a second kind of solution: a unique global weak entropy solution that has a shock curve separating two smooth regions. Of particular interest is our proof that the classical and weak solutions agree before the shock but differ in a region to the future of the first singularity where both solutions are defined.</description>

      <title>On the proximal dynamics between integrable and non-integrable members of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries family of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance between the solutions to the integrable Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and a broad class of non-integrable generalized KdV (gKdV) equations is estimated in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Special cases of the latter family of equations include the standard gKdV equation with a power nonlinearity, as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. The distance estimates are established for initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size. A crucial step for their derivation is the proof of a size estimate for local solutions to the gKdV family of equations, which is linear in the norm of the initial data. As a result, the distance estimates themselves predict that the dynamics between the gKdV and KdV equations remains close over long times for initial amplitudes even close to unity, while for larger amplitudes they predict an explicit rate of deviation of the dynamics between the compared equations. These theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations in the case of one-soliton and two-soliton initial data, which are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Importantly, in the case of a power nonlinearity and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced upon incorporating suitable rotation effects by means of a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist in the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we study Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations on graphs. These are meant to be the analog of any of the following types of equations in the continuum setting of partial differential and nonlocal integro-differential equations: Hamilton-Jacobi (typically first order and local), Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann-Isaacs (first, second, or fractional order), and elliptic integro-differential equations (nonlocal equations). We give conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions of these equations, and work through a long list of examples in which these assumptions are satisfied. This work is meant to accomplish three goals: complement and unite earlier assumptions and arguments focused more on the Hamilton-Jacobi type structure; import ideas from nonlocal elliptic integro-differential equations; and argue that nearly all of the operators in this family enjoy a common structure of being a monotone function of the differences of the unknown, plus ``lower order'' terms. This last goal is tied to the fact that most of the examples in this family can be proven to have a Bellman-Isaacs representation as a min-max of linear operators with a graph Laplacian structure.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of transmission problems with parameter-dependent Robin conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a transmission problem of {N}eumann--{R}obin type involving a parameter $\alpha$ and perform an asymptotic analysis with respect to $\alpha$. The limits $\alpha \to 0$ and $\alpha \to +\infty$ correspond respectively to complete decoupling and full unification of the problem, and we obtain rates of convergence for both regimes. Biologically, the model describes two cells connected by a gap junction with permeability $\alpha$: the case $\alpha \to 0$ corresponds to a situation where the gap junction is closed, leaving only tight junctions between the cells so that no substance exchange occurs, while $\alpha \to +\infty$ corresponds to a situation that can be interpreted as the cells forming a single structure. We also clarify the relationship between the asymptotic analysis with respect to the parameter $\alpha$ and the asymptotics of the system in connection with the convergence of convex functionals known as {M}osco convergence. Finally, we consider time-dependent permeability and analyze the case where $\alpha$ blows up in finite time. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we show that the solution can be extended beyond the blow-up time, remaining in the single structure regime.</description>

      <title>Doubling Argument of the Hessian Estimate for the Special Lagrangian Equation on General Phases with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a doubling argument to obtain Hessian estimates for the special Lagrangian equation under general phase constraints. In particular, our approach does not rely on the Michael-Simon mean value inequality. As an intermediate step, we also establish Alexandrov-type theorems, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of planar viscous shock wave to three-dimensional relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of shifted planar viscous shock waves for the three-dimensional relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations, in which a modified Maxwell-type model replaces the classical Newtonian constitutive relation. Under the assumptions of sufficiently small shock strength and initial perturbations, we prove that planar viscous shock waves are nonlinearly stable. The main steps of our analysis are as follows. First, using the relative entropy method together with the framework of $a$-contraction with shifts, we derive energy estimates for the weighted relative entropy of perturbations. We then successively obtain high-order and dissipation estimates via direct energy arguments, which provide the required a priori bounds. Combining these estimates with a local existence result, we establish the global asymptotic stability of the shifted planar viscous shock wave. Finally, we show that as the relaxation parameter tends to zero, solutions of the relaxed system converge globally in time to those of the classical Navier-Stokes system.</description>

      <title>Global branching for semilinear fractional Laplace with sublinear nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the existence, nonexistence, and multiplicity of positive solutions to the sublinear fractional elliptic problem $(P_{\lambda}^s)$. We begin by establishing several a priori estimates that provide regularity results and describe the qualitative behavior of solutions. A critical threshold level for the parameter $\lambda$ is identified, which plays a crucial role in determining the existence or nonexistence of solutions. The sub and supersolution method is employed to obtain a weak solution. Furthermore, we establish a relation between the local minimizers of $\mathcal{D}^{s,2}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ versus $C(\mathbb{R}^N; 1+|x|^{N-2s})$. Combining these results with the Classical Linking Theorem, we demonstrate the existence of at least two distinct positive weak solutions to $(P_{\lambda}^s)$. This work extends the results of Yang, Abrantes, Ubilla, and Zhou (J. Differential Equations, 416:159-189, 2025) to the nonlocal setting, i.e., when $s \in (0,1)$. Several technical challenges arise in this framework, such as the lack of a standard comparison principle in $\mathbb{R}^N$ in the fractional setting.</description>

      <title>Critical curve for weakly coupled system of semilinear Euler-Poisson-Darboux-Tricomi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a weakly coupled system of semilinear Euler-Poisson-Darboux-Tricomi equations (EPDTS) with power-type nonlinear terms. More precisely, in the case where the damping terms dominate over the mass terms, the critical curve in the $p-q$ plane that delineates the threshold between global existence and blow-up for the EPDTS is given by \begin{equation*} \Gamma_m(n,p,q,\beta_1,\beta_2)=0, \end{equation*} where $\Gamma_m$ is defined by (\ref{gammam}). Through the construction of new test functions, the blow-up problem is addressed when $\Gamma_m(n,p,q,\beta_1,\beta_2)\geq0$. Based on the $(L^1\cap L^2)-L^2$ estimates of the solution to the corresponding linear equation established in our previous work \cite{LiGuo2025}, we derive the global existence of solutions with small initial data when $\Gamma_m(n,p,q,\beta_1,\beta_2)&lt;0$, provided that the damping terms prevail over the mass terms.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions to semipositone problems on Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on establishing a positive weak solution to a class of semipositone problems over the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^N$. In particular, we are interested in the positive weak solution to the following problem: \begin{equation}\label{p1}
  -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u= g(\xi)f_a(u) \text{ in } \mathbb{H}^N \tag{$P_a$}, \end{equation} where $a&gt;0$ is a real parameter and $g$ is a positive function. The function $f_a: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and of semipositone type which means it becomes negative on some parts of the domain. Due to this sign-changing nonlinearity, we can not directly apply the maximum principle to obtain the positivity of the solution to \eqref{p1}. For that purpose, we need some regularity results for our solutions. In this direction, we first prove the existence of weak solutions to \eqref{p1} via the mountain pass technique. Further, we establish some regularity properties of our solutions and using that we prove the $L^\infty$-norm convergence of the sequence of solutions $\{u_a\}$ to a positive function $u$ as $a \rightarrow 0$, which yields $u_a \geq 0$ for $a$ sufficiently small. Finally, we use the Riesz-representation formula to obtain the positivity of solutions under some extra hypothesis on $f_0$ and $g$. To the best of our knowledge, there is no article dealing with semipositone problems in Heisenberg group set up.</description>

      <title>Classification of unstable travelling wave solutions to KdV type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study travelling wave solutions to Korteweg--de Vries type equations which have double power nonlinearities with integer indices, such as the Gardner equation, and fractional dispersion. Whether these equations have ground state solutions depends on signatures of nonlinearities and parity combinations of the two indices. The aim of this study is to give the classification of phenomena of travelling wave solutions from the perspective of the signatures and parities of the indices. In this paper, we focus on unstable travelling wave solutions.</description>

      <title>A unified clasification of Liouville properties and nontrivial solution for fractional elliptic equations with general H\'enon-type superquadratic and gradient growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Liouville-type results, existence, uniqueness and symmetry to the solution of nonlinear nonlocal elliptic equations of the form \[ Lu = |x|^{\gamma}\,H(u)\,G(\nabla u), \qquad x\in\R^n, \] where $L$ is a symmetric, translation-invariant, uniformly elliptic integro--differential operator of order $2s\in(0,2)$, and $H,G$ satisfy general structural and growth conditions. A unified analytical framework is developed to identify the precise critical balance $\gamma+p=2s$, which separates the supercritical, critical, and subcritical situations. In the supercritical case $\gamma+p&gt;2s$, the diffusion dominates the nonlinear term and every globally defined solution with subcritical growth must be constant; in the critical case $\gamma+p=2s$, all bounded positive solutions are constant, showing that the nonlocal diffusion prevents the formation of nontrivial equilibria; in the subcritical case $\gamma+p&lt;2s$, we are able construct a unique, positive, radially symmetric, and monotone entire solution with explicit algebraic decay \[ u(x)\sim (1+|x|^2)^{-\beta}, \qquad \beta=\frac{2s+\gamma-p}{1-p}&gt;0. \] The proofs rely on new nonlocal analytical techniques, including quantitative cutoff estimates for general integro--differential kernels, a fractional Bernstein-type transform providing pointwise gradient control, and moving plane and sliding methods formulated in integral form to establish symmetry and uniqueness. The current investigation provides an equivalent and unifying contribution to Liouville properties and related existence results, comparable to the recent deep studies of Chen--Dai--Qin~\cite{Chen2023} and Biswas--Quaas--Topp~\cite{Biswas2025} on this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the structure of solutions to the one-phase Bernoulli problem that are modeled either infinitesimally or at infinity by one-homogeneous solutions with an isolated singularity. In particular, we prove a uniqueness of blowups result under a natural symmetry condition on the one-homogeneous solution (\`a la Allard--Almgren) and we prove a rigidity result at infinity (\`a la Simon--Solomon) under additional constraints on the linearized operator around the one-homogeneous solution (which are satisfied by the only known examples of minimizing one-homogeneous solutions). We believe these are the first uniqueness of blow-up/blow-down results at singular points for non-minimizing solutions to the one-phase problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Euclidean setting, the well-known Alexandrov theorem states that convex functions are twice differentiable almost everywhere. In this note, we extend this theorem to rank-one convex functions. Our approach is novel in that it draws more from viscosity techniques developed in the context of fully nonlinear elliptic equations. As a byproduct, the original Alexandrov theorem can essentially be reduced to the a.e. differentiability of one-dimensional monotone functions, as presented in the appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the functional of total variation of maps from an interval into a Riemannian submanifold of $\mathbb R^N$. We define a notion of strong solution to the system of equations corresponding to the $L^2$-gradient flow of this functional. We prove global existence of strong solutions for initial data of bounded variation. We show that the solutions satisfy a variational equality, and deduce uniqueness in the case of non-positive sectional curvature. We prove convergence of strong solutions to a constant map in finite time.</description>

      <title>Inverse Source Problem for a Nonlinear Parabolic Equation via Paralinearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08460v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates an inverse source problem for a semilinear parabolic equation that includes both a quadratic reaction and a convection-type nonlinearity depending on the unknown function and its gradient. Based on partial boundary observations of the time derivative and its spatial gradient on a nonempty portion of the boundary, together with interior data at a fixed time, the goal is to recover an unknown spatial source term. On a short time interval, the nonlinear part is treated by Bony paralinearization technique, which transforms the original nonlinear problem into a linear parabolic equation with small, bounded coefficients and a negligible remainder term. By differentiating the equation with respect to time, a linearized model for the time derivative of the solution is obtained, which is suitable for the application of Carleman estimates. Using these tools, the work establishes conditional stability of Holder-logarithmic type for the recovery of the source term under the same observation geometry as in the corresponding linear case. The analysis combines techniques from Littlewood-Paley theory, Besov space estimates, and Carleman inequalities, showing that the stability structure of the linear inverse source problem extends naturally to the nonlinear setting under smallness and short-time assumptions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a one-dimensional model for two-phase Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) floods, primarily for the polymer flood. We improve upon the method for the construction of semi-analytical solutions for the oil displacement by a water slug containing dissolved chemicals given in (Pires, Bedrikovetsky and Shapiro, 2006) and later generalized in (Apolin\'{a}rio, de Paula and Pires, 2020), (Apolin\'{a}rio and Pires, 2021). This method utilizes a transformation into the Lagrange coordinates that splits the equations and allows one to solve the chromatographic one-phase problem separately. The solution is then substituted into a scalar hyperbolic conservation law, which is solved using the method of characteristics. However, there is often a gap in the characteristics near the chemical shock front. It was posited to the authors that the Jouguet principle could be used to close that gap. However, no rigorous justification was given for this approach, and as such it remained a heuristic. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of the gap and its properties, and give a proper argumentation for the Jouguet heuristic and its applicability based on the Kru\v{z}kov-type uniqueness theorem for the conservation law system. Additionally, a second splitting technique within the Lagrange coordinates is developed that simplifies this analysis and the construction of characteristics.

      <title>A ballistic upper bound on the accumulation of bosonic on-site energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study transport properties of the dynamics generated by translation-invariant and possibly long-ranged Hamiltonians of Bose-Hubbard type. For translation-invariant initial states with controlled boson density, we improve the known bound on the local repulsive energy at time $t$ from $\langle n^2_x\rangle_t\lesssim t^{2d}$ to $\langle n^2_x\rangle_t\lesssim t^d$. This shows that bosonic on-site energies accumulate at most ballistically. Extending the result to higher moments would have powerful implications for bosonic Lieb-Robinson bounds. While previous approaches focused on controlling particle transport, our proof develops novel ASTLOs (adiabatic space-time localization observables) that are able to track the growth of local boson-boson correlations.</description>

      <title>Fast Direct Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey describes a class of methods known as "fast direct solvers". These algorithms address the problem of solving a system of linear equations $\boldsymbol{Ax}=\boldsymbol{b}$ arising from the discretization of either an elliptic PDE or of an associated integral equation. The matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ will be sparse when the PDE is discretized directly, and dense when an integral equation formulation is used. In either case, industry practice for large scale problems has for decades been to use iterative solvers such as multigrid, GMRES, or conjugate gradients. A direct solver, in contrast, builds an approximation to the inverse of $\boldsymbol{A}$, or alternatively, an easily invertible factorization (e.g. LU or Cholesky). A major development in numerical analysis in the last couple of decades has been the emergence of algorithms for constructing such factorizations or performing such inversions in linear or close to linear time. Such methods must necessarily exploit that the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}$ is "data-sparse", typically in the sense that it can be tessellated into blocks that have low numerical rank. This survey provides a unifying context to both sparse and dense fast direct solvers, introduces key concepts with a minimum of notational overhead, and provides guidance to help a user determine the best method to use for a given application.</description>

      <title>Derivation of resonance-based schemes via normal forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of resonance-based schemes via normal forms. The main idea is to use an arborification map on decorated trees together with a Butcher-Connes-Kreimer type coproduct and lower-dominant parts decompositions of the Fourier operator coming from the nonlinear interactions. This new family of low regularity schemes has explicit formulae for its coefficients and its local error. Under a mild assumption, one could expect these schemes to have a similar local error as the low regularity schemes proposed in arXiv:2005.01649.</description>

      <title>Elementary commutator method for the Dirac equation with long-range perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present direct and elementary commutator techniques for the Dirac equation with long-range electric and mass perturbations. The main results are absence of generalized eigenfunctions and locally uniform resolvent estimates, both in terms of the optimal Besov-type spaces. With an additional massless assumption, we also obtain an algebraic radiation condition of projection type. For their proofs, following the scheme of Ito-Skibsted, we adopt, along with various weight functions, the generator of radial translations as conjugate operator, and avoid any of advanced functional analysis, pseudodifferential calculus, or even reduction to the Schr\"odinger equation. The results of the paper would serve as a foundation for the stationary scattering theory of the Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>Fast integral methods for the Neumann Green's function: applications to capture and signaling problems in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08458v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high order numerical method for the solution of the Neumann Green's function in two dimensions. For a general closed planar curve, our computational method resolves both the interior and exterior Green's functions with the source placed either in the bulk or on the surface -- yielding four distinct functions. Our method exactly represents the singular nature of the Green's function by decomposing the singular and regular components. In the case of the interior function, we exactly prescribe an integral constraint which is necessary to obtain a unique solution given the arbitrary constant solution associated with Neumann boundary conditions. Our implementation is based on a fast integral method for the regular part of the Green's function which allows for a rapid and high order discretization for general domains. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method for simple geometries such as disks and ellipses where closed form solutions are available. To exhibit the usefulness of these new routines, we demonstrate several applications to open problems in the capture of Brownian particles, specifically, how the small traps or boundary windows should be configured to maximize the capture rate of Brownian particles.</description>

Abstract: This article establishes local strong well-posedness and global strong well-posedness close to constant equilibria of a model coupling the primitive equations of ocean and atmospheric dynamics with Hibler's viscous-plastic sea ice model. In order to treat the coupling conditions, an approach involving the hydrostatic Dirichlet and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is developed. Mapping properties of the latter operators are investigated for the first time and are of central importance for showing that the operator associated with the linearized coupled system admits a bounded $\mathcal{H}^\infty$-calculus on suitable $\mathrm{L}^q$-spaces. Quasilinear methods allow then to obtain the strong well-posedeness results described above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start the investigation of free boundary variational models featuring varying singularities. The theory depends strongly on the nature of the singular power $\gamma(x)$ and how it changes. Under a mild continuity assumption on $\gamma(x)$, we prove the optimal regularity of minimizers. Such estimates vary point-by-point, leading to a continuum of free boundary geometries. We also conduct an extensive analysis of the free boundary shaped by the singularities. Utilizing a new monotonicity formula, we show that if the singular power $\gamma(x)$ varies in a $W^{1,n^{+}}$ fashion, then the free boundary is locally a $C^{1,\delta}$ surface, up to a negligible singular set of Hausdorff co-dimension at least $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a certain type of linear boundary diffusion equation is studied. Such equation is crucial in the research of a non-linear boundary diffusion problem which was originated from the boundary heat control problem and Yamabe flow. Such equation is also analogous to the classical fast diffusion equation and porous medium equation. Under an compatible energy condition and the help of two types of test functions, $C^{1+\alpha}$-type Schauder estimates of the solution to the linear boundary diffusion equation in local configuration are obtained, through iteration to integrals both on the interior and the boundary at the same time. As applications, Schauder estimates of a new $C^{1+\alpha}$-type solution to the related boundary diffusion equations are established, which eventually provide a proof of short time existence of this new type of solution with smooth positive initial data and inhomogeneous boundary term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize weighted modulation spaces (data space) for which the heat semigroup $e^{-tL}f$ converges pointwise to the initial data $f$ as time $t$ tends to zero. Here $L$ stands for the standard Laplacian $-\Delta $ or Hermite operator $H=-\Delta +|x|^2$ on the Euclidean space. This is the first result on pointwise convergence with data in a weighted modulation spaces (which do not coincide with weighted Lebesgue spaces). We also prove that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator operates on certain modulation spaces. This may be of independent interest.</description>

We pay special attention to the convergence of unbounded self-adjoint operators in several resolvent senses, and how they are related to the convergence of their spectra. We also explore the relations that these notions of convergence have with the so-called strong graph limit, $G$-convergence, and $\Gamma$-convergence.</description>

      <title>Scalable Signature Kernel Computations for Long Time Series via Local Neumann Series Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The signature kernel is a recent state-of-the-art tool for analyzing high-dimensional sequential data, valued for its theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via adaptively truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent Goursat PDEs via adaptively truncated local power series expansions and recursive propagation of boundary conditions along a directed graph in a topological ordering. This method strikes an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy, achieving substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel. It offers (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (one million data points or more) on a single GPU. As demonstrated in our benchmarks, these advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications involving very long and highly volatile sequential data.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Gradient Shrinking Ricci Solitons with Bach-like Flatness and Related Variational Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Bach tensor in four dimensions can be expressed as a linear combination of two independent, symmetric, divergence-free, quadratic in curvature tensors U and V. Several classification results for gradient-shrinking Ricci solitons have been obtained under the assumption that the Bach tensor vanishes. We define a Bach-like tensor to be any other linear combination of U and V. We prove that, except along the Bach line, the vanishing of a Bach-like tensor forces a four-dimensional complete gradient-shrinking Ricci soliton to be either Einstein or isometric to the Gaussian soliton. Finally, we show that Bach-like tensors arise as Euler-Lagrange equations of a two-parameter family of quadratic curvature functionals and compute the corresponding first and second variation formulas.</description>
