      <title>Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of moir\'e double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moir\'e unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moir\'e Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moir\'e scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. This semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport in graphene under strain fields modeled by Dirac oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has emerged as a paradigmatic material in condensed matter physics due to its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. A deep understanding of its thermoelectric transport behavior is crucial for the development of novel nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices. In this work, we investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of monolayer graphene subjected to randomly distributed localized strain fields, which locally induce impurity-like perturbations. These strain-induced impurities are modeled via 2D Dirac oscillators, capturing the coupling between pseudorelativistic charge carriers and localized distortions in the lattice. Employing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism, we compute the relaxation time using a scattering approach tailored to the Dirac oscillator potential. From this framework, we derive analytical expressions for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. The temperature dependence of the scattering centers density is also investigated. Our results reveal how strain modulates transport coefficients, highlighting the interplay between mechanical deformations and thermoelectric performance in graphene. This study provides a theoretical foundation for strain engineering in thermoelectric graphene-based devices.</description>

      <title>Cone-dependent retro and specular Andreev reflections in AA-stacked bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the Andreev reflection (AR) in AA-stacked bilayer graphene/superconductor (AABG/SC) junction. AABG has a linear gapless energy band with two shifted Dirac cones and the electronic states are described by the cone indices. The results indicate that the property of AR strongly depends on the cone degree of freedom. In the absence of the inter-layer potential difference, only intra-cone AR and normal reflection (NR) could occur, and the inter-cone process is forbidden. By adjusting the potential, the intra-cone AR can be specular AR (SAR) in one cone and it is retro-AR (RAR) in the other cone. The existence of the inter-layer potential difference would lead to the inter-cone scattering. As a result, double ARs and double NRs can take place between the two cones. The inter-cone SAR could happen in a broad potential region. Furthermore, the inter-cone retro-NR (RNR) could happen as well. The switch between SAR and RAR, and the switch between specular NR (SNR) and RNR can be achieved by regulating the potential. Therefore, different cone carriers can be separated spatially based on the RAR and SAR. The cone-dependent Andreev conductance may be separately measured near the critical values where RAR crosses over to SAR.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Poor Man's Majoranas: The Spin-Exchange Induced Spillover Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a review on Poor Man's Majorana (PMM) modes, which are theoretically established in the minimal Kitaev chain implementation consisting of two grounded, spinless quantum dots (QDs) operating at the sweet spot condition, where electron cotunneling and crossed Andreev reflection amplitudes achieve precise balance. Particularly, we systematically review, within the Green's functions theoretical framework, the PMM hybridization dynamics under spin-exchange perturbations proposed by some of us in J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 37, 205601 (2025), which demonstrates a characteristic spatial delocalization when subjected to an exchange coupling $J$ mediated by a quantum spin $S$. This spin-exchange induced PMM spillover effect provides a spectroscopic protocol for determining the quantum statistics of $S$ through the emergent multi-level structure in the proximal QD's density of states. Our principal theoretical result establishes that the exchange interaction generates $2S+2$ ($2S+1$) satellite states symmetrically distributed about the zero-bias anomaly, serving as a definitive signature of bosonic (fermionic) spin statistics. As novelty, we demonstrate that multi-terminal environmental coupling induces significant suppression of the spin-exchange spillover mechanism. Under constrained variations of $J$, this effectively localizes the perturbed PMM within its host QD, preventing spatial hybridization with adjacent site. The absence of topological protection in this minimal Kitaev realization is strategically leveraged to: (i) Develop a novel spectroscopic technique for quantum spin characterization through PMM hybridization signatures; (ii) Propose an engineered protection scheme for PMM qubits against exchange fluctuations in multi-terminal architectures, enabling moderately robust quantum computation protocols.</description>

      <title>Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Continuum Landau surface states in a non-Hermitian Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface states of topological phases, which owe their existence to bulk topological band invariants, possess many features of deep physical significance. In some instances, they can be linked to a quantum anomaly: the violation of a classical symmetry by a field theory through the emergence of a non-conserved current. This phenomenon was recently generalized to the non-Hermitian (NH) regime, in the form of an NH chiral anomaly occurring in the surfaces states of an NH Weyl phase. Here, we show that the anomalous NH current is mediated by continnum Landau modes (CLMs) an exotic class of NH eigenstates exhibiting both spatial localization and a continuous spectrum, contrary to the usual distinction between bound and free states. The conditions for which CLMs are normalized, and their scaling of localization length with magnetic field strength, are found to match the requirements of the NH anomaly equation. We also discuss the conditions under which these surface states can be probed experimentally, such as on metamaterial platforms. For instance, under open boundary conditions, the surface states are a mix of CLMs and skin modes induced by the NH skin effect, but the NH anomaly can be observed through transmission measurements under different magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Reply to the Comment by Tikhonov and Khrapai on "Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in a topological insulator nanowire proximitized by a superconductor"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comment (arXiv:2505.23490) fails to identify any scientific errors and its central arguments actually support the main conclusions of our publication [Nat. Phys. 21, 708 (2025)]. Firstly, the whole argument of the comment to try to explain our data explicitly relies on the existence of a large crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) effect. The presence of a sizable CAR transmission probability over a surprisingly long distance is the first conclusion of our publication. Secondly, the comment discusses the complex interplay of CAR and elastic co-tunneling, especially in the presence of local effects. This complex interplay is precisely the second conclusion of our publication. In essence, the comment amounts to merely pointing out that there is a broader sense in the notion of "dominant CAR" when nonlinear effects become relevant.</description>

      <title>Glassy interphases reinforce elastomeric nanocomposites by enhancing percolation-driven volume expansion under strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nearly a century, introduction of nanoparticles to elastomers has yielded extraordinarily tough nanocomposites that are critical to technologies from actuators to tires. The mechanisms by which this reinforcement occurs have nevertheless remained a central open question in material science. One widely debated hypothesis posits that strong interactions between polymer and particles induce "glassy bridges" that cement particles into a cohesive percolating network that resists elongation. Here, molecular dynamics simulations show that glassy particle shells do not primarily provide elongational cohesion. Instead, they amplify an underlying mechanism wherein competition between filler and elastomer networks causes the elastomer's volume to increase on deformation. This induces contributions from the elastomer's bulk modulus, which is of order 1000 times larger than its Young's modulus. These findings establish a unified understanding of low-strain reinforcement in filled elastomers as emanating from volumetric competition between coexisting particulate and elastomeric networks. This reframes and unifies our understanding of low-strain reinforcement, provides a clear-cut diagnostic for the presence of glassy bridging, and offers a new design principle for tough elastomeric nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>A scalable method for cavity-enhanced solid-state quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Control Protocol for Dynamic Synthesis of Qubit and Qudit Gates Using Photonic Pulses and Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical control protocol designed for the dynamic synthesis of single qubit and four-level qudit quantum gates using external parameters, such as photonic Gaussian pulses and magnetic fields, in a microcavity quantum well system. Our approach takes advantage of tunable coherent light matter interactions that can be modulated by the magnetic field between the exciton and negative trion coupled to the lowest photonic mode. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve precise manipulation of populations of encoded quantum states through the unitary evolution of the system. In particular, we illustrate our optimization method for generating a single qubit gate with a mean fidelity of 99.99 as well as the realization of an iSWAP gate in the four level qudit case with a fidelity of 99.6.</description>

      <title>Optical spectra of small silver clusters with the Bethe-Salpeter formalism: a Reassessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optical absorption spectra of small Ag_n (n=2,4,6,8) clusters using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism with a Hamiltonian built from GW quasiparticle energies. Calculations are based on an effective core potential including the 4sp shells in the valence. Non-self-consistent G0W0 calculations relying on input Kohn-Sham eigenstates generated with semilocal functionals lead to very poor BSE absorption spectra, confirming a previous observation. However, eigenvalue or quasiparticle self-consistent GW calculations dramatically improves the agreement with experiments and TD-DFT spectra obtained with range-separated hybrid functionals. The importance of the position of the 4d occupied band is emphasized.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a non-perturbative macroscopic QED model was built that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The non-resonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Topology and criticality in non-Hermitian multimodal optical resonators through engineered losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological matter provides a platform for engineering phenomena that go beyond the capabilities of Hermitian systems, enabling the use of losses to engineer topological phenomena. Non-Hermitian models often rely on artificial platforms made of engineered lattices because controlling losses in natural compounds is challenging. Although typical models for non-Hermitian photonic matter are often single mode, photonic systems are often multimodal, producing mixing between different normal modes in each site. In this work, we explore a generalized family of multimodal non-Hermitian lattices, featuring multiple resonant modes. We show that these multimodal models are capable of featuring topological modes and criticality, similar to the artificial single-mode models often considered. We analyze the robustness of these non-Hermitian topological modes to fluctuation of local losses, disorder, and artificial gauge field. We show that these effects can be captured via both a full microscopic model and effective multiorbital models. Specifically, we show that due to their multiorbital nature, the localization properties of non-Hermitian multiorbital models can be controlled by an external gauge field. Our results demonstrate that internal orbital degrees of freedom provide a promising strategy to engineer controllable non-Hermitian topology and criticality.</description>

      <title>Laser-enhanced quantum sensing boosts sensitivity and dynamic range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as the most important solid-state quantum sensors. However, ensembles are limited in optical contrast to typically a few percent and high-sensitivity variants usually possess only a few $\mathrm{\mu}$T dynamic range. Here, we demonstrate a laser threshold magnetometry-based NV system that avoids these limitations. By integrating the NV centers into a laser cavity and showing magnetic-field-dependent shifts of the laser threshold, we observe 100\,\% contrast with strong output signals up to 50\,mW. The resulting system exhibits a dynamic range of $\pm$280\,$\mathrm{\mu}$T with a photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 670\,fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which we demonstrate to improve super-linearly with contrast. The ratio of these sensing-relevant parameters, that can be traded at the cost of each other, marks an improvement factor of 780 over typical fluorescence-based readout and vapor cell sensors. Such performance improvements open the door to new generations of sensors for applications including magnetoencephalography, magnetic navigation, and magnetic anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Excitable quantum systems: the bosonic avalanche laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a lasing system that is driven by a current of bosonic (quasi-) particles via a dissipative three-mode mixing process. A semi-classical analysis of this system predicts distinct dynamical regimes, where both the cavity mode and the gain medium can undergo lasing transitions. Of particular interest is an intermediate self-pulsing phase that exhibits the characteristics of an excitable system and converts random input signals into separated, quasi-periodic pulses at the output. By performing exact Monte-Carlo simulations, we extend this analysis into the quantum regime and show that despite being dominated by huge bosonic particle number fluctuations, this effect of coherence resonance survives even for rather low average photon numbers. Our system thus represents a intriguing model for an excitable quantum many-body system with practical relevance for quantum detectors or autonomous quantum machines. As an illustration, we discuss the realization of this system with superconducting quantum circuits and its application as a number-resolved avalanche detector for microwave photons.</description>

      <title>Brillouin Platycosms and Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist ten distinct closed flat $3$D manifolds, known as platycosms, which hold significance in mathematics and have been postulated as potential geometric models for our universe. In this work, we demonstrate their manifestation as universes of Bloch particles, namely as momentum-space units referred to as Brillouin platycosms, which are natural extensions of the Brillouin torus within a broader framework of projective crystallographic symmetries. Moreover, we provide exact K-theoretical classifications of topological insulators over these platycosms by the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and formulate a complete set of topological invariants for their identification. Topological phase transitions are generically characterized by Weyl semimetals, adhering to the generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: the total chirality number over a Brillouin platycosm is even (zero) if the platycosm is non-orientable (orientable). Our work generalizes the notion of Brillouin torus to ten Brillouin platycosms and therefore fundamentally diversifies the stages on which Block wavefunctions can perform their topological dance.</description>

      <title>The microwave phase locking in Bloch transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on observation of two coherent quantum phenomena, the current quantization in theJosephson Junction (JJ) and the Aharonov-Cashier effect. The synergy of two effects is seen as the phase locking of the JJ with the oscillating charge engaged by the microwaves (the current quantization), and a control of the phase locking phenomenon with the static charge of the gate electrode (the Aharonov-Cashier effect). The experimental system consists of two coupled JJs in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. When the microwave is applied, the quantized current plateaus appear on the I - V curve. The effect is dual to the Shapiro voltage steps in JJs. We modulate the quantized current with the static charge induced by the gate electrode. Conceptually, the system has the functionality of the Bloch Transistor: it can deliver gate-controlled quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Topology of Fermi seas and geometry of their boundaries for free particles in one and two-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free gases of spinless fermions moving on a geometric background with lattice symmetries are considered. Their Fermi seas and corresponding boundaries may be classified according to their topological properties at zero temperature. This is accomplished by considering the flat orbifolds $R^{d}/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ being the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space. For $d=1$, there are 2 topological classes: a circumference, corresponding to an insulator and an interval, identified as a conductor. For $d=2$, the number of topological classes extends to 17: there are 8 with the topology of a disk identified as conductors and 4 corresponding to a 2-sphere matching insulators, both sets eventually including finite numbers of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The rest of the listing includes single cases corresponding to insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle) and conductors (annulus, M\"obius strip). Physical interpretations of the singularities are provided, as well as examples that fit within this listing. Given the topological nature of this classification, its results are expected to be robust against small perturbative interactions.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: From many-body Chern number to anisotropy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly: When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet Cox-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of opportunities encompassing various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest additions to this growing list of materials due to its unique topologically nontrivial triple-Q (3Q) ground state. This 3Q tetrahedral structure, which critically depends on the Co content, yields the highest-density Skyrmion lattice with scalar spin chirality, resulting in a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate control of this topological phase via ionic gating. Using four CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we show that ionic gating can cover the entire 3Q topological phase and reveal the nature of the thermodynamically inaccessible phase space. Another striking finding in our data is the existence of an adiabatic discontinuity in the phase boundary between the 3Q and 1Q phases. Our work constitutes one of the first examples of electrical control of scalar spin chirality using an antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical relaxation in moir\'e materials is often modeled by a continuum model where linear elasticity is coupled to a stacking penalty known as the Generalized Stacking Fault Energy (GSFE). We review and compute minimizers of a one-dimensional version of this model, and then show how it can be formally derived from a natural atomistic model. Specifically, we show that the continuum model emerges in the limit $\epsilon \downarrow 0$ and $\delta \downarrow 0$ while holding the ratio $\eta := \frac{\epsilon^2}{\delta}$ fixed, where $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the monolayer lattice constant to the moir\'e lattice constant and $\delta$ is the ratio of the typical stacking energy to the monolayer stiffness.</description>

Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body systems exhibit nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement (SEE) is one of the efficient quantities for classifying mixed states subject to decoherence. In this work, we investigate the SEE of critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$-decoherence. We numerically show that the SEE exhibits a specific scaling law, in particular, its system-size-independent term (``$g$-function'') changes drastically its behavior in the vicinity of phase transition caused by decoherence. For the XXZ model in its gapless regime, a transition diagnosed by strong R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations occurs as the strength of the decoherence increases. We determine the location of the phase transition by investigating the $g$-function that exhibits a sharp change in the critical region of the transition. Furthermore, we find that the value of the SEE is twice that of the system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. From the viewpoint of R\'{e}nyi-2 Shannon entropy}, which is closely related to the SEE at the maximal decoherence, we clarify the origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

      <title>Singlet-only Always-on Gapless Exchange Qubits with Baseband Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Our results show that a single Slater determinant is sufficient to initialize IQPE and accurately recover ground-state energies (GSEs) in small-scale Hubbard systems. In noiseless simulations, IQPE converges within a few iterations to exact GSEs, while adiabatic simulations yield charge and spin densities and correlation functions in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To investigate these limitations in IQPE, we use the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real hardware. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Further, we implement the IQPE algorithm on IBM's ibm_strasbourg and ibm_fez devices for a reduced three-site Hubbard model, enabling direct comparison between simulated and real hardware noise. While ibm_fez runs closely match exact results, discrepancies highlight the gap between modeled and physical noise. This study demonstrates both the IQPE's potential and current limitations for simulating strongly correlated systems under realistic conditions.</description>
