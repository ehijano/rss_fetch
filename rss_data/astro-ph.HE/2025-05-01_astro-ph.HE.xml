      <title>AT 2019aalc: a Bowen Fluorescence Flare With a Precursor Flare in an Active Galactic Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT 2019aalc is a peculiar sequence of highly variable emission events observed towards the nucleus of the broad-line AGN SDSS J152416.66+045119.0. The system exhibited two distinct UV/optical flares (the first detected in 2019, the second one in 2023). Spectra obtained following the detection of the second flare revealed prominent Bowen fluorescence and high-ionization coronal emission lines, which were much weaker, if at all detectable, in a spectrum taken following the first flare. We present and analyze a large set of multi-wavelength, multi-epoch data for this source, with particular emphasis on optical spectroscopic monitoring conducted with the Las Cumbres Observatory network. During the relatively slow dimming that followed the second optical flare, the UV/optical light-curve shows a sequence of minor rebrightening events, while the Bowen fluorescence and the coronal lines vary (roughly) in tandem with these "bumps" in the broad-band light-curve. Most of the observed behavior of AT 2019aalc links it to the growing class of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) while setting it apart from canonical tidal disruption events. However, AT 2019aalc has some outstanding peculiarities, including two short flares seen in its soft X-ray light-curve during the dimming phase of the second optical flare, and which do not seem to be linked to the emission line variations. We discuss the optical and X-ray properties of the source and possible scenarios of the origin of the flare, in particular radiation pressure instabilities in the (pre-existing) AGN accretion disk.</description>

      <title>New Active Galactic Nuclei Detected by the ART-XC and eROSITA Telescopes during the First Five SRG All-Sky X-ray Surveys. Part 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our identification of 11 X-ray sources detected on the half of the sky $0^\circ&lt;l&lt;180^\circ$ in the 4-12 keV energy band on the combined map of the first five all-sky surveys with the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope onboard the SRG observatory. All these sources were also detected by the SRG/eROSITA telescope in the 0.2-8 keV energy band, whose data have allowed us to improve their positions and to investigate their X-ray spectra. Five of them have been detected in X-rays for the first time, while the remaining ones have already been known previously, but their nature has remained unknown. We have taken optical spectra for nine sources with the 1.6-m AZT-33IK telescope at the Sayan Observatory (the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences); for two more objects we have analyzed the archival spectra from SDSS and the 6dF survey. The objects are classified as Seyfert galaxies (seven Sy1, three Sy1.9, and one Sy2) at redshifts $z$=0.029-0.258. Our analysis of the X-ray spectra has revealed a noticeable intrinsic absorption ($N_{\rm H} \sim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) in two of the four Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy1.9-2). The spectrum of one more of them (SRGA J000132.9+240237) cannot be described within the model of an absorbed Comptonization continuum, which may point to a strong absorption and a significant contribution of the reflected radiation. However, the available SRG all-sky survey data are not enough to obtain reliable constraints on the absorption column density in this object, which is also interesting in that it is radio loud. Longer X-ray observations are required to refine the physical properties of this active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Nuclear Binding Near the Proton Dripline Opens Possible Bypass of the $^{64}{\rm Ge}$ rp-process Waiting Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed astrophysics model calculations with updated nuclear data to identify a possible bypass of the $^{64}{\rm Ge}$ waiting-point, a defining feature of the rapid-proton capture (rp-) process that powers type-I x-ray bursts on accreting neutron stars. We find that the rp-process flow through the $^{64}{\rm Ge}$ bypass could be up to 36\% for astrophysically relevant conditions. Our results call for new studies of $^{65}{\rm Se}$, including the nuclear mass, $\beta$-delayed proton emission branching, and nuclear structure as it pertains to the $^{64}{\rm As}(p,\gamma)$ reaction rate at x-ray burst temperatures.</description>

      <title>Extended TeV Halos May Commonly Exist around Middle-Aged Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended gamma-ray emission around isolated pulsars at TeV energies, also known as TeV halos, have been found around a handful of middle-aged pulsars. The halos are significantly more extended than their pulsar wind nebulae but much smaller than the particle diffusion length in the interstellar medium. The origin of TeV halos is unknown. Interpretations invoke either local effects related to the environment of a pulsar or generic particle transport behaviors. The latter scenario predicts that TeV halos would be a universal phenomena for all pulsars. We searched for extended gamma-ray emission around 36 isolated middle-aged pulsars identified by radio and gamma-ray facilities using 2321 days of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. Through a stacking analysis comparing TeV flux models against a background-only hypothesis, we identified TeV halo-like emission at a significance level of $5.10\,\sigma$. Our results imply that extended TeV gamma-ray halos may commonly exist around middle-aged pulsars. This reveals a previously unknown feature about pulsars and opens a new window to identify the pulsar population that is invisible to radio, x-ray, and GeV gamma-ray observations due to magnetospheric configurations.</description>

      <title>Absence of TeV halos around millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TeV halos are extended very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars. So far they have only been found around isolated pulsars, but it has been suggested that they may also be powered by millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We searched for VHE gamma-ray emission from MSPs reported by radio and GeV gamma-ray observatories in 2565 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. We found no significant emission from individual pulsars. By combining the likelihood profiles of all MSPs accessible to HAWC, our analysis suggests that the excess emission around the MSP population is consistent with a background. Our result suggests that MSPs are not as efficient as isolated pulsars in producing TeV halos. This finding has strong implications on the physics interpretation of the Galactic Center GeV excess and high-latitude Galactic diffuse emission.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Core Properties of Hybrid Stars from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to measure NS radii to better than $\sigma=0.1$ km accuracy, providing unprecedented opportunities to extract novel information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model for NS EOS encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark phase transition and satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we investigate how NS radius data with higher precision may better inform us about (1) the NS crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$, (2) the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, quark matter fraction $F_{\rm{QM}}$ and its radius $R_{\rm{QM}}$, and (3) high-density NS EOS parameters. Using fiducial NS radius data with mocked precisions varying from $\sigma=1.0$ km to 0.1 km, we found (a) the most probable crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$ and its 68\% confidence boundaries are essentially unaffected by $\sigma$ especially for massive NSs; (b) our answers to the questions (2) and (3) listed above depend sensitively on the prior range of hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$ assumed. Using its fiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\rho_t$) has a major peak around $(1.7-2.0)\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing all existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\rho_0$ consistent with the indication about $\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan Experiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\rho_t$ to $(3.0-6.0)\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\sigma$ can constrain more stringently the posterior PDF($\rho_t$), $F_{\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\rm{QM}}$ and several high-density hadronic EOS parameters.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to Neutrino-cooled Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in a tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a massive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a non-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended accretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star. The impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by approximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the accretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these results with more general initial conditions and describing the main features of the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of hypercritically accreting NSs.</description>

      <title>Spectral-timing analysis of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations and constraints on the mass of the neutron star in $4U 1636-536$ using AstroSat observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are believed to originate from the orbital timescales of the inner accretion flow, reflecting the dynamics of the innermost disk regions under strong gravitational forces. Despite numerous radiative and geometric models proposed so far, a comprehensive explanation of the observed properties of these variability components remains elusive. This study systematically examines kHz QPOs, their variability, and their connection to spectral properties in $4U 1636-536$ using AstroSat data. Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft states in the hardness-intensity diagram. Broad spectral analysis (0.7-25 keV) using SXT and LAXPC data indicates a spectrum shaped by reflection from a thermal corona, with contributions from boundary layer emission and a soft disk component. We find significant changes in optical depth, blackbody temperature, and inner disk temperature that likely drive state transitions. Power density spectra reveal three variability types: a low frequency QPO (LFQPOs) (~30 Hz), and two simultaneous kHz QPOs. The LFQPOs and the upper kHz QPOs appear more prominently in soft spectral states. The presence of LFQPOs and twin kHz QPOs in soft spectral states enable us to estimate the neutron star mass at (2.37 $\pm$ 0.02) $M_\odot$ using the relativistic precession model (RPM). Additionally, time-lag and root mean square (rms) analysis provide insights into the size of the corona and the radiative origin of these variability components.</description>

      <title>Luminosity Function of collapsar Gamma-Ray Bursts:the Progenitor of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts Is Not Singular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful probes of the high-redshift universe. However, the proportion of collapsar GRBs among long GRBs and their event rate relative to the star formation rate (SFR) remain contentious issues. We assume that long GRBs with $z\geq 2$ are all collapsar GRBs and construct the luminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite spanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law form and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results are as follows: 1) The no-evolution model can be ruled out. 2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the observations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution index $\delta = 1.54^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$) or density ($\delta = 2.09^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$) is required. This excludes the possibility that the evolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from non-collapsar GRBs. 3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z&lt;2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ is 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with $z&lt;2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. The density evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z&lt;2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of the observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long GRBs are not collapsar GRBs.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Dispersion of Gravitational Waves using Multi-Band Observation including Deci-Hertz: A Unique Probe to Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the general theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic acceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative theories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a frequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than accessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band observation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational wave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale associated with effective theory of gravity with a precision of approximately $8.6\%$ by combining only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ high SNR multi-band gravitational wave events. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more events as $\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an unexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave detector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating $\mathcal{C}$-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic self-gravitating fluids are computed using the extended Hartle structure equations, including anisotropic effects, derived in our previous paper. We focus on the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-star, whose anisotropic pressure follows a fully covariant equation of state (EoS), while a standard polytrope describes the radial pressure. We determine surface and integral properties, such as the moment of inertia, mass change, mass quadrupole moment, and ellipticity. Notably, for certain values of the compactness parameter, highly anisotropic $\mathcal{C}$-stars exhibit a prolate shape rather than the typical oblate form, an intriguing behavior also observed in other anisotropic systems like Bowers-Liang spheres and stars governed by a quasi-local EoS. Although the $\mathcal{C}$-stars considered in this study are limited by stability criteria and cannot sustain compactness beyond $M/R\approx0.38$, we found indications that certain rotational perturbations exhibit similarities to those observed in other ultracompact systems approaching the black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Can We Probe Spacetime Non-commutativity Through Tidal Deformability of Compact Objects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of spacetime non-commutativity on the tidal deformability of compact objects and explore the feasibility of detecting non-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We considered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge theory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While several types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing spacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study showed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their surface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their tidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness limit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute the NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several different models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing the results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness regimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be amplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction dominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the black-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars are not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while relying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.</description>

      <title>Unified QMF equation of state for neutron star matter: Static and dynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a set of unified equations of state based on the quark mean field (QMF) model, calibrated to different values of nuclear symmetry energy slope at the saturation density ($L_0$), with the aim of exploring both the static properties and dynamical behavior of neutron stars (NSs), and building a coherent picture of their internal structure. We assess the performance of these QMF models in describing the mass-radius relation, the cooling evolution of isolated NSs and X-ray transients, and the instabilities (e.g., the r-mode). In comparison to relativistic mean field (RMF) models formulated at the hadronic level, the QMF model predicts heavier nuclear clusters and larger Wigner-Seitz cell sizes in the NS crust, while the density of the free neutron gas remains largely similar between the two approaches. For the cooling of isolated NSs, the thermal evolution is found to be insensitive to both the many-body model and the symmetry energy slope in the absence of the direct Urca (dUrca) process. However, when rapid cooling via the dUrca process is allowed, in the case of large $L_0$ values (e.g., $L_0 \gtrsim 80$ MeV) in our study, the QMF model predicts a longer thermal relaxation time. Both the QMF and RMF models can reproduce cooling curves consistent with observations of X-ray transients (e.g., KS 1731--260) during their crustal cooling phase, although stellar parameters show slight variations depending on the model and symmetry energy slope. Within our unified framework, a larger $L_0$ value generally results in a wider instability window, while increasing the stellar mass tends to suppress the instability window. We also provide simple power-law parameterizations that quantify the dependence of bulk and shear viscosities on the symmetry energy slope for nuclear matter at saturation density.</description>

      <title>Joint inference for gravitational wave signals and glitches using a data-informed glitch model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise transients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal parameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing step, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g. BayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to build a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known glitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on the glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference analysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch identification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show that this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly improving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.</description>

      <title>Dispersion properties of neutron star magnetospheric plasmas with relativistic kappa distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The various distribution functions can encompass the diverse characteristics of the magnetospheric plasma of surrounding neutron stars in both hot and cold environments; however, the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution is so far widely used to characterize these plasmas. We aim to analyze the linear dispersion properties yielded from the relativistic kinetic dispersion relation for the neutron star magnetospheric plasmas. We developed a numerical dispersion solver to investigate plasmas with arbitrary velocity distributions and focus on the comparison of relativistic kappa and Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution functions as analytical representatives. By considering different kappa distribution indices and using analytical and numerical approaches, the dispersion properties of the kappa and Maxwell-J\"uttner distributions approach each other for high wave numbers and low temperatures, indicating that the choice of distribution functions has little effect on high wave numbers $ck/\omega_p \gg 1$ and high inverse temperatures $\rho=100$. However, each distribution function exhibits unique yet complementary properties in semi-relativistic to relativistic inverse temperatures $\rho \leq 10^{-1}$ and at lower wave numbers $ck/\omega_p\leq 1$. This highlights the necessity of utilizing such a dispersion solver for these wave numbers to properly comprehend the dispersion properties of the neutron star magnetospheric plasmas.</description>

      <title>Detection of Unresolved Strongly Lensed Supernovae with 7-Dimensional Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multitelescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 7.46 events for type Ia, 2.49 for type Ic, 0.8 for type IIb, 0.52 for type IIL, 0.78 for type IIn, 3.75 for type IIP, and 1.15 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-field Time-domain Survey (WTS)program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 2.53 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.7\%$ precision in estimating the $H_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) has been a long-standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low-mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using data from both the Montreal White Dwarf Database and a 20 pc volume-limited sample from Gaia DR2, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarf forms. Crystallization dynamos, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with the progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing a field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints, with mergers best able to explain the high mass, strongly magnetized young MWDs. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>

      <title>A Massive Black Hole 0.8 kpc from the Host Nucleus Revealed by the Offset Tidal Disruption Event AT2024tvd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) that are spatially offset from the nuclei of their host galaxies offer a new probe of massive black hole (MBH) wanderers, binaries, triples, and recoiling MBHs. Here we present AT2024tvd, the first off-nuclear TDE identified through optical sky surveys. High-resolution imaging with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} shows that AT2024tvd is $0.914\pm 0.010^{\prime\prime}$ offset from the apparent center of its host galaxy, corresponding to a projected distance of $0.808\pm 0.009$ kpc at $z=0.045$. Chandra and VLA observations support the same conclusion for the TDE's X-ray and radio emission. AT2024tvd exhibits typical properties of nuclear TDEs, including a persistent hot UV/optical component that peaks at $L_{\rm bb}\sim 6\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, broad hydrogen lines in its optical spectra, and delayed brightening of luminous ($L_{\rm X,peak}\sim 3\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$), highly variable soft X-ray emission. The MBH mass of AT2024tvd is $10^{6\pm1}\,M_\odot$, at least 10 times lower than its host galaxy's central black hole mass ($\gtrsim 10^8\,M_\odot$). The MBH in AT2024tvd has two possible origins: a wandering MBH from the lower-mass galaxy in a minor merger during the dynamical friction phase or a recoiling MBH ejected by triple interactions. Combining AT2024tvd with two previously known off-nuclear TDEs discovered in X-rays (3XMM J2150 and EP240222a), which likely involve intermediate-mass black holes in satellite galaxies, we find that the parent galaxies of all three events are very massive ($\sim 10^{10.9}\,M_\odot$). This result aligns with expectations from cosmological simulations that the number of offset MBHs scales linearly with the host halo mass.</description>
