      <title>A novel approach to determining the age of stellar clusters: application to NGC 188</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new independent determination for the age of one of the oldest open clusters, NGC 188: $6.41 \pm 0.33$ Gyr. We utilize a novel approach where we jointly fit the radial velocities (RVs) and spectral energy distributions (SED) of six binary star systems in the cluster. The joint fit has 21 free parameters: 12 stellar masses, 6 orbital inclination angles, as well as a common cluster age, distance, and extinction, $A_V$. The fit to the SEDs utilizes MIST stellar isochrones, and the fitted stellar parameters are presented in HR diagrams (R - $T_{\rm eff}$, R - M, and M - $T_{\rm eff}$) showing the stars' different states of evolution. These isochrones are compared with PARSEC and Y2 isochrones to obtain an estimate of the uncertainties introduced by different stellar models. Of the 3017 stars taken from the NGC 188 field, 333 possible member stars were selected using Gaia data and analyzed separately for their mean distances and proper motions. We find a distance to NGC 188 of $1850 \pm 12$ pc compared with the independent photometric distance found from the SED fitting of $1897 \pm 58$ pc.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Radiation-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Luminous Red Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during stellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to illuminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the CEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However, the mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their observed diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account hydrogen recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass stellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\odot$ with a characteristic velocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\odot$ of equatorially concentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of non-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve is composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly shock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and durations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the durations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of the same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of the CBM. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures during the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly compatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the way for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a Long-Lived Deep-Seated Main-Sequence Magnetic Field During White Dwarf Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields that originate from core-convective dynamos during the main-sequence. Using stellar evolution and WD cooling models combined with magnetic field diffusion calculations, we demonstrate that a surviving field from the main-sequence can account for various features observed in magnetic WDs. In particular, the earlier emergence of stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less massive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is because the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less massive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic field due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that many of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can be reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is comparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the main-sequence dynamo. Additionally, our predictions for surface magnetic fields vary by a factor of 2 to 4 when higher-order modes of poloidal magnetic field expansion and turbulent diffusion driven by crystallization-induced convection are included. These effects should therefore be considered when investigating the origin of magnetic fields in individual WDs.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Radial Evolution of O$^{6+}$ Temperature and Differential Flow in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over decades of solar wind observations, heavy ions have been observed to have a higher temperature and flow faster than protons in the solar corona and heliosphere. Remote observations have largely been limited to the low corona ($&lt; 4R_{\odot}$), while in situ observations for heavy ions ($Z&gt;2$) have only been sampled at 1 au and beyond. As a result, theories that address heavy ion heating and acceleration remain largely unconstrained. With the launch of Solar Orbiter, heavy ion kinetics can be probed closer to the Sun, as close as the orbit of Mercury ($65R_{\odot}$), to examine their radial behavior. Through a statistical analysis of O$^{6+}$, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the velocity and temperature of O$^{6+}$ from 0.3 au to 1 au. The study finds that the O$^{6+}$ relative drift, normalized to the local Alfv\'en speed, and its temperature compared to protons, both decrease with distance from the Sun and show some speed dependence. The O$^{6+}$ temperature is well fit by a single temperature adiabatic profile across all wind speeds, suggesting there is no significant heating at these heliocentric distances. This is in contrast to what is observed for protons and He$^{2+}$. Alfv\'enic fluctuations, with full 180$^{\circ}$ field rotation, create momentary negative differential streaming where the speed of O$^{6+}$ trails the protons. The amount of negative differential streaming gradually increases at larger distances. These results provide critical constraints to the proposed mechanisms seeking to describe ion heating and acceleration in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Classifying Cool Dwarfs: Comprehensive Spectral Typing of Field and Peculiar Dwarfs Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.</description>

      <title>Constraining intrinsic S-type AGB masses and third dredge-up using pulsation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lowest mass at which the third dredge-up (TDU) occurs for thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars remains a key uncertainty in detailed stellar models. S-type AGB stars are an important constraint on this uncertainty as they have C/O ratios between 0.5 and 1, meaning they have only experienced up to a few episodes of TDU. AGB stars are also long-period variable stars, pulsating in low order radial pulsation modes. In this paper we estimate the initial masses of a large literature sample of intrinsic S-type AGB stars, by analysing their visual light curves, estimating their luminosities with Gaia DR3 parallax distances and finally comparing to a grid of detailed stellar models combined with linear pulsation models. We find that the initial mass distribution of intrinsic S-type stars peaks at 1.3 to 1.4 \Msun, depending on model assumptions. There also appear to be stars with initial masses down to 1 solar mass, which is in conflict with current detailed stellar models. Additionally, we find that though the mass estimates for semiregular variable stars pulsating in higher order radial modes are precise, the Mira variables pulsating in the fundamental mode present challenges observationally from uncertain parallax distances, and theoretically from the onset of increased mass-loss and the necessity of non-linear pulsation models.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of the Protoplanetary Nebula OH\,231.8+4.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. OH 231.8+4.2 , also known as the Rotten Egg or Calabash nebula is a protoplanetary nebula which is seen in the direction of the open cluster M 46. While an association of the nebula with the cluster has been suggested in the past, this has been never confirmed. Here, we present accurate trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements using VLBI observations of masers in the nebula and Gaia DR3 data for the cluster.
  Methods. We observed 22 GHz H2O and 43 GHz SiO masers around OH 231.8+4.2 using the Very Long Baseline Array at 4 epochs over 1 year. We also calculated the parallax and proper motion of the open star cluster M 46 using Gaia DR3 data.
  Results. Based on astrometric monitoring for 1 year, we measured an annual parallax of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 0.65 +\- 0.01 mas (stat.) +\- 0.02 mas (syst.), corresponding to a distance of 1.54 +\- 0.05 kpc. This agrees well with the parallax of M 46 from the Gaia DR3 data, which is 0.639 +\- 0.001 mas (stat.) +\- 0.010 mas (syst.). We re-estimated the luminosity of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 1.4 x 10^4 L_sol. However, there is a 15 km/s velocity difference between OH 231.8+4.2 and M 46 which could be caused by a past merger event.</description>

      <title>The Hot Inner AU of V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The V883 Ori system is a rapidly accreting young stellar object that has been used as a laboratory for studying the molecular inventory of young circumstellar disks with high luminosity. We simultaneously fit high resolution spectroscopy and medium resolution spectrophotometry of the system to constrain the physical conditions in the inner au. Using our thin viscous accretion disk model, we find $\dot{M} = 10^{-3.9 \pm 0.2} \ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $R_\mathrm{inner} = 5.86 \pm 1 \ R_\odot$, $i = 38.2 \pm 3$ degrees and $A_V = 20.8 \pm 0.7$ mag, resulting in an accretion luminosity of 458 $L_\odot$ and maximum disk temperature of 7045 K. The optical portion of the SED greatly exceeds the flux level expected for a highly extincted accretion disk. We propose that the excess emission arises from a contribution due to scattering of the accretion disk spectrum off nearby envelope material that is viewed along a less-extincted line of sight. Additionally, we use photometric observations spanning 137 years to demonstrate that the source has accreted at least 18 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ of disk material to date. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering both the viscous heating from the midplane and the consequent irradiation effects on the outer disk when modeling the temperature structure to reproduce millimeter-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Chemical composition of planetary hosts: II. Abundances of neutron-capture elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of neutron-capture element abundances (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Eu) in a large and homogeneous sample of 160 F-, G-, and K-type planet-host stars located in the northern hemisphere, including 32 stars in multi-planetary systems. The sample hosts a total of 175 high-mass planets and 47 Neptunian and super-Earth planets. High-resolution spectra were obtained with the 1.65-metre telescope at the Mol\.etai Astronomical Observatory using a fibre-fed spectrograph covering 4000-8500 \r{A}. Elemental abundances were determined by differential line-by-line spectrum synthesis with the TURBOSPECTRUM code and MARCS model atmospheres. The analysis of $[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ ratios shows that most elements in PHSs follow the Galactic chemical evolution, but $[\mathrm{Zr}/\mathrm{Fe}]$, $[\mathrm{La}/\mathrm{Fe}]$, and $[\mathrm{Ce}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ are overabundant in PHSs relative to reference stars at a given $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]$. Correlations between $[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ and planet mass are generally positive, except for Sr, Y, and Ba, which show no significant trends. The distribution of $\Delta[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{H}]$ versus condensation temperature ($T_{\mathrm{cond}}$) slopes is positively skewed for PHSs, indicating enrichment in refractory elements compared to analogues. While no strong correlations are found between $\Delta[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{H}]$-$T_{\mathrm{cond}}$ slopes and stellar or planetary parameters, older dwarf stars with multiple planets tend to have smaller or negative slopes, whereas younger dwarf stars exhibit larger positive slopes. Our results also confirm that multi-planetary systems are more frequent around metal-rich stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 10,059 new three-dimensional periodic orbits of general three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very few three-dimensional (3D) periodic orbits of general three-body problem (with three finite masses) have been discovered since Newton mentioned it in 1680s. Using a high-accuracy numerical strategy we discovered 10,059 three-dimensional periodic orbits of the three-body problem in the cases of $m_{1}=m_{2}=1$ and $m_{3}=0.1n$ where $1\leq n\leq 20$ is an integer, among which 1,996 (about 20\%) are linearly stable. Note that our approach is valid for arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large amount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three equal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits whose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very interesting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273 three-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving along a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\neq 1$) along a different one: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one piano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never been reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these new 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about chaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say, the only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to now, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\'e, the founder of chaos theory.</description>

      <title>New Metrics for Identifying Variables and Transients in Large Astronomical Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key science goal of large sky surveys such as those conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the identification of variable and transient objects. One approach is the statistical analysis of the time series of the changing brightness of sources, that is, their light curves. However, finding adequate statistical representations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues such as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance factors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects that a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric assumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a Gaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve variability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions about the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a range of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint distribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and transient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394 radio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two variability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely $\eta_\nu$ and $V_\nu$, and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and interpretability. Finally, we conduct a rudimentary search for transient sources in the ThunderKAT dataset to demonstrate how our approach might be used as an initial screening tool. Computational notebooks in Python and R are available to help facilitate the deployment of this framework to other surveys.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey VIII. Final ASPCAP results for all clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulge globular clusters(BGCs) are exceptional tracers of the formation and chemodynamical evolution of this oldest Galactic component.However, until now, observational difficulties have prevented us from taking full advantage of these powerful Galactic archeological tools. CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of which have been poorly studied. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for metallicity,[alpha/Fe],and radial velocity, as well as abundances for 11 other elements. We present final parameters based on ASPCAP for all 18 CAPOS BGCs. We carry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR&gt;70 and 125 with lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe] abundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and global alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The [Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean metallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05 dex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show strong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22. Abundances for 11 other elements using only 1st population stars are calculated and are generally in good agreement with the literature. We develope a new chemodynamical GC classification scheme, synthesizing several recent studies. We also compile up-to-date metallicities. The BGC metallicity distribution is bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly dominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we find only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe] of in and exsitu GCs. The 4 GCs with the lowest [Si/Fe] values are all exsitu, relatively young, and 3 belong to Sagittarius, but no other correlations are evident.</description>

Abstract: Second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binaries, provide insights into poorly understood mechanisms of dust processing and disc evolution across diverse stellar environments. We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five evolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using the Very Large Telescope SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show significant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often exceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum fractional polarisation of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band and ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarisation, we combine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS studies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue polarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional polarisation of the scattered light and polarised intensity distribution, these findings are consistent with a surface dust composition dominated by porous aggregates, reinforcing independent observational evidence for such grains in post-AGB circumbinary discs. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries within the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and significant variations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems (U Mon, V709 Car). On comparing post-AGB discs to circumstellar environments around AGB stars and YSOs, we found that post-AGB systems exhibit a higher degree of polarisation than single AGB stars and are comparable to the brightest protoplanetary discs around YSOs.</description>

      <title>On the stability analysis of astrophysical cooling functions</title>

Abstract: To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pre-tabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes, these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus' instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, $\Lambda_c$, that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore extend Balbus' criteria to account for thermal conduction. Upon applying a $\Lambda_c$-based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.</description>

      <title>C3PO V: Comoving stellar pairs indicate rotational spin-down drives the main-sequence Li-Dip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i &gt; 12 km/s shows higher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher A(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>

Abstract: The simulation of gravitational wave source populations and their progenitors is an endeavor more than eighty years in the making. This is in part due to a wide variety of theoretical uncertainties that must be taken into account when describing how stellar populations evolve over cosmic time to produce double stellar remnant binaries. Population synthesis software has been developed as a means to investigate these uncertainties under a wide variety of physical assumptions and stellar population formation environments. In this chapter we discuss the development history of population synthesis software with a special focus on work aimed at understanding the formation of gravitational wave populations. We detail the assortment of population synthesis tools in use today that simulate GW populations which are born and evolve in different astrophysical environments. We further discuss the GW population rates and features associated with each environment that have been predicted for both ground and space-based GW detectors. We finish with considerations of future work that combines possible constraints from electromagnetic surveys that may provide key findings that break current degeneracies in population synthesis predictions of GW source populations.</description>

      <title>A Wavelength-Aware Unsupervised Learning Approach for Large, Multicolor, Photometric Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational astronomy has undergone a significant transformation driven by large-scale surveys, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Gaia Mission. These programs yield large, complex datasets that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, and as a result, many different machine learning techniques are being tested and deployed. We introduce a new approach to analyzing multiband photometry by using a long-short term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE). This model provides input-dependent reweighting across passbands on a star-by-star basis, enabling it to encode patterns present in the stars' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into a two-dimensional latent space. We showcase this by using Pan-STARRS grizy mean magnitudes, and we use globular clusters, labels from SIMBAD, Gaia DR3 parallaxes, and PanSTARRS images to aid our analysis and understanding of the latent space. For 3,112,259 stars in an annulus around the North Galactic Cap, 99.51% have their full SED shape reconstructed--that is the absolute difference between the observed and the model predicted magnitude in every band--within five hundredths of a magnitude. We show that the model likely denoises photometric data, potentially improving the quality of measurements. Lastly, we show that the detection of rare stellar types can be performed by analyzing poorly reconstructed photometry.</description>
