      <title>Contemporaneous X-ray Observations of 30 Bright Radio Bursts from the Prolific Fast Radio Burst Source FRB 20220912A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive contemporaneous X-ray and radio campaign performed on the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20220912A for eight weeks immediately following the source's detection by CHIME/FRB. This includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, NICER, and Swift, and radio detections of FRB 20220912A from CHIME/Pulsar and Effelsberg. We detect no significant X-ray emission at the time of 30 radio bursts with upper limits on $0.5-10.0$ keV X-ray fluence of $(1.5-14.5)\times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (99.7% credible interval, unabsorbed) on a timescale of 100 ms. Translated into a fluence ratio $\eta_{\text{ x/r}} = F_{\text{X-ray}}/F_{\text{radio}}$, this corresponds to ${\eta}_{\text{ x/r}} &lt; 7\times10^{6}$. For persistent emission from the location of FRB 20220912A, we derive a 99.7% $0.5-10.0$ keV isotropic flux limit of $8.8\times 10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (unabsorbed) or an isotropic luminosity limit of 1.4$\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 362.4 Mpc. We derive a hierarchical extension to the standard Bayesian treatment of low-count and background-contaminated X-ray data, which allows the robust combination of multiple observations. This methodology allows us to place the best (lowest) 99.7% credible interval upper limit on an FRB ${\eta}_{\text{ x/r}}$ to date, ${\eta}_{\text{ x/r}} &lt; 2\times10^6$, assuming that all thirty detected radio bursts are associated with X-ray bursts with the same fluence ratio. If we instead adopt an X-ray spectrum similar to the X-ray burst observed contemporaneously with FRB-like emission from Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 detected on 2020 April 28, we derive a 99.7% credible interval upper limit on ${\eta}_{\text{ x/r}}$ of $8\times10^5$, which is only 3 times the observed value of ${\eta}_{\text{ x/r}}$ for SGR 1935+2154.</description>

      <title>Ejecta masses in Type Ia Supernovae -- Implications for the Progenitor and the Explosion Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progenitor system(s) as well as the explosion mechanism(s) of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae are long-standing issues in astrophysics. Here we present ejecta masses and other physical parameters for 28 recent Type Ia supernovae inferred from multiband photometric and optical spectroscopic data. Our results confirm that the majority of SNe Ia show {\it observable} ejecta masses below the Chandrasekhar-limit (having a mean $M_{\rm ej} \approx 1.1 \pm 0.3$ M$_\odot$), consistent with the predictions of recent sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$ explosion models. They are compatible with models assuming either single- or double-degenerate progenitor configurations. We also recover a sub-sample of supernovae within $1.2 $ M$_\odot$ $&lt; M_{\rm {ej}} &lt; 1.5$ M$_\odot$ that are consistent with near-Chandrasekhar explosions. Taking into account the uncertainties of the inferred ejecta masses, about half of our SNe are compatible with both explosion models. We compare our results with those in previous studies, and discuss the caveats and concerns regarding the applied methodology.</description>

      <title>Orbital motion of NGC 6166 (3C 338) and its impact on the jet morphology at kiloparsec scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the central region of the galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199) resides the cD galaxy NGC 6166, which spatially coincides with the 3C 338 radio source. Lobes, jets, and a more detached southern structure (similar to a jet labelled as ridge) are seen at kiloparsec-scale images of 3C 338. This unusual radio morphology has led to the proposition of different hypotheses about its physical origin in the literature. In this work, we study the feasibility of a dynamical scenario where NGC 6166 moves around the X-ray inferred centre of A2199 from the point of view of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The physical characteristics of the intra-cluster medium in which the jet propagates are constrained to those derived from X-ray observations in the vicinity of NGC 6166. Possible orbits for the jet inlet region are derived from the estimated radial velocity of NGC 6166, while the jet parameters are constrained by parsec-scale interferometric radio observations and the estimated jet power of 3C 338 obtained from radio and X-ray data. Our results show that the hypothesis of NGC 6166 has been moving around the centre of A2199 during the last tens of million of years is compatible with the general radio morphology of 3C 338. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic scenario for the motion of NGC 6166 may be linked to gravitational perturbations induced by the passage of a sub-cluster of galaxies hundreds of millions of years ago.</description>

      <title>Layers of electron captures in the crust of accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accumulation of accreted matter onto the neutron star surface triggers exothermic reactions in the crust. The heat released as a result influences the luminosity exhibited by the X-ray transient. The most common approach to the kinetics of exothermic reactions in the crust of accreting neutron stars is to consider an infinite reaction rate. Here, we investigate accretion-related heat release in the accreted outer crust of a neutron star by including a time-dependent accretion cycle and experimentally based reaction rates in the kinetics of electron captures above the reaction threshold. A simple model was used to compute the zero temperature equation of state of a crust in which two nuclei can coexist. We solved the abundance of parent nuclei as a function of the depth in the star and the time variable using astrophysically motivated features of the accreting system. We calculated the heat release and neutrino loss associated to reactions in the outer crust. We report the existence of layers in the outer crust, which contain both parent and grand-daughter nuclei of electron captures. The reactions can occur deeper in the shell than the reaction threshold, thus releasing more heat per accreted baryon for a given accretion rate. The electron capture layers continue to exist even when the accretion has stopped. The heat sources are time- and pressure-dependent in accreting crusts of neutron stars. The total heat released is a function of astrophysical (active and quiescent time) and microscopic (reaction rate) parameters Therefore, we conclude these parameters should be considered individually and carefully for a range of different sources.</description>

      <title>Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations of Massive Stars in Gas-rich Environments: Accretion of AGN Stars Suppressed By Thermal Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars may form in or be captured into AGN disks. Recent 1D studies employing stellar-evolution codes have demonstrated the potential for rapid growth of such stars through accretion up to a few hundred $M_\odot$. We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of moderately massive stars' envelopes, in order to determine the rate and critical radius $R_{\rm crit}$ of their accretion process in an isotropic gas-rich environment in the absence of luminosity-driven mass loss. We find that in the ``fast-diffusion" regime where characteristic radiative diffusion speed $c/\tau$ is faster than the gas sound speed $c_s$, the accretion rate is suppressed by feedback from gravitational and radiative advection energy flux, in addition to the stellar luminosity. Alternatively, in the ``slow-diffusion" regime where $c/\tau&lt;c_s$, due to adiabatic accretion, the stellar envelope expands quickly to become hydrostatic and further net accretion occurs on thermal timescales in the absence of self-gravity. When the radiation entropy of the medium is less than that of the star, however, this hydrostatic envelope can become more massive than the star itself. Within this sub-regime, self-gravity of the envelope excites runaway growth. Applying our results to realistic environments, moderately massive stars ($\lesssim 100M_\odot$) embedded in AGN disks typically accrete in the fast-diffusion regime, leading to reduction of steady-state accretion rate 1-2 orders of magnitudes lower than expected by previous 1D calculations and $R_{\rm crit}$ smaller than the disk scale height, except in the opacity window at temperature $T\sim 2000$K. Accretion in slow diffusion regime occurs in regions with very high density $\rho\gtrsim 10^{-9}$g/cm$^3$, and needs to be treated with caution in 1D long-term calculations.</description>

      <title>Search for neutrino signals correlated with LHAASO diffuse Galactic emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium or radiation fields within our Galaxy, where the production of neutrinos is also anticipated. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported measurements of diffuse $\gamma$-rays from the Galactic plane with energies ranging from sub-TeV to 1 PeV. Using publicly available 7 years of IceCube track data with the full detector, we conduct a template search using the $\gamma$-ray flux map observed by LHAASO-KM2A as the neutrino emission template and perform a scan search of the Galactic plane. In the template search, a mild excess of neutrinos is observed in the Galactic plane with a pretrial significance of $1.9\sigma$. The measured muon neutrino intensity at 25 TeV is $4.73^{+2.53}_{-2.51}\times10^{-14}\,{\rm TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$, consistent with the expected neutrino flux assuming that all the diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-rays originate from hadronic interactions. In the Galactic plane scan search, the most significant location is found at $l=63.57^{\circ}$ and $b=0.93^{\circ}$ with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of $4.6\sigma$ ($1.8\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-like Particles from the gamma-ray observation of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy photons originating from the Galactic Center (GC) region have the potential to undergo significant photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillation effects, primarily induced by the the presence of intense magnetic fields in this region. Observations conducted by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes have detected very high energy gamma-rays originating from a point source known as HESS J1745-290, situated in close proximity to the GC. This source is conjectured to be associated with the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A$^*$. The GC region contains diverse structures, including molecular clouds and non-thermal filaments, which collectively contribute to the intricate magnetic field configurations in this region. By utilizing a magnetic field model specific in the GC region, we explore the phenomenon of photon-ALP oscillations in the gamma-ray spectrum of HESS J1745-290. Our analysis does not reveal any discernible signature of photon-ALP oscillations, yielding significant constraints that serve as a complement to gamma-ray observations of extragalactic sources across a broad parameter region. The uncertainties arising from the outer Galactic magnetic field models have minor impacts on our results, except for ALP masses around 10$^{-7}$ eV, as the dominant influence originates from the intense magnetic field strength in the inner GC region.</description>

      <title>Black hole X-ray spectra: notes on the relativistic calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a collection of notes to calculate electromagnetic spectra of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disks around black holes. The presentation is intentionally pedagogical and most calculations are reported step by step. In the disk-corona model, the spectrum of a source has three components: a thermal component from the disk, a Comptonized component from the corona, and a reflection component from the disk. These notes review only the relativistic calculations. The formulas presented here are valid for stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically-flat, circular spacetimes, so they can be potentially used for a large class of black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium $-$ X. Flash spectral features in the Type Ibn SN 2019cj and observations of SN 2018jmt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared observations of two Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj. Their light curves have rise times of about 10 days, reaching an absolute peak magnitude of $M_g$(SN 2018jmt) = $-$19.07 $\pm$ 0.37 and $M_V$(SN 2019cj) = $-$18.94 $\pm$ 0.19 mag, respectively. The early-time spectra of SN 2018jmt are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow (600$-$1000 km~s$^{-1}$) He I lines with P-Cygni profile. At later epochs, the spectra become more similar to those of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc. At early phases, the spectra of SN 2019cj show flash ionisation emission lines of C III, N III and He II superposed on a blue continuum. These features disappear after a few days, and then the spectra of SN 2019cj evolve similarly to those of SN 2018jmt. The spectra indicate that the two SNe exploded within a He-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) lost by the progenitors a short time before the explosion. We model the light curves of the two SNe Ibn to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. The ejecta masses are consistent with either that expected for a canonical SN Ib ($\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) or those from a massive WR star ($&gt;$ $\sim$ 4 M$_{\odot}$), with the kinetic energy on the order of $10^{51}$ erg. The lower limit on the ejecta mass ($&gt;$ $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) argues against a scenario involving a relatively low-mass progenitor (e.g., $M_{ZAMS}$ $\sim$ 10 M$_{\odot}$). We set a conservative upper limit of $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ for the $^{56}$Ni masses in both SNe. From the light curve modelling, we determine a two-zone CSM distribution, with an inner, flat CSM component, and an outer CSM with a steeper density profile. The physical properties of SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj are consistent with those expected from the core collapse of relatively massive, stripped-envelope (SE) stars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae with the Line Emission Mapper: Observing Cassiopeia A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) display complex morphologies and asymmetries, reflecting anisotropies from the explosion and early interactions with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Spectral analysis of these remnants can provide critical insights into supernova (SN) engine dynamics, the nature of progenitor stars, and the final stages of stellar evolution, including mass-loss mechanisms in the millennia leading up to the SN.
  This white paper evaluates the potential of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM), an advanced X-ray probe concept proposed in response to NASA 2023 APEX call, to deliver high-resolution spectra of SNRs. Such capabilities would allow detailed analysis of parent SNe and progenitor stars, currently beyond our possibilities. We employed a hydrodynamic model that simulates the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from core-collapse to a 2000-year-old mature remnant. This model successfully replicates the large-scale properties of Cassiopeia A at an age of about 350 years.
  Using this model, we synthesized mock LEM spectra from different regions of the SNR, considering factors like line shifts and broadening due to plasma bulk motion and thermal ion motion, deviations from ionization and temperature equilibrium, and interstellar medium absorption. Analyzing these mock spectra with standard tools revealed LEM impressive capabilities. We demonstrated that fitting these spectra with plasma models accurately recovers the line-of-sight velocity of the ejecta, enabling 3D structure exploration of shocked ejecta, similar to optical methods. LEM also distinguishes between Doppler and thermal broadening of ion lines and measures ion temperatures near the limb of SNRs, providing insights into ion heating at shock fronts and cooling in post-shock flows. This study highlights LEM potential to advance our understanding of core-collapse SN dynamics and related processes.</description>

Abstract: We analyze distributions of the spatial scales of coherent intermittent structures -- current sheets -- obtained from fully kinetic, two-dimensional simulations of relativistic plasma turbulence using unsupervised machine-learning data dissection. We find that the distribution functions of sheet length $\ell$ (longest scale of the analyzed structure in the direction perpendicular to the dominant guide field) and curvature $r_c$ (radius of a circle fitted to the structures) can be well-approximated by power-law distributions, indicating self-similarity of the structures. The distribution for the sheet width $w$ (shortest scale of the structure) peaks at the kinetic scales and decays exponentially at larger values. The data shows little or no correlation between $w$ and $\ell$, as expected from theoretical considerations. The typical $r_c$ depends linearly on $\ell$, which indicates that the sheets all have a similar curvature relative to their sizes. We find a weak correlation between $r_c$ and $w$. Our results can be used to inform realistic magnetohydrodynamic sub-grid models for plasma turbulence in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>FRB 20121102A monitoring: updated periodicity at L-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FRB 20121102A was the first fast radio burst to be observed to repeat. Since then, thousands of bursts have been detected by multiple radio telescopes around the world. Previous work has shown an indication of a cyclic activity level with a periodicity around 160 days. Knowing when the source repeats is essential for planning multi-wavelength monitoring to constrain their emission extend and progenitor source. We report the monitoring of FRB 20121102A using the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope at L-band and update the periodicity of the cyclic activity-level. We use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram on a sample of 272 observing epochs where 41% correspond to detections and 59% to non-detections. Our dataset is composed of the 7 epochs of our monitoring plus publicly available data. We investigate two methods, i) binary model, describing the observing epochs with 1 if there are detections and with 0 for non-detections. ii) normalised rates model: which considers the inferred detections rates. We report no detections in 12.5-hour observations down to a fluence of 0.29 Jy ms. The best period found for the cyclic activity window is $159.3 \pm 0.8$ days for the binary model and $159.3 \pm 0.3$ days for the normalised rates model. The activity phase is shown to be 53%. The normalised rates shows a clear Gaussian-like behaviour for the activity level, where the number of detections peak at the centre of the activity window. The periodicity found through both methods is consistent for the L and S-band datasets implying it is intrinsic to the source. The activity phase in S-band however shows an indication of it ending before the L-band activity phase, supporting the idea of chromatic dependence of the activity window. The sample at C-band however is not large enough to further confirm this result.</description>

      <title>Sizes and Stellar Masses of the Little Red Dots Imply Immense Stellar Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are red and compact galaxies detected in JWST deep fields, mainly in the redshift range $z=4-8$. Given their compactness and the inferred stellar masses in the hypothesis that LRDs are starburst galaxies, the implied stellar densities are immense. This Research Note uses an extensive catalog of LRDs from the PRIMER and the COSMOS-Web surveys to investigate these densities. We find a median (upper limit) on the effective radius of $80$ pc, which leads to median (lower limit) values of the core density of $\sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, and individual densities as high as $\sim 10^8 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, which is $\sim 10$ times higher than the density necessary for runaway collisions to take place. For $\sim 35\%$ of the LRDs investigated, the lower limits are higher than the highest stellar densities observed in any system in any redshift range.</description>

      <title>Average energy of the X-ray spectrum as a model-independent proxy for the mass of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature of the hot gas in galaxy clusters is known to be a reliable proxy for the their total gravitating mass, allowing one to use spectroscopic X-ray observations for halo mass function measurements. Data of shallow wide area surveys, however, often precludes direct fitting of the X-ray spectra, given possible biases arising due to unresolved (multitemperature) inner structure of the intracluster medium (ICM), projection effects and necessity of certain model assumptions to be made to allow for robust spectral fitting. We consider using a simple observable value - the average energy of the observed cluster X-ray spectrum - as a model-independent proxy for the ICM temperature, and consequently cluster's mass. We calibrate relation of this proxy to the cluster parameters using mock obsesrvations for a sample of 84 massive galaxy clusters extracted from the Magneticum cosmological hydro simulations. We consider observational parameters corresponding to the all-sky survey observations by SRG/eROSITA. Taking into account contributions of various background and foreground signals, average energy of the simulated X-ray spectra in the $0.4-7.0$ keV band is shown to be a stable indicator of the ICM temperature with $\sim10\%$ scatter and cluster's mass $M_{500}$ with a $\sim 20\%$ scatter. A database containing simulated X-ray images and their spectra (subtracted in several concentric rings) is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Global Preventive Feedback of Powerful Radio Jets on Galaxy Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firmly anchored on observational data, giant radio lobes from massive galaxies hosting supermassive black holes can exert a major negative feedback effect, by endowing the intergalactic gas with significant magnetic pressure hence retarding or preventing gas accretion onto less massive halos in the vicinity. Since massive galaxies that are largely responsible for producing the giant radio lobes, this effect is expected to be stronger in more overdense large-scale environments, such as proto-clusters, than in underdense regions, such as voids. We show that by redshift $z=2$ halos with masses up to $(10^{11-12}, 10^{12-13})\msun$ are significantly hindered from accreting gas due to this effect for radio bubble volume filling fraction of $(1.0, 0.2)$, respectively. Since the vast majority of the stars in the universe at $z&lt;2-3$ form precisely in those halos, this negative feedback process is likely one major culprit for causing the global downturn in star formation in the universe since. It also provides a natural explanation for the rather sudden flattening of the slope of the galaxy rest-frame UV luminosity function around $z\sim 2$. A cross-correlation between proto-clusters and Faraday rotation measures may test the predicted magnetic field. Inclusion of this external feedback process in the next generation of cosmological simulations may be imperative.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Production and Analytic Attenuation of Energetic MeV Solar Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a solar production mechanism of MeV dark matter to overcome the energy threshold in direct detection experiments. In particular, the proton and deuteron fussion to ${}^3 \mathrm{He}$ of the $pp$ chain that produces energetic neutrino and gamma photon with 5.5$\,$MeV of energy release can also produce a pair of dark matter particles. Besides, we establish an analytical formalism of using the Boltzmann equation to study the solar attenuation effect on the produced dark matter flux. The projected sensitivity is illustrated with Argon target at the DarkSide-LowMass experiment.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Recent progresses in strange quark stars</title>

Abstract: According to the hypothesis that strange quark matter may be the true ground state of matter at extremely high densities, strange quark stars should be stable and could exist in the Universe. It is possible that pulsars may actually be strange stars, but not neutron stars. Here we present a short review on recent progresses in the field of strange quark stars. First, three popular phenomenological models widely used to describe strange quark matter are introduced, with special attention being paid on the corresponding equation of state in each model. Combining the equation of state with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations, the inner structure and mass-radius relation can be obtained for the whole sequence of strange stars. Tidal deformability and oscillations (both radial and non-radial oscillations), which are sensitive to the composition and the equations of state, are then described. Hybrid stars as a special kind of quark stars are discussed. Several other interesting aspects of strange stars are also included. For example, strong gravitational wave emissions may be generated by strange stars through various mechanisms, which may help identify strange stars via observations. Especially, close-in strange quark planets with respect to their hosts may provide a unique test for the existence of strange quark objects. Fierce electromagnetic bursts could also be generated by strange stars. The energy may come from the phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars, or from the merger of binary strange stars. The collapse of the strange star crust can also release a huge amount of energy. It is shown that strange quark stars may be involved in short gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>High priority targets for transient gravitational waves from glitching pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glitching pulsars are expected to be important sources of gravitational waves. In this paper, we explore six different models that propose the emission of transient continuous waves, lasting days to months, coincident with glitches. The maximal gravitational wave energy is calculated for each model, which is then used to determine whether associated gravitational waves could be detectable with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O4 detectors. We provide an analytical approximation to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio which includes information about the source's sky position, improving on previous estimates that assume isotropic or sky and orientation averaged sensitivities. By analysing the entire glitching population, we find that certain models predict detectable signals in O4, whereas others do not. We also rank glitching pulsars by signal-to-noise ratio, based on archival data, and we find that for all models, the Vela pulsar (PSR J0835$-$4510) would provide the strongest signal. Moreover, PSR J0537$-$6910 is not expected to yield a detectable signal in O4, but will start becoming relevant for next generation detectors. Our analysis also extends to the entire pulsar population, regardless of whether they have glitched, and we provide a list of pulsars that would present a significant signal, if they were to glitch. Finally, we apply our analysis to the April 2024 Vela glitch and find that a signal should be detectable under certain models. The non-detection of a supposedly detectable signal would provide an efficiency factor that quantifies a model's contribution to gravitational wave emission, eventually leading to a differentiation of models and independent constraints on physical parameters.</description>

      <title>A proposed deep sea Neutrino Observatory in the Nanhai</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past ten years, several breakthroughs have been made in multi-messenger astronomy. Thanks to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the detection of astrophysical neutrinos was proved to be practical. However, no source has been significantly identified due to the lack of statistics and uncovered field of view. The next generation of high-energy neutrino telescope is in high demand. We propose the NEutrino Observatory in the Nanhai (NEON), located in the South China Sea to be complementary for the global neutrino detectors. This proposal describes the design and layout of the array and reports on comprehensive simulations conducted to assess its performance. The NEON project, with a volume of 10 km$^3$, achieves an angular resolution of 0.1$^\circ$ at 100 TeV. With 10 years of operation, the project's 5$\sigma$ sensitivity is estimated as $E^2\Phi \sim 2 \times 10^{-10}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for a source spectrum index of -2. We found that the variation in depth from 1700 to 3500 meters does not significantly influence the sensitivity to steady sources.</description>

      <title>Merging Hierarchical Triple Black Hole Systems with Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions suggest that very massive stars have the potential to form through multiple collisions and eventually evolve into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within Population III star clusters embedded in mini dark matter haloes. In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary fraction of $f_{\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code \textsc{petar}. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical triple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on their merging inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using the \textsc{tsunami} code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner BBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\odot}$, and as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\rm yr}^{-3}$. The orbital eccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically, known as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations. Detectable merging inner BBHs for mHz GW detectors LISA/TianQin/Taiji concentrate within $z&lt;3$. More distant sources would be detectable for CE/ET/LIGO/KAGRA/DECIGO, which are sensitive from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$Hz to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ Hz. Furthermore, compared with merging isolated BBHs, merging inner BBHs affected by dynamical perturbations from tertiary BHs tend to have higher eccentricities, with a significant fraction of sources with eccentricities closing to 1 at mHz bands. GW observations would help constrain formation channels of merging BBHs, whether through isolated evolution or dynamical interaction, by examining eccentricities.</description>

      <title>Constraining the abundance of spinning deformed Galactic compact objects with continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with non-zero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars), and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs, from searches in LIGO-Virgo data, have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count $N_{tot}$ of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an "agnostic" set of upper limits on $N_{tot}$ evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ have abundance upper limits at $90\%$ confidence, of $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 100$, and those with $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ have $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 10^4$. We additionally place upper-limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances $N_{tot}$.</description>
