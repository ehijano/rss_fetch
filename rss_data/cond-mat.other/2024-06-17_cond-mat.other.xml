      <title>Spin-deformation coupling in two-dimensional polar materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of the spin degree of freedom is at the heart of spintronics, which can potentially be achieved by spin-orbit coupling or band topological effects. In this paper, we explore another potential controlled mechanism under debate: the spin-deformation coupling (SDC) - the coupling between intrinsic or extrinsic geometrical deformations and the spin degree of freedom. We focus on polar-deformed thin films or two-dimensional compounds, where the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered as an $SU(2)$ non-Abelian gauge field. We demonstrate that the dynamics between surface and normal electronic degrees of freedom can be properly decoupled using the thin-layer approach by performing a suitable gauge transformation, as introduced in the context of many-body correlated systems. Our work leads to three significant results: (i) gauge invariance implies that the spin is uncoupled from the surface's extrinsic geometry, challenging the common consensus; (ii) the Rashba SOC on a curved surface can be included as an $SU(2)$ non-Abelian gauge field in curvilinear coordinates; and (iii) we identify a previously unnoticed scalar geometrical potential dependent on the Rashba SOC strength. This scalar potential, independent of spin, represents the residual effect remaining after decoupling the normal component of the non-Abelian gauge field. The outcomes of our work open novel pathways for exploring the manipulation of spin degrees of freedom through the use of the SDC.</description>

      <title>Applying Machine Learning to Elucidate Ultrafast Demagnetization Dynamics in Ni and Ni80Fe20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the correlation between fast and ultrafast demagnetization processes is crucial for elucidating the microscopic mechanisms underlying ultrafast demagnetization, which is pivotal for various applications in spintronics. Initial theoretical models attempted to establish this correlation but faced challenges due to the complex interplay of physical phenomena. To address this, we employed a variety of machine learning methods, including supervised learning regression algorithms and symbolic regression, to analyze limited experimental data and derive meaningful mathematical expressions between demagnetization time and the Gilbert damping factor. The results reveal that polynomial regression and K-nearest neighbors algorithms perform best in predicting demagnetization time. Additionally, sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator (SISSO) as a symbolic regression method suggested a direct correlation between demagnetization time and damping factor for Ni and Ni80Fe20, indicating spin-flip scattering predominantly influences the ultrafast demagnetization mechanism. The developed models demonstrate promising predictive capabilities, validated against independent experimental data. Comparative analysis between different materials underscores the significant impact of material properties on ultrafast demagnetization behavior. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in unraveling complex physical phenomena and offers valuable insights for future research in ultrafast magnetism.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Edge Correspondence Recovered in Incompressible Geophysical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence is a cornerstone in topological physics, establishing a connection between the number of unidirectional edge modes in physical space and a Chern number, an integer that counts phase singularities of the eigenmodes in parameter space. In continuous media, violation of this correspondence has been reported when some of the frequency wavebands are unbounded, resulting in weak topological protection of chiral edge states. Here, we propose a strategy to reestablish strong bulk-edge correspondence in incompressible rotating stratified flows, taking advantage of a natural cutoff frequency provided by density stratification. The key idea involves the introduction of an auxiliary field to handle the divergence-free constraint. This approach highlights the resilience of internal coastal Kelvin waves near vertical walls under varying boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with short- and long-range p-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with short-range, as well as long-range p-wave pairing. Here, the non-Hermiticity is introduced through the onsite potential. A comprehensive analysis of several critical aspects of this system is conducted, which includes eigenspectra, topological properties, localization properties, and the transition from real to complex energies. Specifically, we observe the emergence of Majorana zero modes in the case of short-range pairing, whereas massive Dirac modes emerge in the case of long-range pairing. More importantly, for the case of short-range pairing, we observe two simultaneous phase transitions or double phase transitions: topological and multifractal to localized phase. On the other hand, in the case of the long-range pairing, the topological and multifractal to localized transitions do not coincide. However, for both ranges of pairing, we identify a double phase transition where delocalized (or metallic) to a critical multifractal state is accompanied by an unconventional shift from real to complex energies. Unlike the short-range pairing case, we observe mobility edges in the long-range pairing case.</description>
