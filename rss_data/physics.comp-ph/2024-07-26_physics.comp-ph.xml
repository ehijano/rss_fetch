      <title>Inherent structural descriptors via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding proper collective variables for complex systems and processes is one of the most challenging tasks in simulations, which limits the interpretation of experimental and simulated data and the application of enhanced sampling techniques. Here, we propose a machine learning approach able to distill few, physically relevant variables by associating instantaneous configurations of the system to their corresponding inherent structures as defined in liquids theory. We apply this approach to the challenging case of structural transitions in nanoclusters, managing to characterize and explore the structural complexity of an experimentally relevant system constituted by 147 gold atoms. Our inherent-structure variables are shown to be effective at computing complex free-energy landscapes, transition rates, and at describing non-equilibrium melting and freezing processes. The effectiveness of this machine learning strategy guided by the generally-applicable concept of inherent structures shows promise to devise collective variables for a vast range of systems, including liquids, glasses, and proteins.</description>

      <title>Automated transport separation using the neural shifted proper orthogonal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network-based methodology for the decomposition of transport-dominated fields using the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (sPOD). Classical sPOD methods typically require an a priori knowledge of the transport operators to determine the co-moving fields. However, in many real-life problems, such knowledge is difficult or even impossible to obtain, limiting the applicability and benefits of the sPOD. To address this issue, our approach estimates both the transport and co-moving fields simultaneously using neural networks. This is achieved by training two sub-networks dedicated to learning the transports and the co-moving fields, respectively. Applications to synthetic data and a wildland fire model illustrate the capabilities and efficiency of this neural sPOD approach, demonstrating its ability to separate the different fields effectively.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Training of Grid-Dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a robust framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by approximating their solutions via neural networks and imposing physics-based constraints on the loss function. Traditionally, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are the neural network of choice, and significant progress has been made in optimizing their training. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were introduced as a viable alternative, with the potential of offering better interpretability and efficiency while requiring fewer parameters. In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs. We propose an adaptive training scheme for PIKANs, incorporating known MLP-based PINN techniques, introducing an adaptive state transition scheme to avoid loss function peaks between grid updates, and proposing a methodology for designing PIKANs with alternative basis functions. Through comparative experiments we demonstrate that these adaptive features significantly enhance training efficiency and solution accuracy. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of PIKANs in improving performance for PDE solutions, highlighting their potential as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-physics Simulation Guided Generative Diffusion Models with Applications in Fluid and Heat Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generic physics-informed generative model called MPDM that integrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with diffusion models. MPDM categorizes multi-fidelity physics simulations into inexpensive and expensive simulations, depending on computational costs. The inexpensive simulations, which can be obtained with low latency, directly inject contextual information into DDMs. Furthermore, when results from expensive simulations are available, MPDM refines the quality of generated samples via a guided diffusion process. This design separates the training of a denoising diffusion model from physics-informed conditional probability models, thus lending flexibility to practitioners. MPDM builds on Bayesian probabilistic models and is equipped with a theoretical guarantee that provides upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the sample and underlying true distribution. The probabilistic nature of MPDM also provides a convenient approach for uncertainty quantification in prediction. Our models excel in cases where physics simulations are imperfect and sometimes inaccessible. We use a numerical simulation in fluid dynamics and a case study in heat dynamics within laser-based metal powder deposition additive manufacturing to demonstrate how MPDM seamlessly integrates multi-idelity physics simulations and observations to obtain surrogates with superior predictive performance.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Imaging Framework Combining CNN and Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Full-Inverse Tomography: A Case Study in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a machine learning technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating PDEs as loss terms in neural networks and minimizing the loss function during training. Tomographic imaging, a method to reconstruct internal properties from external measurement data, is highly complex and ill-posed, making it an inverse problem. Recently, PINNs have shown significant potential in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and have advantages in solving inverse problems. However, existing research has primarily focused on semi-inverse Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), where internal electric potentials are accessible. The practical full inverse EIT problem, where only boundary voltage measurements are available, remains challenging. To address this, we propose a two-stage hybrid learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PINNs to solve the full inverse EIT problem. This framework integrates data-driven and model-driven approaches, combines supervised and unsupervised learning, and decouples the forward and inverse problems within the PINN framework in EIT. Stage I: a U-Net constructs an end-to-end mapping from boundary voltage measurements to the internal potential distribution using supervised learning. Stage II: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based PINN takes the predicted internal potentials as input to solve for the conductivity distribution through unsupervised learning.</description>

      <title>Interaction of driven "cold" electron plasma wave with thermal bulk mediated by spatial ion inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using high resolution Vlasov - Poisson simulations, evolution of driven ``cold" electron plasma wave (EPW) in the presence of stationary inhomogeneous background of ions is studied. Mode coupling dynamics between ``cold'' EPW with phase velocity $v_{\phi}$ greater than thermal velocity i.e $v_{\phi} \gg v_{thermal}$ and its inhomogeneity induced sidebands is illustrated as an initial value problem. In driven cases, formation of BGK like phase space structures corresponding to sideband modes due to energy exchange from primary mode to bulk particles via wave-wave and wave-particle interactions leading to particle trapping is demonstrated for inhomogeneous plasma. Qualitative comparison studies between initial value perturbation and driven problem is presented, which examines the relative difference in energy transfer time between the interacting modes. Effect of variation in background ion inhomogeneity amplitude as well as ion inhomogeneity scale length on the driven EPWs is reported.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear system related to investment under uncertainty solved using the fractional pseudo-Newton method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of two variables is numerically solved, which is derived from a nonlinear algebraic equation system of four variables, that corresponds to a mathematical model related to investment under conditions of uncertainty. The theory of investment under uncertainty scenarios proposes a model to determine when a producer must expand or close, depending on his income. The system mentioned above is solved using a fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional flow equations. A model for pressure deficit in an oil well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <title>Robust experimental data assimilation for the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a methodology focusing on the use of computational model and experimental data fusion to improve the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions. In particular, our goal is to develop a technique that not only assimilates sparse experimental data to improve turbulence model performance, but also preserves generalization for unseen cases by recovering classical SA behavior. We achieve our goals using data assimilation, namely the Ensemble Kalman filtering approach (EnKF), to calibrate the coefficients of the SA model for separated flows. A holistic calibration strategy is implemented via the parameterization of the production, diffusion, and destruction terms. This calibration relies on the assimilation of experimental data collected in the form of velocity profiles, skin friction, and pressure coefficients. Despite using observational data from a single flow condition around a backward-facing step (BFS), the recalibrated SA model demonstrates generalization to other separated flows, including cases such as the 2D NASA wall mounted hump (2D-WMH) and modified BFS. Significant improvement is observed in the quantities of interest, i.e., skin friction coefficient ($C_f$) and pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for each flow tested. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the newly proposed model recovers SA proficiency for flows, such as a NACA-0012 airfoil and axisymmetric jet (ASJ), and that the individually calibrated terms in the SA model target specific flow-physics wherein the calibrated production term improves the re-circulation zone while destruction improves the recovery zone.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exist an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Generalization of the Perdew-Zunger Self-Interaction Correction: a Way Out of Multiple Minima and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) is an established tool to correct unphysical behavior in density functional approximations. Yet, PZ-SIC is well-known to sometimes break molecular symmetries. An example of this is the benzene molecule, for which PZ-SIC predicts a symmetry-broken electron density and molecular geometry, since the method does not describe the two possible Kekul\'e structures on an even footing, leading to local minima [Lehtola et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3195]. PZ-SIC is often implemented with Fermi-L\"owdin orbitals (FLOs), yielding the FLO-SIC method, which likewise has issues with symmetry breaking and local minima [Trepte et al, J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 155, 224109].
  In this work, we propose a generalization of PZ-SIC - the ensemble PZ-SIC (E-PZ-SIC) method - which shares the asymptotic computational scaling of PZ-SIC (albeit with an additional prefactor). E-PZ-SIC is straightforwardly applicable to various molecules, merely requiring one to average the self-interaction correction over all possible Kekul\'e structures, in line with chemical intuition. We showcase the implementation of E-PZ-SIC with FLOs, as the resulting E-FLO-SIC method is easy to realize on top of an existing implementation of FLO-SIC. We show that E-FLO-SIC indeed eliminates symmetry breaking, reproducing a symmetric electron density and molecular geometry for benzene. The ensemble approach suggested herein could also be employed within approximate or locally scaled variants of PZ-SIC and their FLO-SIC versions.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhances the electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons for application in lithium-ion batteries: a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the electronic and diffusion properties of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for improving the performance of the fast-growing energy storage devices. Recently, fast-charging capability of commercial-like lithium-ion anodes with the least modification of the current manufactoring technology is of great interest. Here we use first principles methods with density functional theory and the climbing image-nudged elastic band method to evaluate the impact of an external electric field on the stability, electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons upon lithium adsorption. We show that by adsorbing a lithium atom, these semiconductor nanoribbons become metal with a formation energy of - 0.22 (eV). The lithium-ion mobility of this material is comparable to that of a common carbon graphite layer. Under a relatively small vertical electric field, the structural stability of these lithium-ion systems is even more stable, and their diffusion coefficient is enhanced significantly of ~719 times higher than that of the material in the absence of an applied electric field and ~521 times higher than in the case of commercial graphitic carbon layers. Our results highlight the role of an external electric field as a novel switch to improve the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries with penta-graphene nanoribbon electrodes and open a new horizon for the use of more environmentally friendly pentagonal materials as anode materials in lithium-ion battery industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light quark mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in-between of them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in-between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>
