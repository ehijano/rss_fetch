      <title>Invisible Labor, Visible Barriers: The Socioeconomic Realities of Women's Work in Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a short note on the barriers shaping womens economic opportunities in Pakistan, where female labor force participation remains among the lowest in the world. Recent labor force surveys (2020-21) show a sharp rural-urban divide: rural womens participation is 28 percent compared to 69 percent for rural men, while urban womens participation is 10 percent compared to 66 percent for urban men. Unemployment is higher for women in both rural (7 percent) and urban (16 percent) areas than for men (5 and 6 percent, respectively). Women are concentrated in agriculture (68 percent), with limited roles in services (17 percent) and industry (15 percent). Most are in rural (51 percent) or home-based (30 percent) work, and only 14 percent are in formal business settings. Employment status reflects high vulnerability, with 63 percent of rural women as unpaid contributing family workers compared to 17 percent of urban women. Interviews with women in Karachi highlight childcare responsibilities, harassment and safety risks, transport difficulties, and family opposition as major impediments.</description>

      <title>Cousin Marriage in Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the role of cousin marriage in shaping women's autonomy, household status, and labor supply in Pakistan. Existing research offers contradictory claims: some suggest that cousin marriage improves women's position within the household, while others argue it limits their freedoms and economic opportunities. Using data from 15,068 married women in the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, this study provides new quantitative evidence. Results indicate a modest negative association between cousin marriage and women's participation in paid work, alongside a stronger link to home-based and unpaid labor. Women in cousin marriages do not appear to gain household status relative to those in non-cousin marriages and are more likely to justify spousal violence, reflecting entrenched patriarchal norms. These findings suggest that cousin marriage may reinforce traditional gender roles and constrain women's economic and social autonomy.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Software Development in the IT Sector: Preliminary Findings on Productivity, Efficiency and Job Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of Generative AI on software development within the IT sector through a mixed-method approach, utilizing a survey developed based on expert interviews. The preliminary results of an ongoing survey offer early insights into how Generative AI reshapes personal productivity, organizational efficiency, adoption, business strategy and job insecurity. The findings reveal that 97% of IT workers use Generative AI tools, mainly ChatGPT. Participants report significant personal productivity gain and perceive organizational efficiency improvements that correlate positively with Generative AI adoption by their organizations (r = .470, p &lt; .05). However, increased organizational adoption of AI strongly correlates with heightened employee job security concerns (r = .549, p &lt; .001). Key adoption challenges include inaccurate outputs (64.2%), regulatory compliance issues (58.2%) and ethical concerns (52.2%). This research offers early empirical insights into Generative AI's economic and organizational implications.</description>

      <title>No evidence ageing or declining populations compromise socio-economic performance of countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerns about declining or ageing populations often centre on the fear that fewer people will translate to a weaker economy and lower living standards. But these fears are frequently based on oversimplified or misapplied interpretations of economic models, and appear to be driven more by political agendas rather than evidence. In reality, long-term prosperity depends more on how societies invest in education, skills, and technology, not just how many people they have. We examine national data at the global scale to test whether slower population growth or ageing populations are linked to worse economic or social outcomes. Using nine different indices of socio-economic performance (domestic comprehensive wealth, income equality, research and development expenditure, patent applications, human capital, corruption perception index, freedom, planetary pressure-adjusted Human Development Index, healthy life expectancy at birth), we find no evidence that they are. In fact, we find that countries with low or negative population growth perform better on average for all indicators, and that even within-country time series show that most older and slower-growing populations fare better on average. These findings challenge common assumptions and highlight the need to move beyond fear-based and politically motivated narratives toward a more informed understanding of what truly supports thriving societies.</description>

      <title>Integrative Experiments Identify How Punishment Impacts Welfare in Public Goods Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Punishment as a mechanism for promoting cooperation has been studied extensively for more than two decades, but its effectiveness remains a matter of dispute. Here, we examine how punishment's impact varies across cooperative settings through a large-scale integrative experiment. We vary 14 parameters that characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and collecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal striking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment consistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency) ranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely undermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To characterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human forecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in new experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed by contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs. all-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility (whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a reward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to influence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For example, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of punishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results refocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it "works" to the specific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our study demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine learning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions between multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex social phenomena.</description>

      <title>General Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Useful social science theories predict behavior across settings. However, applying a theory to make predictions in new settings is challenging: rarely can it be done without ad hoc modifications to account for setting-specific factors. We argue that modern AI agents offer an alternative for applying theory to novel settings, requiring minimal or no modifications. We present an approach for building such "general" agents that use theory-grounded natural language instructions, existing empirical data, and knowledge acquired by the underlying AI during training. To demonstrate the approach in settings where no data from that data-generating process exists--as is often the case in applied prediction problems--we design a highly heterogeneous population of 883,320 novel games. AI agents are constructed using human data from a small set of conceptually related, but structurally distinct "seed" games. In preregistered experiments, on average, agents predict human play better than (i) game-theoretic equilibria and (ii) out-of-the-box agents in a random sample of 1,500 games from the population. For a small set of separate novel games, these simulations predict responses from a new sample of human subjects better even than the most plausibly relevant published human data.</description>

      <title>Carbon Disclosure Effect, Corporate Fundamentals, and Net-zero Emission Target: Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to China's national carbon neutrality goals, this study examines how corporate carbon emissions disclosure affects the financial performance of Chinese A-share listed companies. Leveraging artificial intelligence tools, including natural language processing, we analyzed emissions disclosures for 4,336 companies from 2017 to 2022. The research demonstrates that high-quality carbon disclosure positively impacts financial performance with higher stock returns, improved return on equity, increased Tobin's Q ratio, and reduced stock price volatility. Our findings underscore the emerging importance of carbon transparency in financial markets, highlighting how environmental reporting can serve as a strategic mechanism to create corporate value and adapt to climate change.</description>

      <title>Revisiting H\"otte (2025): A Companion Analysis with Extended Evidence from UK Inter-Industry Payment Data, 2017-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2025, the UK Office for National Statistics released a novel dataset of monthly inter-industry payment flows during January 2017 to November 2024 at the 5-digit SIC level (ONS, 2025a), covering $&gt;$3.1 million UK organizations. Annual aggregates amount to 490 million transactions with an aggregate value of over {\pounds}3.1 trillion in 2023. Such publicly available data are unprecedented by their granularity and timeliness, providing a rich basis for economic research and real-time policy advice. H\"otte (2025) provided an empirical validation supplemented with conceptual discussions for using such bottom-up collected data in macroeconomic, industry-level, and economic network studies based on an earlier non-public and smaller version of the data. The novel data features much greater coverage, along with several methodological improvements. This paper gives an update on the earlier empirical results. It summarizes the major methodological changes of data construction, discusses key empirical observations, and their differences and consistencies relative to H\"otte (2025). It concludes by discussing the implications for using payment data and outlining remaining challenges and expected future developments.</description>

      <title>A Model of Triple-Channel Interaction Dynamics in Pharmaceutical Retailing in Emerging Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The survival of unorganized pharmacies is increasingly challenging in the face of growing competition from organized and e-pharmaceutical retail channels in emerging economies. A theoretical model is developed to capture the triple-channel interactions among unorganized, organized and e-retailing in emerging markets, taking into account the essential features of the pharmaceutical retail landscape, consumers, retailers and pharmaceutical products. Given the retailer and customer-specific factors, the price-setting game between the triple-channel retailers yielded the optimal prices for these retailers. The analysis found that the product category level demand has no influence on optimal pricing strategies of the retailers. The analysis also reveals counterintuitive results, for instance, (i) an increase in customer acceptance of unorganized retailers will result in a decrease in profits of both unorganized and organized retailers; (ii) as the distance and transportation cost to unorganized retailers increases for the consumers, the profit of the unorganized retailer increases; and (iii) consumers marginal utility of money has no influence on the optimal price, but have an influence on the profit of the three retail channels. Our research findings offer valuable insights for policymakers facing challenges in achieving a balanced growth among the organized, unorganized, and e-pharmaceutical retail sectors in emerging economies.

      <title>Robust Market Making: To Quote, or not To Quote</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market making is a popular trading strategy, which aims to generate profit from the spread between the quotes posted at either side of the market. It has been shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement learning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to lead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting throughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for ``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the market rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with increasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask quotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes, refuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a model-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the continuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of adversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of well-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to 99.9$\%$ in some cases.</description>

      <title>ARL-Based Multi-Action Market Making with Hawkes Processes and Variable Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance market-making strategies by integrating Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (ARL), Hawkes Processes, and variable volatility levels while also expanding the action space available to market makers (MMs). To enhance the adaptability and robustness of these strategies -- which can quote always, quote only on one side of the market or not quote at all -- we shift from the commonly used Poisson process to the Hawkes process, which better captures real market dynamics and self-exciting behaviors. We then train and evaluate strategies under volatility levels of 2 and 200. Our findings show that the 4-action MM trained in a low-volatility environment effectively adapts to high-volatility conditions, maintaining stable performance and providing two-sided quotes at least 92\% of the time. This indicates that incorporating flexible quoting mechanisms and realistic market simulations significantly enhances the effectiveness of market-making strategies.</description>

      <title>Making AI Inevitable: Historical Perspective and the Problems of Predicting Long-Term Technological Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the extent to which prominent debates about the future of AI are best understood as subjective, philosophical disagreements over the history and future of technological change rather than as objective, material disagreements over the technologies themselves. It focuses on the deep disagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove transformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that of whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study begins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of these can be identified as "transformationalists," who argue that continued AI development will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them are "skeptics," a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or will live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further "strong" and "weak" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized contrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps' respective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular are focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate time frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of technological development. In highlighting these specific points of non-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different arguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position. At the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the transformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates competitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen the concept of "expertise" in debates surrounding the future development of AI.</description>

      <title>Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in combinatorial auctions is designing bid formats that accurately capture agents' preferences while remaining computationally feasible. This is especially true for electricity auctions, where complex preferences complicate straightforward solutions. In this context, we examine the XOR package bid, the default choice in combinatorial auctions and adopted in European day-ahead and intraday auctions under the name "exclusive group of block bids". Unlike parametric bid formats often employed in US power auctions, XOR package bids are technology-agnostic, making them particularly suitable for emerging demand-side participants. However, the challenge with package bids is that auctioneers must limit their number to maintain computational feasibility. As a result, agents are constrained in expressing their preferences, potentially lowering their surplus and reducing overall welfare. To address this issue, we propose decision support algorithms that optimize package bid selection, evaluate welfare losses resulting from bid limits, and explore alternative bid formats. In our analysis, we leverage the fact that electricity prices are often fairly predictable and, at least in European auctions, tend to approximate equilibrium prices reasonably well. Our findings offer actionable insights for both auctioneers and bidders.</description>

Abstract: Although AI has the potential to drive significant business innovation, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We examine how the Lean Startup Method (LSM) influences the impact of AI on product innovation in startups. Analyzing data from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts by the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies with strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our study reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with effectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We differentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel areas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes existing processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between prototyping focused on developing minimum viable products, and controlled experimentation, focused on rigorous testing such as AB testing. We find that LSM complements discovery oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for market opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities, thereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first release of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by using AB testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI to streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the improvement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI and LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high quality product in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware development, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous construct, as different AI capabilities require distinct organizational processes to achieve optimal outcomes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism with a Quantitative Trade Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23341</link>

Abstract: We analyze the economic and environmental impacts of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) using a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model with input-output linkages. We quantify the general equilibrium responses of trade flows, welfare, and emissions. To our knowledge, we developed the first quantitative trade model that jointly endogenizes both the Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowance and the CBAM prices. We find that CBAM marginally increases EU Gross National Expenditure (GNE) and shifts trade toward more domestic and cleaner production. Emissions embodied in direct EU imports fall by 4.8%, and by 3% when including indirect emissions -- underscoring the importance of accounting for production networks in evaluating policy outcomes.</description>

      <title>Incorporating an economic approach to production in a health system model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11730</link>

Abstract: As computational capacity increases, it becomes possible to model health systems in greater detail. Multi-disease health system models (HSMs) represent a new development, building on individual level epidemiological models of multiple diseases and capturing how healthcare delivery systems respond to population health needs. The Thanzi la Onse (TLO) model of Malawi is the first of its kind in these respects. In this article, we discuss how we have been bringing economic concepts into the TLO model, and how we are continuing to develop this line of research. This has involved incorporating more sophisticated approaches to account for the effects of the unavailability of healthcare workers, and we are working towards establishing the role of different forms of ownership of healthcare facilities and different management practices. Not only does this broad approach make the model more flexible as a tool for understanding the impact of resource constraints, it opens up the possibility of analysing considerably richer policy scenarios; for example establishing an estimate of the health gain that could be achieved through expanding the workforce or reducing healthcare worker absence.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of Climate transition on real estate prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model to quantify the impact of the climate transition on a property in housing market. We begin by noting that property is an asset in an economy. That economy is organized in sectors, driven by its productivity which is a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the climate transition is declined thanks to the carbon price, a continuous deterministic process. We then extend the sales comparison approach and the income approach to valuate an energy inefficient real estate asset. We obtain its value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs (before and after the renovation date). These costs are due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal renovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Moreover, since the renovation increases the efficiency of the building, which is random, the future additional energy costs become smaller and even zero if the optimal energy efficiency is reached. Finally, we carry out simulations based on the French economy and the house price index of France. The findings support the conclusion that the order of magnitude of the depreciation obtained by our model is the same as the empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Assignment at the Frontier: Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome equals a frontier function of inputs minus a nonnegative unobserved deviation. We allow the deviation's distribution to depend on inputs, thereby allowing for endogeneity. If zero lies in the support of the deviation given inputs -- an assumption we term assignment at the frontier -- then the frontier is identified by the supremum of the outcome at those inputs, obviating the need for instrumental variables. We then estimate the frontier, allowing for random error whose distribution may also depend on inputs. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the mean deviation, using only variance and skewness, that is robust to a scarcity of data near the frontier. We apply our methods to estimate a firm-level frontier production function and mean inefficiency.</description>
