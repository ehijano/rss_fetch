      <title>Convexity of Optimization Curves: Local Sharp Thresholds, Robustness Impossibility, and New Counterexamples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when the \emph{optimization curve} of first-order methods -- the sequence \${f(x\_n)}*{n\ge0}\$ produced by constant-stepsize iterations -- is convex, equivalently when the forward differences \$f(x\_n)-f(x*{n+1})\$ are nonincreasing. For gradient descent (GD) on convex \$L\$-smooth functions, the curve is convex for all stepsizes \$\eta \le 1.75/L\$, and this threshold is tight. Moreover, gradient norms are nonincreasing for all \$\eta \le 2/L\$, and in continuous time (gradient flow) the curve is always convex. These results complement and refine the classical smooth convex optimization toolbox, connecting discrete and continuous dynamics as well as worst-case analyses.</description>

      <title>Regularization in Data-driven Predictive Control: A Convex Relaxation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the role of regularization in data-driven predictive control (DDPC) through the lens of convex relaxation. Using a bi-level optimization framework, we model system identification as an inner problem and predictive control as an outer problem. Within this framework, we show that several regularized DDPC formulations, including l1-norm penalties, projection-based regularizers, and a newly introduced causality-based regularizer, can be viewed as convex relaxations of their respective bi-level problems. This perspective clarifies the conceptual links between direct and indirect data-driven control and highlights how regularization implicitly enforces system identification. We further propose an optimality-based variant, O-DDPC, which approximately solves the inner problem with all identification constraints via an iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that O-DDPC outperforms existing regularized DDPC by reducing both bias and variance errors. These results indicate that further benefits may be obtained by applying system identification techniques to pre-process the trajectory library in nonlinear settings. Overall, our analysis contributes to a unified convex relaxation view of regularization in DDPC and sheds light on its strong empirical performance beyond linear time-invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Strategies for Infectious Diseases: A Multi-Objective Framework with an Interactive Dashboard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During an infectious disease outbreak, policymakers must balance medical costs with social and economic burdens and seek interventions that minimize both. To support this decision-making process, we developed a framework that integrates multi-objective optimization, cost-benefit analysis, and an interactive dashboard. This platform enables users to input cost parameters and immediately obtain a cost-optimal intervention strategy. We applied this framework to the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea. The results showed that cost-optimal solutions for costs per infection ranging from 4,410 USD to 361,000 USD exhibited a similar pattern. This indicates that once the cost per infection is specified, our approach generates the corresponding cost-optimal solution without additional calculations. Our framework supports decision-making by accounting for trade-offs between policy and infection costs. It delivers rapid optimization and cost-benefit analysis results, enabling timely and informed decision-making during the critical phases of a pandemic.</description>

      <title>Partial Eigenvalue Assignment for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study control design methods for assigning a subset of nonlinear right or left eigenvalues to a specified set of scalar-valued functions via nonlinear Sylvester equations. This framework can be viewed as a generalization of partial linear eigenvalue assignment (also referred to as partial pole placement) for linear systems. First, we propose a method for partial nonlinear right eigenvalue assignment via state feedback using a nonlinear Sylvester equation and a condition for preserving an open-loop nonlinear right eigenvalue. This method can be applied to partial stabilization of nonlinear systems. Then, as the dual problem, we present a method for partial nonlinear left eigenvalue assignment via the dual nonlinear Sylvester equation and a condition for preserving an open-loop nonlinear left eigenvalue, which can be applied to partial observer design for nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>The role of communication delays in the optimal control of spatially invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal proportional feedback controllers for spatially invariant systems when the controller has access to delayed state measurements received from different spatial locations. We analyze how delays affect the spatial locality of the optimal feedback gain leveraging the problem decoupling in the spatial frequency domain. For the cases of expensive control and small delay, we provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for infinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive control regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware filtering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free setting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the delay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our analytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a multi-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays reduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each subsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away locations.</description>

      <title>A $\sqrt{2}$-accelerated FISTA for composite strongly convex problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel accelerated forward-backward splitting algorithm for minimizing convex composite functions, written as the sum of a smooth function and a (possibly) nonsmooth function. When the objective function is strongly convex, the method attains, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate, yielding a simultaneous linear and sublinear nonasymptotic bound. Our convergence analysis remains valid even when one of the two terms is only weakly convex (while the sum remains convex). The algorithm is derived by discretizing a continuous-time model of the Information-Theoretic Exact Method (ITEM), which is the optimal method for unconstrained strongly convex minimization.</description>

      <title>A note on quantifying the contributions of incidence functions in spatio-temporal epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial feature of reaction-diffusion epidemic models is the incidence function, which characterizes disease transmission dynamics. Over the past few decades, many studies have investigated the behavior of such models under various incidence functions. However, the question of how to appropriately select a suitable incidence function remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this issue by proposing an intuitive theoretical framework that recasts the original problem as determining the contributions of different incidence functions to the dynamics based on given observations. Specifically, the choice of an incidence function is linked to a weight assigned to it. Mathematically, this leads to a PDE-constrained optimization problem, where the objective is to identify the weights of a convex combination of multiple incidence functions that best approximate the experimental observations generated by the model. We first establish the Fr\'echet differentiability of the parameter-to-state operator and then derive the optimality conditions for the weights using a suitable adjoint problem. Finally, we illustrate our approach with a numerical example based on the Landweber iteration algorithm.</description>

      <title>Turnpike properties for zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic differential games of Markovian regime switching system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the long-time behavior of zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic (SLQ) differential games within Markov regime-switching diffusion systems and establishes the turnpike property of the optimal triple. By verifying the convergence of the associated coupled differential Riccati equations (CDREs) along with their convergence rate, we show that, for a sufficiently large time horizon, the equilibrium strategy in the finite-horizon problem can be closely approximated by that of the infinite-horizon problem. Furthermore, this study enhances and extends existing results concerning zero-sum SLQ differential games over both finite and infinite horizons.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned third-order implicit-explicit algorithm with a difference of varying convex functions and extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel preconditioned implicit-explicit algorithm enhanced with the extrapolation technique for non-convex optimization problems. The algorithm employs a third-order Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear and explicit parts and a third-order backward differentiation formula for the implicit part of the gradient flow in variational functions. The proposed algorithm, akin to a generalized difference-of-convex (DC) approach, employs a changing set of convex functions in each iteration. Under the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) properties, the global convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed, ensuring that it converges within a finite number of preconditioned iterations. Our numerical experiments, including least squares problems with SCAD regularization and the graphical Ginzburg-Landau model, demonstrate the proposed algorithm's highly efficient performance compared to conventional DC algorithms.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Fixed Pole Information in the Data-Driven Least Squares Realization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical least squares realization problems, partial information about the poles of the dynamical model may be known a priori. Existing techniques for incorporating prior knowledge, such as prefiltering the given data, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical guarantees. We extend our previously developed globally optimal approach for the least squares realization problem to accommodate fixed poles. In particular, we reformulate the problem as a (rectangular) multiparameter eigenvalue problem, the eigenvalues of which characterize all local and global minimizers of the constrained estimation problem. We present numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and experimentally validate this letter's central hypothesis: incorporating a priori information on the poles enhances the estimation results.</description>

      <title>Unsteady gas dynamics modeling for leakage detection in parallel pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel analytical framework for modeling unsteady gas dynamics in parallel pipeline systems under leakage conditions. The proposed method introduces a time-dependent leakage mass flow rate function, which dynamically captures the temporal decay of leakage based on real-time inlet pressure measurements. This functional form allows for a more physically consistent and mathematically tractable representation of gas loss compared to conventional constant-rate or stepwise models. The pipeline system is partitioned into three regions relative to the leakage point, and closed-form pressure solutions are derived using Laplace transform techniques. These expressions enable direct estimation of the leakage location through inverse pressure profiles, eliminating the need for computationally intensive iterative schemes. The analytical model is further validated against representative benchmark scenarios, demonstrating good agreement with literature-based results. A comparative analysis underscores the model's ability to localize leakage using minimal sensor data while preserving interpretability - an essential feature for deployment in industrial environments. The approach provides a lightweight yet robust alternative to purely numerical or machine learning-based solutions and offers potential integration into real-time monitoring systems. This work contributes to the field by unifying gas dynamic principles, sensor-assisted modeling, and analytical solution strategies to enhance the reliability and speed of leak detection in modern gas transport infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Corruption-Tolerant Asynchronous Q-Learning with Near-Optimal Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted, infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption, the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning, bridging a significant gap in robust RL.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an SIR Model with Noncompliance as a Social Contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a compartmental model for epidemiology with human behavioral effects. Specifically, our model incorporates governmental prevention measures aimed at lowering the disease infection rate, but we split the population into those who comply with the measures and those who do not comply and therefore do not receive the reduction in infectivity. We then allow the attitude of noncompliance to spread as a social contagion parallel to the disease. We derive the reproductive ratio for our model and provide stability analysis for the disease-free equilibria. We then propose a control scenario wherein a policy-maker with access to control variables representing disease prevention mandates, treatment efforts, and educational campaigns aimed at encouraging compliance minimizes a cost functional incorporating several cost concerns. We characterize optimal controls via the Pontryagin optimality principle and present simulations which demonstrate the behavior of the control maps in several different parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>A New Algorithm for Computing Integer Hulls of 2D Polyhedral Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\texttt{IntegerHull}$ function is part of Maple's $\texttt{PolyhedralSets}$ library, which calculates the integer hull of a given polyhedral set. This algorithm works by translating the supporting hyperplanes of the facets of the input polyhedral set inwards till each hyperplane encounters at least one integer point. The polyhedral set is then divided into smaller regions and a brute force method is applied to find the remaining vertices.
  There are certain edge case scenarios where the computational cost of the existing algorithm can be high, for which we propose a new algorithm. We translate the supporting hyperplanes of the facets inwards from the (relative) opposite vertex till the hyperplanes encounter at least one integer point. Then, we can follow the same procedure as the old algorithm or use a recursive technique on the smaller regions.
  The edge case scenarios mentioned above occurs when there are integer points present on the supporting hyperplanes of the facets of the polyhedral set. This increases the region on which the brute force method is applied to find the remaining vertices.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Guarantees and Hardness Results for MNL-Driven Product Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address open computational questions regarding the market share ranking problem, recently introduced by Derakhshan et al. (2022). Their modelling framework incorporates the extremely popular Multinomial Logit (MNL) choice model, along with a novel search-based consider-then-choose paradigm. In a nutshell, the authors devised a Pandora's-Box-type search model, where different customer segments sequentially screen through a ranked list of products, one position after the other, forming their consideration set by including all products viewed up until terminating their inspection procedure. Subsequently, a purchasing decision out of this set is made based on a joint MNL choice model.
  Our main contribution consists in devising a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the market share ranking problem, utilizing fresh technical developments and analytical ideas, in conjunction with revising the original insights of Derakhshan et al. (2022). Along the way, we introduce a black-box reduction, mapping general instances of the market share ranking problem into ``bounded ratio'' instances, showing that this result directly leads to an elegant and easily-implementable quasi-PTAS. Finally, to provide a complete computational characterization, we prove that the market share ranking problem is strongly $\mathrm{NP}$-hard.</description>

Abstract: Topology optimization is a valuable tool in engineering, facilitating the design of optimized structures. However, topological changes often require a remeshing step, which can become challenging. In this work, we propose an isogeometric approach to topology optimization driven by topological derivatives. The combination of a level-set method together with an immersed isogeometric framework allows seamless geometry updates without the necessity of remeshing. At the same time, topological derivatives provide topological modifications without the need to define initial holes [7]. We investigate the influence of higher-degree basis functions in both the level-set representation and the approximation of the solution. Two numerical examples demonstrate the proposed approach, showing that employing higher-degree basis functions for approximating the solution improves accuracy, while linear basis functions remain sufficient for the level-set function representation.</description>

      <title>Bioluminescence tomography: A new regularized shape optimization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an inverse source problem arising in bioluminescence tomography (BLT), where the objective is to recover both the support and intensity of the light source from boundary measurements. A shape optimization framework is developed, in which the source strength and its support are decoupled through first-order optimality conditions. To enhance the stability of the reconstruction, we incorporate a parameter-dependent coupled complex boundary method(CCBM) scheme together with perimeter and volume regularizations. The level-set representation naturally accommodates topological changes, enabling the reconstruction of multiple, closely located, or nested sources. Theoretical justifications are provided, and a series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and noise-resistance of the algorithm, as well as its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Variance Reduced Extra-Point Approach to Finite-Sum VI and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop stochastic variance reduced algorithms for solving a class of finite-sum hemivariational inequality (HVI) problem. In this HVI problem, the associated function is assumed to be differentiable, and both the vector mapping and the function are of finite-sum structure. We propose two algorithms to solve the cases when the vector mapping is either merely monotone or strongly monotone, while the function is assumed to be convex. We show how to apply variance reduction in the proposed algorithms when such an HVI problem has a finite-sum structure, and the resulting accelerated gradient complexities can match the best bound established for finite-sum VI problem, as well as the bound given by the direct Katyusha for finite-sum optimization respectively, in terms of the corresponding parameters such as (gradient) Lipschitz constants and the sizes of the finite-sums. We demonstrate the application of our algorithms through solving a finite-sum constrained finite-sum optimization problem and provide preliminary numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider a weighted mean-field control problem with jump-diffusion as its state process. The main difficulty is from the non-Lipschitz property of the coefficients. We overcome this difficulty by an $L_{p,q}$-estimate of the solution processes with a suitably chosen $p$ and $q$. Convex pertubation method combining with the aforementioned $L_{p,q}$-estimation method is utilized to derive the stochastic maximum principle for this control problem. A sufficient condition for the optimality is also given.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Distributionally Robust Optimization via Data Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an online data compression approach for efficiently solving distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems with streaming data while maintaining out-of-sample performance guarantees. Our method dynamically constructs ambiguity sets using online clustering, allowing the clustered configuration to evolve over time for an accurate representation of the underlying distribution. We establish theoretical conditions for clustering algorithms to ensure robustness, and show that the performance gap between our online solution and the nominal DRO solution can be written in terms of the distance between the true and compressed distributions. Therefore, by varying the number of clusters, our method effectively balances robustness and online computational efficiency. We show that our analysis is compatible with well-established finite-sample and asymptotic guarantees for Wasserstein DRO. Numerical experiments in mixed-integer portfolio optimization demonstrate significant computational savings, with minimal loss in solution quality.</description>

      <title>Beyond separability: convergence rate of vanishing viscosity approximations to mean field games via FBSDE stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the vanishing viscosity approximation to mean field games (MFGs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonlocal and possibly non-separable Hamiltonian. We prove that the value function converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\beta)$, where $\beta^2$ is the diffusivity constant, which matches the classical convergence rate of vanishing viscosity for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. The same rate is also obtained for the approximation of the distribution of players as well as for the gradient of the value function. The proof is a combination of probabilistic and analytical arguments by first analyzing the forward-backward stochastic differential equation associated with the MFG, and then applying a general stability result for HJ equations. Applications of our result to $N$-player games, mean field control, and policy iteration for solving MFGs are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a systematic solution method for optimal stopping problems of one-dimensional spectrally negative \lev processes. Our approach relies essentially on the potential theory, in particular the Riesz decomposition and the maximum principle. Using these mathematical results, we not only identify and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality for a broad class of reward functions, but also present a method to tackle general problems in a direct and constructive way (without pre-specifying the solution form). To reinforce the latter point, we provide a step-by-step solution procedure, which is applicable to complex solution structures including multiple double-sided continuation regions.</description>

      <title>Worst-case convergence analysis of relatively inexact gradient descent on smooth convex functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical gradient descent algorithm with constant stepsizes, where some error is introduced in the computation of each gradient. More specifically, we assume some relative bound on the inexactness, in the sense that the norm of the difference between the true gradient and its approximate value is bounded by a certain fraction of the gradient norm. This paper presents a worst-case convergence analysis of this so-called relatively inexact gradient descent on smooth convex functions, using the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework. We first derive the exact worst-case behavior of the method after one step. Then we study the case of several steps and provide computable upper and lower bounds using the PEP framework. Finally, we discuss the optimal choice of constant stepsize according to the obtained worst-case convergence rates.</description>

Abstract: We study the connection between cyclic quasi-monotonicity and quasi-convexity, focusing on whether every cyclically quasi-monotone (possibly multivalued) map is included in the normal cone operator of a quasi-convex function, in analogy with Rockafellar's theorem for convex functions. We provide a positive answer for $\mathscr{C}^1$-regular, non-vanishing maps in any dimension, as well as for general multi-maps in dimension $1$. We further discuss connections to revealed preference theory in economics and to $L^\infty$ optimal transport. Finally, we present explicit constructions and examples, highlighting the main challenges that arise in the general case.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Convergence Rate Bound for Gradient Based Online Optimization Algorithms with Exact Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider algorithms with integral action for solving online optimization problems characterized by quadratic cost functions with a time-varying optimal point described by an $(n-1)$th order polynomial. Using a version of the internal model principle, the optimization algorithms under consideration are required to incorporate a discrete time $n$-th order integrator in order to achieve exact tracking. By using results on an optimal gain margin problem, we obtain a fundamental convergence rate bound for the class of linear gradient based algorithms exactly tracking a time-varying optimal point. This convergence rate bound is given by $ \left(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa} - 1 }{\sqrt{\kappa} + 1}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number for the set of cost functions under consideration. Using our approach, we also construct algorithms which achieve the optimal convergence rate as well as zero steady-state error when tracking a time-varying optimal point.</description>

      <title>Lipschitzianity of expected value under decision-dependent uncertainty with moving support</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of stochastic optimization with decision-dependent uncertainty, a class of problems where the probability distribution of the uncertain parameters is influenced by the decision-maker's actions. While recent literature primarily focuses on solving or analyzing these problems by directly imposing hypotheses on the distribution mapping, in this work we explore some of these properties for a specific construction by means of the moving support and a density function. The construction is motivated by the Bayesian approach to bilevel programming, where the response of a follower is modeled as the uncertainty, drawn from the moving set of optimal responses which depends on the leader's decision. Our main contribution is to establish sufficient conditions for the Lipschitz continuity of the expected value function. We show that Lipschitz continuity can be achieved when the moving support is a Lipschitz continuous set-valued map with full-dimensional, convex, compact values, or when it is the solution set of a fully linear parametric problem. We also provide an example showing that the sole Lipschitz assumption on the moving set itself is not sufficient and that additional conditions are necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to extract alternative solutions for optimization problems solved by Benders Decomposition. In practice, alternative solutions provide useful insights for complex applications; some solvers do support generation of alternative solutions but none appear to support such generation when using Benders Decomposition. We propose a new post-processing method that extracts multiple optimal and near-optimal solutions using the cut-pool generated during Benders Decomposition. Further, we provide a geometric framework for understanding how the adaptive approximation in Benders Decomposition relates to alternative solutions. We demonstrate this technique on stochastic programming and interdiction modeling, and we highlight use cases that require the ability to enumerate all optimal solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of defining meaningful upper and lower quantization dimensions for a compactly supported Borel probability measure of order $r$, including negative values of $r$. To this end, we use the concept of partition functions, which generalizes the idea of the $L^{q}$-spectrum and in this way naturally extends the work in [M. Kesseb\"ohmer, A. Niemann, and S. Zhu. Quantization dimensions of probability measures via R\'enyi dimensions. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 376.7 (2023)]. In particular, we provide natural fractal geometric bounds as well as easily verifiable necessary conditions for the existence of the quantization dimensions. The exact asymptotics of the quantization error of negative order for absolutely continuous measures are stated, whereby an open question from [S. Graf, H. Luschgy. Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 136, 3 (2004)] regarding the geometric mean error is also answered in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Tannenbaum's gain-margin optimization meets Polyak's heavy-ball algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper highlights an apparent, yet relatively unknown link, between algorithm design in optimization theory and control synthesis in robust control. Specifically, quadratic optimization can be recast as a regulation problem within the frame of $H_\infty$ control. From this vantage point, the optimality of Polyak's fastest heavy-ball algorithm can be ascertained as a solution to a gain margin optimization problem. The approach is independent of Polyak's original and brilliant argument, and relies on foundational work by Tannenbaum who introduced and solved gain margin optimization via Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theory. The link between first-order optimization methods and robust control sheds new light into the limits of algorithmic performance of such methods, and suggests a framework where similar computational tasks can be systematically studied and algorithms optimized. In particular, it raises the question as to whether periodically scheduled algorithms can achieve faster rates for quadratic optimization, in a manner analogous to periodic control that extends gain margin beyond that of time-invariant control. This turns out not to be the case, due to the analytic obstruction of a transmission zero that is inherent in causal schemes. Interestingly, this obstruction can be removed with implicit algorithms, cast as feedback regulation problems with causal, but not strictly causal dynamics, thereby devoid of the transmission zero at infinity and able to achieve superior convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Communication Compression for Distributed Learning without Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning algorithms, such as the ones employed in Federated Learning (FL), require communication compression to reduce the cost of client uploads. The compression methods used in practice are often biased, making error feedback necessary both to achieve convergence under aggressive compression and to provide theoretical convergence guarantees. However, error feedback requires client-specific control variates, creating two key challenges: it violates privacy-preserving principles and demands stateful clients. In this paper, we propose Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), a novel distributed learning framework that allows highly compressible client updates by exploiting past aggregated updates, and does not require control variates. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results confirm that CAFe outperforms existing distributed learning compression schemes.</description>
