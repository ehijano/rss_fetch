      <title>New theoretical instability regions and pulsational masses for blue large-amplitude pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered group of hot pulsating stars whose evolutionary status remains uncertain. We study the pulsation characteristics of BLAPs for the two main mass scenarios, $ 0.3 - 0.4 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ and $ 0.7 - 1.1 \: \rm M_{\odot} $, and compare them with observations to find evidence for either scenario. We compute about a half million linear BLAP models using MESA-RSP and compare the linear pulsation periods with the observed ranges of BLAP stars. For the low-mass scenario, BLAPs are in a region of the HR diagram where the growth rates are positive for the fundamental mode, and the model periods correspond well to the observed ones, assuming the reported luminosities of $ \sim 200 \: \rm L_{\odot} $. For the high-mass scenario, pulsations in the first overtone dominate. Assuming a larger range of luminosities, high-mass models could also explain all BLAPs, including the high-gravity BLAPs. Furthermore, we provide the first seismically constrained mass estimate for the first double-mode BLAP star, OGLE-BLAP-030. We find that a linear model with a mass of $ 0.62 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ matches the reported parameters of this star exactly, placing it in between the two mass scenarios. We also derive new period relations based on our models and all available observed BLAPs, and we find that the derived relations also support the low-mass scenario.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Pore Rotation Associated with a C-class Flare from Spectropolarimetric Observations with DKIST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution observations of a C4.1-class solar flare (SOL2023-05-03T20:53) in AR 13293 from the ViSP and VBI instruments at the DKIST. The fast cadence, good resolution, and high polarimetric sensitivity of ViSP data provide a unique opportunity to explore the photospheric magnetic fields before and during the flare. We infer the magnetic field vector in the photosphere from the Fe I 6302 line using Milne-Eddington inversions. Combined analysis of the inverted data and VBI images reveals the presence of two oppositely-polarity pores exhibiting rotational motion both prior to and throughout the flare event. Data-driven simulations further reveal a complex magnetic field topology above the rotating pores, including a null-point-like configuration. We observed a 30% relative change in the horizontal component ($\delta F_h$) of Lorentz force at the flare peak time and roughly no change in the radial component. We find that the changes in $\delta F_h$ are the most likely driver of the observed pore rotation. These findings collectively suggest that the back-reaction of magnetic field line reconfiguration in the corona may influence the magnetic morphology and rotation of pores in the photosphere on a significantly smaller scale.</description>

      <title>Periodic Coronal Rain Driven by Self-consistent Heating Process in a Radiative Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic coronal rain and in-phase radiative intensity pulsations have been observed in multiple wavelengths in recent years. However, due to the lack of three-dimensional coronal magnetic fields and thermodynamic data in observations, it remains challenging to quantify the coronal heating rate that drives the mass cycles. In this work, based on the MURaM code, we conduct a three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation spanning from the convective zone to the corona, where the solar atmosphere is heated self-consistently through dissipation resulting from magneto-convection. For the first time, we model the periodic coronal rain in an active region. With a high spatial resolution, the simulation well resembles the observational features across different extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. These include the realistic interweaving coronal loops, periodic coronal rain and periodic intensity pulsations, with two periods of 3.0~h and 3.7~h identified within one loop system. Moreover, the simulation allows for a detailed three-dimensional depiction of coronal rain on small scales, revealing adjacent shower-like rain clumps $\sim500$~km in width and showcasing their multi-thermal internal structures. We further reveal that these periodic variations essentially reflect the cyclic energy evolution of the coronal loop under thermal non-equilibrium state. Importantly, as the driver of the mass circulation, the self-consistent coronal heating rate is considerably complex in time and space, with hour-level variations in one order of magnitude, minute-level bursts, and varying asymmetry reaching ten times between footpoints. This provides an instructive template for the ad hoc heating function, and further enhances our understanding of the coronal heating process.</description>

      <title>Millimetre observations of the S-type AGB star $\chi$ Cygni: variability of the emission of the inner envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New observations are presented of millimetre line emissions of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of AGB star $\chi$ Cygni using the recently upgraded NOEMA array. $\chi$ Cygni is an S-type Mira variable, at the border between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, that has been observed for over 40 years to display features giving evidence for the strong role played by pulsation-associated shock waves in the generation of its wind. The new observations give evidence for a bright H$^{12}$CN(3-2) line emission confined to the very close neighbourhood of the star, however significantly more extended in 2024 than in 2023. Interpretation of such variability in terms of maser emission is considered but found to raise significant unanswered questions. Moreover, other unexpected features are observed in the very close neighbourhood of the star, including low Si$^{16}$O(6-5)/Si$^{17}$O(6-5), $^{28}$SiO(5-4)/$^{29}$SiO(5-4) and $^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1) line emission ratios. Possibly confirming the important role played by shocks, we discuss a measurement of the SiO(5-4)/SiO(6-5) emission ratio, evidence for a recent mass ejection particularly enhanced in the north-western red-shifted octant of the circumstellar envelope, leaving a depression of emission in its wake, and patterns of enhanced CO(2-1) line-emission suggesting an interpretation in terms of episodic outflows enhanced over solid angles associated with the surface of convective cells and on a time scale of a few decades. Unravelling the mechanisms underlying such newly observed features is very challenging and confirmation of the reported observations with improved sensitivity and angular resolution would be highly welcome. Observation of SiO maser emission in the ($\nu$=1,$J$=6-5) transition is reported for the first time.</description>

      <title>BSN: The First Light Curve Analysis of the Total Eclipse Binary System EL Tuc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted the first light curve study of the binary star EL Tuc within the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project framework. The photometric observations were made using standard multiband BVRI filters at an observatory in Argentina. We presented a new ephemeris for EL Tuc and a linear fit to the O-C diagram, utilizing our extracted times of minima and additional literature. We employed the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for the system's light curve analysis. The target system's light curve solution required a cold starspot on the hotter component. We conclude that EL Tuc is a total contact binary system with a low mass ratio of q=0.172+_0.002, an orbital inclination of i=83.74+_0.40 degree, and a fillout factor of f=53.7+_1.6%. We used the P-a relationship and the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) parallax method to determine the absolute parameters of EL Tuc to compare the precision of our results. This system was classified as W-type based on the mass and effective temperature of the companion stars. The positions of the systems were depicted on the M-L, M-R, T-M, and q-L_ratio diagrams. The relationship between the spectroscopic and photometric mass ratios of binaries was discussed.</description>

      <title>First Solar Orbiter observation of a dark halo in the solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) are often surrounded by dark large areas of reduced emission compared to the quiet Sun, observed at various wavelengths corresponding to chromosphere, transition region (TR) and corona, and known as Dark Halos (DHs). DHs have been insufficiently studied, and the mechanisms behind their darker emission remain unclear. This study aims to investigate for the first time the fine structure of a DH observed by the EUV High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{EUV}$) onboard the ESA's Solar Orbiter (SO) mission and its appearance in the TR. We utilized the extensive 1-hour dataset from SO on 19 March 2022, which includes high-resolution observations of NOAA 12967 and part of the surrounding DH. We analyzed the dynamics of the HRI$_{EUV}$ DH fine structure and its appearance in the HRI$_{Ly\alpha}$ image and the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) Ly$\beta$, C III, N VI, O VI and Ne VIII lines, which sample the TR in the logT (K) $\sim$ 4.0 - 5.8 range. This analysis was complemented with a simultaneous B$_{LOS}$ magnetogram taken by the High Resolution Telescope (HRT). We report the presence of a peculiar fine structure which is not observed in the quiet Sun, characterized by combined bright EUV bundles and dark regions, arranged and interconnected in such a way that they cannot be clearly separated. They form a spatial continuum extending approximately radially from the AR core, suggesting a deep connection between the DH and the AR. Additionally, we find that the bright EUV bundles are observed in all the SPICE TR lines and the HRI$_{Ly\alpha}$ band and present photospheric B$_{LOS}$ footprints in the HRT magnetogram. This spatial correlation indicates that the origin of the 174 \r{A} DH may lie in the low atmosphere, i.e. photosphere/chromosphere.</description>

      <title>High-resolution observations of recurrent jets from an arch filament system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar jets are collimated plasma ejections along magnetic field lines observed in hot (EUV jets) and cool (chromospheric surges) temperature diagnostics. Their trigger mechanisms and the relationship between hot and cool jets are still not completely understood. We aim to investigate the generation of a sequence of active region solar jets and their evolution from the photospheric to the coronal heights. Using the synergy of high spatial and temporal resolution observations by the SST, along with the SDO, we analyze a sequence of solar jets originating in a mixed polarity region between the leading and following sunspots of an active region. We use a NFFF extrapolation technique for deriving the magnetic field topology of the active region. A mixed polarity region is formed over a long period (24 hours) with persistent magnetic flux emergence. This region has been observed as an arch filament system (AFS) in chromospheric SST observations. In this region, negative polarities surrounded by positive polarities create a fan-surface with a null point at a height of 6 Mm detected in the NFFF extrapolation. SST observations in H-beta spectral line reveal a large flux rope over the AFS and moving from the North to South, causing successive EUV and cool jets to move in the East-West direction and later towards the South along the long open loops. The high resolution SST observations (0.038 arcsec per pixel) resolve the dark area observed at the jet base and reveal the existence of an AFS with an extended cool jet which may be the result of a peeling-like mechanism of the AFS. Based on the combined analysis of SST and AIA observations along with extrapolated magnetic topology, it is suggested that the magnetic reconnection site may move southward by approximately 20 Mm until it reaches a region where the open magnetic field lines are oriented North-South.</description>

      <title>Virtual EVE: a Deep Learning Model for Solar Irradiance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding space weather is vital for the protection of our terrestrial and space infrastructure. In order to predict space weather accurately, large amounts of data are required, particularly in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum. An exquisite source of information for such data is provided by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), which has been gathering solar measurements for the past 13 years. However, after a malfunction in 2014 affecting the onboard Multiple EUV Grating Spectrograph A (MEGS-A) instrument, the scientific output in terms of EUV measurements has been significantly degraded. Building upon existing research, we propose to utilize deep learning for the virtualization of the defective instrument. Our architecture features a linear component and a convolutional neural network (CNN) -- with EfficientNet as a backbone. The architecture utilizes as input grayscale images of the Sun at multiple frequencies -- provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) -- as well as solar magnetograms produced by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Our findings highlight how AIA data are all that is needed for accurate predictions of solar irradiance. Additionally, our model constitutes an improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art in the field, further promoting the idea of deep learning as a viable option for the virtualization of scientific instruments.</description>

      <title>A false positive transit candidate for EPIC 211101996 from K2 and TESS data identified as background eclipsing binary Gaia DR3 66767847894609792</title>

Abstract: Transiting planets around young stars are hard to find due to the enhanced stellar activity. Only a few transiting planets have been detected around stars younger than 100 Myr. We initially detected a transit-like signal in the K2 light curve of a very cool M dwarf star (EPIC 211101996) in the Pleiades open cluster, with an estimated age of about 100 Myr. Our detailed analysis of the per-pixel light curves, detrending with the W\={o}tan software and transit search with the Transit Least Squares algorithm showed that the source of the signal is a contaminant source (Gaia DR3 66767847894609792) 20" west of the target. The V-like shape of its phase-folded light curve and eclipse depth of ~15% suggest that it is a grazing eclipsing binary. The contaminant has hitherto been listed as a single star, which we now identify as an eclipsing stellar binary with a period of about 6 days.</description>

      <title>The MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White Dwarfs (MEOW) Survey: Mid-Infrared Excess Reveals a Giant Planet Candidate around a Nearby White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey is a cycle 2 JWST program to search for exoplanets around dozens of nearby white dwarfs via infrared excess and direct imaging. In this paper, we present the detection of mid-infrared excess at 18 and 21 microns towards the bright (V = 11.4) metal-polluted white dwarf WD 0310-688. The source of the IR excess is almost certainly within the system; the probability of background contamination is $&lt;0.1\%$. While the IR excess could be due to an unprecedentedly small and cold debris disk, it is best explained by a $3.0^{+5.5}_{-1.9}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ cold (248$^{+84}_{-61}$ K) giant planet orbiting the white dwarf within the forbidden zone (the region where planets are expected to be destroyed during the star's red giant phase). We constrain the source of the IR excess to an orbital separation of 0.1-2 AU, marking the first discovery of a white dwarf planet candidate within this range of separations. WD 0310-688 is a young remnant of an A or late B-type star, and at just 10.4 pc it is now the closest white dwarf with a known planet candidate. Future JWST observations could distinguish the two scenarios by either detecting or ruling out spectral features indicative of a planet atmosphere.</description>

      <title>HighSpec: A High-Resolution Spectrograph for the MAST Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the updated design of HighSpec, a high-resolution $\mathcal{R} \sim 20,000$ spectrograph designed for the Multi Aperture Spectroscopic Telescope (MAST). HighSpec offers three observing modes centered at the Ca II H&amp;K, Mg b triplet, and H$\alpha$ lines. Each mode is supported by a highly optimized ion-etched grating, contributing to an exceptional instrument peak efficiency of $\gtrsim85\%$ for the two latter bands ($\gtrsim55\%$ for the Ca II H&amp;K band). Optimizing throughput over wavelength coverage ($\Delta \lambda=10-17$ nm), HighSpec enables the precise measurement of spectral lines from faint targets. This approach is especially relevant for stellar object studies, specifically of WDs, which are intrinsically faint and have few spectroscopic lines. Each observing mode was tailored to target spectral features essential for WD research. Its integration with MAST, an array of 20 custom-designed telescopes that can function as a single large telescope (equivalent to a $2.7$ m telescope in collecting area) or multiplexing over the entire sky, provides unique adaptability for extensive and effective spectroscopic campaigns. Currently in its final assembly and testing stages, HighSpec's on-sky commissioning is scheduled for 2025.</description>

      <title>The cosmic rate of Pair-Instability Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) have crucial implications for many astrophysical topics, including the search for very massive stars, the black hole mass spectrum, and galaxy chemical enrichment. To this end, we need to understand where PISNe are across cosmic time, and what are their favourable galactic environments. We present a new determination of the PISN rate as a function of redshift, obtained by combining up-to-date stellar evolution tracks from the PARSEC and FRANEC codes, with an up-to-date semi-empirical determination of the star formation rate and metallicity evolution of star-forming galaxies throughout cosmic history. We find the PISN rate to exhibit a huge dependence on the model assumptions, including the criterion to identify stars unstable to pair production, and the upper limit of the stellar initial mass function. Remarkably, the interplay between the maximum metallicity at which stars explode as PISNe, and the dispersion of the galaxy metallicity distribution, dominates the uncertainties, causing a $\sim$ seven-orders-of-magnitude PISN rate range. Furthermore, we show a comparison with the core-collapse supernova rate, and study the properties of the favourable PISN host galaxies. According to our results, the main contribution to the PISN rate comes from metallicities between $\sim 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$, against the common assumption that views very-low-metallicity, Population III stars as exclusive or dominant PISN progenitors. The strong dependencies we find offer the opportunity to constrain stellar and galaxy evolution models based on possible future (or the lack of) PISN observations.</description>

      <title>gaspery: Optimized Scheduling of Radial Velocity Follow-Up Observations for Active Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial velocity (RV) follow-up is a critical complement of transiting exoplanet surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ), both for validating discoveries of exoplanets and measuring their masses. Stellar activity introduces challenges to interpreting these measurements because the noise from the host star, which is often correlated in time, can result in high RV uncertainty. A robust understanding of stellar activity and how its timescales interact with the observing cadence can optimize limited RV resources. For this reason, in the era of over-subscribed, high-precision RV measurements, folding stellar activity timescales into the scheduling of observation campaigns is ideal. We present gaspery, an open-source code implementation to enable the optimization of RV observing strategies. Gaspery employs a generalized formulation of the Fisher Information for RV time series that also incorporates information about stellar correlated noise. We show that the information contained in an observing strategy can be significantly affected by beat frequencies between the orbital period of the planet, the stellar rotation period, and the observation epochs. We investigate how the follow-up observing strategy will affect the resulting radial velocity uncertainty, as a function of stellar properties such as the spot decay timescale and rotation period. We then describe two example use cases for gaspery: 1) calculating the minimum number of observations to reach an uncertainty tolerance in a correlated noise regime and 2) finding an optimal strategy given a fixed observing budget. Finally, we outline a prescription for selecting an observing strategy that is generalizable to different targets.</description>

      <title>Excitation and spatial study of a prestellar cluster towards G+0.693-0.027 in the Galactic centre</title>

Abstract: Star formation in the central molecular zone (CMZ) is suppressed with respect to that of the Galactic disk, and this is likely related to its high turbulent environment. This turbulence impedes the potential detection of prestellar cores. We present the temperature, density, and spatial structure of the CMZ molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, which has been proposed to host a prestellar cluster in the Sgr B2 region. We analysed multiple HC$_{3}$N rotational transitions that were observed with the IRAM 30m, APEX, Yebes 40m, and GBT radio telescopes, together with SMA+APEX spatially resolved maps. The spectral shape of HC$_{3}$N lines shows three velocity components: a broad component with a line width of 23 km s$^{-1}$ (C1), and two narrow components with line widths of 7.2 and 8.8 km s$^{-1}$ (C2 and C3). This suggests that a fraction of the molecular gas in this cloud is undergoing turbulence dissipation. From a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis we have found H$_{2}$ densities of 2$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, 5$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, and 4$\times$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and kinetic temperatures of 140 K, 30 K, and 80 K for C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The spatially resolved maps confirm that the colder and high-density condensations C2 and C3, which peak in the 70-85 km s$^{-1}$ velocity range, are embedded in a more diffuse and warmer gas (C1). The larger-scale structure of the Sgr B2 region shows a hole at 40-50 km s$^{-1}$ that is likely due to a small cloud that shocked the Sgr B2 region and is spatially related with a massive cloud at 60-80 km s$^{-1}$. We propose that the impacting small cloud sequentially triggered the formation of Sgr B2(M), (N), and (S) and the condensations in G+0.693-0.027 during its passage. Based on the analysis of the masses of the two condensations and on the virial parameters, C2 might expand, while C3 might further fragment or collapse.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Telluric Features and Stellar Variability with StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant barrier to achieving the radial velocity (RV) measurement accuracy and precision required to characterize terrestrial mass exoplanets is the existence of time-variable features in the measured spectra, from both telluric absorption and stellar variability, which affect measured line shapes and can cause apparent RV shifts. Reaching the desired accuracy using traditional techniques often requires avoiding lines contaminated by stellar variability and/or changing tellurics, and thus discarding a large fraction of the spectrum, lowering precision. New data-driven methods can help achieve extremely precise and accurate RVs by enabling the use of a larger fraction of the available data. While there exist methods for modeling telluric features or the stellar variability individually, there is a need for additional tools that are capable of modeling them simultaneously at the spectral level. Here we present StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl (SSOF), a Julia package for measuring Doppler shifts and creating data-driven models (with fast, physically-motivated Gaussian Process regularization) for the time-variable spectral features for both the telluric transmission and stellar spectrum, while accounting for the wavelength-dependent instrumental line-spread function. We demonstrate SSOF's state-of-the-art performance on data from the NEID RV spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope for multiple stars. We show SSOF's, ability to accurately identify and characterize spectral variability and provide $\sim$2-6x smaller photon-limited errors over the NEID CCF-based pipeline and match the performance of SERVAL, a leading template-based pipeline, using only observed EPRV spectra.</description>

      <title>Mapping radial abundance gradients with Gaia-ESO open clusters: Evidence of recent gas accretion in the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent evidences from spectroscopic surveys point towards the presence of a metal-poor, young stellar population in the chemical thin disk. In this context, the investigation of the spatial distribution and time evolution of precise, unbiased abundances is fundamental to disentangle the scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. Aims. We study the evolution of abundance gradients in the Milky Way by taking advantage of a large sample of open clusters, which are among the best tracers for this purpose. In particular, we use data from the last release of the Gaia-ESO survey. Methods. We perform careful selection of open cluster stars excluding those that may be affected by biases in spectral analysis. The cleaned open clusters sample is compared with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, using well tested stellar yields and prescription for radial migration. Different scenarios of Galaxy evolution are tested to explain the data, i.e. the two-infall and the three-infall frameworks, suggesting that the chemical thin disk is formed by one or two subsequent gas accretion episodes, respectively. Results. With the performed selection in cluster stars, we still find a metallicity decrease between intermediate age (1&lt;Age/Gyr&lt;3) and young (Age&lt;1Gyr) open clusters. This decrease cannot be explained in the context of the two-infall scenario, even by accounting for the effect of migration and yield prescriptions. The three-infall model, with its late gas accretion in the last 3 Gyr, can explain the low metallic content in young clusters. However, we invoke a milder metal dilution relative to previous findings. Conclusions. To explain the observed low metallic content in young clusters, we propose that a late gas accretion episode triggering metal dilution should have taken place, extending the framework of the three-infall model for the first time to the entire Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Shocking and Mass Loss of Compact Donor Stars in Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion. Following the explosion, the surviving donor star leaves at roughly its orbital velocity. The discovery of the runaway helium subdwarf star US 708, and seven hypervelocity stars from Gaia data, all with spatial velocities $\gtrsim 900$ km/s, strongly support a scenario in which the donor is a low-mass helium star, or a white dwarf. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the $\texttt{Athena++}$ code modeling the hydrodynamical interaction between a helium star or helium white dwarf, and the supernova ejecta. We find that $\approx 0.01-0.02\,M_{\odot}$ of donor material is stripped, and explain the location of the stripped material within the expanding supernova ejecta. We continue the post-explosion evolution of the shocked donor stars with the $\texttt{MESA}$ code. As a result of entropy deposition, they remain luminous and expanded for $\approx 10^{5}-10^{6}$ yrs. We show that the post-explosion properties of our helium white dwarf donor agree reasonably with one of the best-studied hypervelocity stars, D6-2.</description>

      <title>Two of a Kind: Comparing big and small black holes in binaries with gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: When modeling the population of merging binary black holes, analyses have generally focused on characterizing the distribution of primary (i.e. more massive) black holes in the binary, while simplistic prescriptions are used for the distribution of secondary masses. However, the secondary mass distribution and its relationship to the primary mass distribution provide a fundamental observational constraint on the formation history of coalescing binary black holes. If both black holes experience similar stellar evolutionary processes prior to collapse, as might be expected in dynamical formation channels, the primary and secondary mass distributions would show similar features. If they follow distinct evolutionary pathways (for example, due to binary interactions that break symmetry between the initially more massive and less massive star), their mass distributions may differ. We present the first analysis of the binary black hole population that explicitly fits for the secondary mass distribution. We find that the data is consistent with a $\sim30\,M_{\odot}$ peak existing only in the distribution of \emph{secondary} rather than primary masses. This would have major implications for our understanding of the formation of these binaries. Alternatively, the data is consistent with the peak existing in both component mass distributions, a possibility not included in most other previous studies. In either case, the peak is observed at $31.4_{-2.6}^{+2.3}\,M_{\odot}$, which is shifted lower than the value obtained in previous analyses of the marginal primary mass distribution, placing this feature in further tension with expectations from a pulsational pair-instability supernova pileup.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VI: Radial abundance gradients of 29 chemical species in the Milky Way Disk</title>

Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are crucial for calibrating the extragalactic distance ladder, ultimately enabling the determination of the Hubble constant through the PL and PW relations they exhibit. Hence it's vital to understand how the PL and PW relations depend on metallicity. This is the purpose of the C-MetaLL survey within which this work is situated. DCEPs are also very important tracers of the young populations placed along the Galactic disc. We aim to enlarge the sample of DCEPs with accurate abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy. Our goal is to extend the range of measured metallicities towards the metal-poor regime to better cover the parameter space. We observed objects in a wide range of Galactocentric radii, allowing us to study in detail the abundance gradients present in the Galactic disc. We present the results of the analysis of 331 spectra obtained for 180 individual DCEPs with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. We derived accurate atmospheric parameters, radial velocities, and abundances for up to 29 different species. The iron abundances range between 0.5 and -1 dex with a rather homogeneous distribution in metallicity. The sample presented in this paper was complemented with that already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey, resulting in a total of 292 pulsators whose spectra have been analysed in a homogeneous way. These data were used to study the abundance gradients of the Galactic disc in a range of Galactocentric radii spanning the range 5-20 kpc. For most of the elements we found a clear negative gradient, with a slope of -0.071\pm0.003 dex kpc^-1 for [Fe/H] case. Through a qualitative fit with the Galactic spiral arms we shown how our farthest targets (R_GC&gt;10 kpc) trace both the Outer and OSC arms. The homogeneity of the sample will be of pivotal importance for the study of the metallicity dependance of the DCEP PL relations.</description>

Abstract: The high-energy radiative output, from the X-ray to the ultraviolet, of exoplanet host stars drives photochemical reactions and mass loss in the upper regions of planetary atmospheres. In order to place constraints on the atmospheric properties of the three closest terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs, we observe the high-energy spectra of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486 in the X-ray with XMM-Newton and Chandra and in the ultraviolet with HST/COS and STIS. We combine these observations with estimates of extreme ultraviolet flux, reconstructions of the Ly-a lines, and stellar models at optical and infrared wavelengths to produce panchromatic spectra from 1A--20um for each star. While LTT1445Ab, LTT1445Ac, and GJ486b do not possess primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, we calculate that they are able to retain pure CO2 atmospheres if starting with 10, 15, and 50% of Earth's total CO2 budget, respectively, in the presence of their host stars' stellar wind. We use age-activity relationships to place lower limits of 2.2 and 6.6 Gyr on the ages of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486. Despite both LTT1445A and GJ486 appearing inactive at optical wavelengths, we detect flares at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths for both stars. In particular, GJ486 exhibits two flares with absolute energies of 10^29.5 and 10^30.1 erg (equivalent durations of 4357+/-96 and 19724+/-169 s) occurring three hours apart, captured with HST/COS G130M. Based on the timing of the observations, we suggest that these high-energy flares are related and indicative of heightened flaring activity that lasts for a period of days, but our interpretations are limited by sparse time-sampling. Consistent high-energy monitoring is needed to determine the duration and extent of high-energy activity on individual M dwarfs, as well as the population as a whole.</description>

      <title>Search for MeV Gamma-ray emission from TeV bright red dwarfs with COMPTEL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SHALON atmospheric Cherenkov telescope has detected very high energy gamma-ray emission at TeV energies from eight red dwarfs, namely, V388 Cas, V547 Cas, V780 Tau, V962 Tau, V1589 Cyg, GJ 1078, GJ 3684 and GL 851.1. Consequently, these red dwarfs have been suggested as sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this work, we search for soft gamma-ray emission from these TeV bright red dwarfs between 0.75-30 MeV using archival data from the COMPTEL gamma-ray imaging telescope, as a follow-up to a similar search for GeV gamma-ray emission using the Fermi-LAT telescope. Although, prima-facie, we detect non-zero photon flux from three red dwarfs with high significance, these signals can attributed to contamination from nearby sources such as Crab and Cygnus, which are within the angular resolution of COMPTEL, and have been previously detected as very bright point sources at MeV energies. Therefore, we could not detect any statistically significant signal ($&gt;3\sigma$) from any of these eight red dwarfs from 0.75-30 MeV. We then report the 95% confidence level upper limits on the differential photon flux (at 30 MeV), integral photon flux and integral energy flux for all of the eight red dwarfs. The integral energy flux limits range between $10^{-11}-10^{-10} \rm{ergs/cm^2/s}$.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- A near-IR multi-mode spectrograph conceived for MORFEO@ELT</title>

Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>

Abstract: Stellar ages are an important parameter to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In recent years, several studies have established the existence of a relationship between chemical clocks and stellar ages. The [Y/Mg] clock is a promising technique, but there are still several open questions, such as its validity for metal-poor stars and differences between the thin and thick disk populations. Our aim is to study the behaviour of the [Y/Mg] chemical clock with stellar ages and the effect of metallicity and population on this chemical clock for a sample of solar-type disk stars. We have derived the precise stellar atmospheric parameters as well as the elemental abundances of Mg and Y through line-by-line differential spectroscopic analysis for a sample of 48 metal-poor solar-type stars based on high-quality, high-resolution ESO/HARPS spectra. From the high-precision Gaia astrometric data, stellar masses and ages were estimated through isochrone-fitting. A joint analysis of our sample, together with a sample of 185 solar-twins and analogues from our previous works, is performed to calibrate the [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic disk for $-$0.71 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $&lt;$ +0.34. Open clusters and stars with asteroseismic ages have been used to validate our relations. Two different populations could be clearly seen in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane - the thick and thin disks. We found a metallicity-dependent, strong anti-correlation between the [Y/Mg] ratio and stellar ages of our sample. For the first time in the literature, we report similar correlations for the thin and thick disk stars. The [Y/Mg] relation(s) found here for solar-type stars is compatible with the literature using solar-twins. Our relation provides higher accuracy and precision of 0.45 and 0.99 Gyr, respectively, comparable with the best accuracy achieved for the solar-twins till date.</description>
