      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for SAR Interferometric Phase Unwrapping: A Theoretical Framework for Energy-Efficient Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data, propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.</description>

      <title>Brain2Model Transfer: Training sensory and decision models with human neural activity as a teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding. Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1) Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely artificial training.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantum Spiking Neural Networks with Quantum Memory and Local Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation, consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand, leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Assessing an evolutionary search engine for small language models, prompts, and evaluation metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g., instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI interaction patterns.</description>

      <title>Efficient Event-based Delay Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) compute using sparse communication and are attracting increased attention as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks~(ANNs). While standard ANNs are stateless, spiking neurons are stateful and hence intrinsically recurrent, making them well-suited for spatio-temporal tasks. However, the duration of this intrinsic memory is limited by synaptic and membrane time constants. Delays are a powerful additional mechanism and, in this paper, we propose a novel event-based training method for SNNs with delays, grounded in the EventProp formalism which enables the calculation of exact gradients with respect to weights and delays. Our method supports multiple spikes per neuron and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first delay learning algorithm to be applied to recurrent SNNs. We evaluate our method on a simple sequence detection task, as well as the Yin-Yang, Spiking Heidelberg Digits, Spiking Speech Commands and Braille letter reading datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm can optimise delays from suboptimal initial conditions and enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without delays. We also find that recurrent delays are particularly beneficial in small networks. Finally, we show that our approach uses less than half the memory of the current state-of-the-art delay-learning method and is up to 26x faster.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm with Innovative Chromosome Patterns in the Breeding Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes Genetic Algorithm with Border Trades (GAB), a novel modification of the standard genetic algorithm that enhances exploration by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process. This approach significantly mitigates premature convergence and improves search diversity. Empirically, GAB achieves up to 8x higher fitness and 10x faster convergence on complex job scheduling problems compared to standard Genetic Algorithms, reaching average fitness scores of 888 versus 106 in under 20 seconds. On the classic Flip-Flop problem, GAB consistently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions in fewer generations, even as input sizes scale to thousands of bits. These results highlight GAB as a highly effective and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</description>
