      <title>In-Sample and Out-of-Sample Sharpe Ratios for Linear Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how much the in-sample performance of trading strategies based on linear predictive models is reduced out-of-sample due to overfitting. More specifically, we compute the in- and out-of-sample means and variances of the corresponding PnLs and use these to derive a closed-form approximation for the corresponding Sharpe ratios. We find that the out-of-sample ``replication ratio'' diminishes for complex strategies with many assets and based on many weak rather than a few strong trading signals, and increases when more training data is used. The substantial quantitative importance of these effects is illustrated with an empirical case study for commodity futures following the methodology of Garleanu-Pedersen.</description>

      <title>Market Making with Fads, Informed, and Uninformed Traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the solutions to a continuous-time optimal liquidity provision problem in a market populated by informed and uninformed traders. In our model, the asset price exhibits fads -- these are short-term deviations from the fundamental value of the asset. Conditional on the value of the fad, we model how informed traders and uninformed traders arrive in the market. The market maker knows of the two groups of traders but only observes the anonymous order arrivals. We study both, the complete information and the partial information versions of the control problem faced by the market maker. In such frameworks, we characterise the value of information, and we find the price of liquidity as a function of the proportion of informed traders in the market. Lastly, for the partial information setup, we explore how to go beyond the Kalman-Bucy filter to extract information about the fad from the market arrivals.</description>

      <title>Rough volatility, path-dependent PDEs and weak rates of convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the setting of stochastic Volterra equations, and in particular rough volatility models, we show that conditional expectations are the unique classical solutions to path-dependent PDEs. The latter arise from the functional It\^o formula developed by [Viens, F., &amp; Zhang, J. (2019). A martingale approach for fractional Brownian motions and related path dependent PDEs. Ann. Appl. Probab.]. We then leverage these tools to study weak rates of convergence for discretised stochastic integrals of smooth functions of a Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (0,1/2)$. These integrals approximate log-stock prices in rough volatility models. We obtain the optimal weak error rates of order~$1$ if the test function is quadratic and of order~$(3H+1/2)\wedge 1$ if the test function is five times differentiable; in particular these conditions are independent of the value of~$H$.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.</description>
