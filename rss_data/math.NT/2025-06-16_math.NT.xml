      <title>\'Etale algebras and the Kummer theory of finite Galois modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galois cohomology groups $H^i(K,M)$ are widely used in algebraic number theory, in such contexts as Selmer groups of elliptic curves, Brauer groups of fields, class field theory, and Iwasawa theory. The standard construction of these groups involves maps out of the absolute Galois group $G_K$, which in many cases of interest (e.g. $K = \mathbb{Q}$) is too large for computation or even for gaining an intuitive grasp. However, for finite $M$, an element of $H^i(K,M)$ can be described by a finite amount of data. For the important case $i = 1$, the appropriate object is an \'etale algebra over $K$ (a finite product of separable field extensions) whose Galois group is a subgroup of the semidirect product $\operatorname{Hol} M = M \rtimes \operatorname{Aut} M$ (often called the \emph{holomorph} of $M$), equipped with a little bit of combinatorial data.
  Although the correspondence between $H^1$ and field extensions is in widespread use, it includes some combinatorial and Galois-theoretic details that seem never to have been written down. In this short quasi-expository paper, we fill in this gap and explain how the \'etale algebra perspective illuminates some common uses of $H^1$, including parametrizing cubic and quartic algebras as well as computing the Tate pairing on Galois coclasses of local fields.</description>

      <title>On the intervals for the non-existence of covering systems with distinct moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a research seminar in $2006$, M. Filaseta, O. Trifonov, and G. Yu showed for each integer $n\geq3$ there is no distinct covering with all moduli in the interval $[n, 6n]$. In $2022$, this interval was subsequently improved to $[n, 8n]$ by the first author and O. Trifonov. The first author then improved this bound to $[n, 9n]$ in $2023$. Building off their method, we show that for each integer $n\geq 3$, there does not exist a distinct covering system with all moduli in the interval $[n, 10n]$.</description>

      <title>A survey of The Prouhet-Tarry-Escott Problem and its Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem (PTE), the Generalized PTE problem (GPTE), and the Fermat form of Generalized PTE problem (FPTE). The GPTE problem extends the PTE problem by allowing different sets of exponents, while the FPTE problem considers cases where the number of integers in the two sets differs by one. Multigrade chains are also investigated, involving multiple sets of integers satisfying the GPTE system. The study of PTE and GPTE problems is further extended from integers to trigonometric functions. Three novel generalizations of the Girard-Newton Identities are introduced to solve the PTE and GPTE problems: the first extends the domain of exponents to all integers; the second further generalizes to a broader form; and the third focuses on odd integer exponents. The constant $C$ in the PTE and GPTE problems is investigated, and a novel approach is proposed by introducing the normalized GPTE problem with six conjectures to determine bounds for each variable. This enhances the efficiency of computer searches for ideal non-negative integer solutions that satisfy $\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i^k = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} b_i^k$ for $k = k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n$. A general process of computer searches for GPTE solutions is discussed, and reference code for the search program is provided. Several parametric solutions for GPTE are presented, along with parametric methods for ideal prime solutions. Six open problems related to the PTE and GPTE problems are proposed, and three approaches to address these problems are suggested. In the appendix, an overview of the research status is provided for the 296 types of GPTE and FPTE that have ideal solutions.</description>

      <title>Equations defining Jacobians with Real Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $C:y^2=x(x-1)(x-a_1)(x-a_2)(x-a_3)$ is genus $2$ curve a natural question to ask is: Under what conditions on $a_1,a_2,a_3$ does the Jacobian $J(C)$ have real multiplication by $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{\Delta}]$ for some $\Delta&gt;0$. Over a hundred years ago Humbert gave an answer to this question for $\Delta=5$ and $\Delta=8$. In this paper we use work of Birkenhake and Wilhelm along with some classical results in enumerative geometry to generalize this to all discriminants, in principle. We also work it out explicitly in a few more cases.</description>

      <title>A geometric determinant method and geometric dimension growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a geometric version of the dimension growth conjecture. Let $X$ be an irreducible projective variety defined over $\mathbb{C}(t)$ of dimension $m$ and degree $d \geq 2$. The set $X(b)$ of $\mathbb{C}(t)$-rational points of degree smaller than $b$ lying on $X$, has a natural structure of an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$. We study the dimension and irreducibility of this variety for each $b$, and obtain a geometric analogue of the classical dimension growth conjecture in this case, namely that $\operatorname{dim} X(b) \leq mb $ for any $d \geq 2$. In particular, if $X$ is defined over $\mathbb{C}$, this provides uniform bounds on the dimension of the space of degree $b$ rational curves lying on $X$.
  By developing a geometric version of Heath-Brown's $p$-adic determinant method for varieties defined over $\mathbb{C}(t)$, we are furthermore able to study and bound the number of irreducible components of largest possible dimension of $X(b)$, providing an upper bound polynomial in $d$, and independent of $b$, for $d \geq 6$. This also allows us to study $C(b)$ when $C$ is a projective or affine curve, and obtain an analogue of the Bombieri--Pila theorem for affine curves (and similarly, a result for projective curves).</description>

      <title>On generalised Pythagorean triples over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised Pythagorean triples are integer tuples $(x,y,z)$ satisfying the equation $E_{a,b,c}: ax^2+by^2+cz^2=0$. A significant amount of research has been devoted towards understanding generalised Pythagorean triples and, in particular, we can now determine whether $E_{a,b,c}$ has solutions and find them in a computationally effective manner.
  In this paper, we consider an extension of generalised Pythagorean triples to number fields $K$. In particular, we survey and extend the existing results over $\mathbb{Q}$ for determining if $E_{a,b,c}$ has solutions over number fields and if so, to find and parameterise them, as well as to find a minimal solution. Throughout the text, we incorporate numerous examples to make our results accessible to all researchers interested in the topic of generalised Pythagorean triples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every natural number greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of a prime and a square-free number that is co-prime to any prime $q &gt; 3$. We also demonstrate that this result can be extended in a natural way, by assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis is true.</description>

      <title>The Moduli Stack of Breuil-Kisin Modules with Descent Data for Reductive Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the moduli stack $\mathcal{Y}$ of Breuil-Kisin modules with $\hat{G}$-structure and descent data, or Breuil-Kisin $(\Gamma,\hat{G})$-torsors for short. Specifically, for a dominant cocharacter $\mu$, we define the moduli stack $\mathcal{Y}^{\leq \mu}$ of Breuil-Kisin $(\Gamma,\hat{G})$-torsors with Hodge-Tate weights bounded by $\mu$. We prove that $\mathcal{Y}^{\leq \mu}$ is a $p$-adic formal algebraic stack, and show that it is smoothly equivalent to (the $p$-adic completion of) a twisted Schubert variety $\operatorname{Gr}^{\leq \mu}_{\mathcal{G}}$ in the sense of Pappas-Zhu. This is a reformatted and lightly edited version of the author's PhD thesis, submitted to Northwestern University in August 2024.</description>

      <title>On Differential and Boomerang Properties of a Class of Binomials over Finite Fields of Odd Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the differential and boomerang properties of a class of binomial $F_{r,u}(x) = x^r(1 + u\chi(x))$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $r = \frac{p^n+1}{4}$, $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, and $\chi(x) = x^{\frac{p^n -1}{2}}$ is the quadratic character in $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-PN with boomerang uniformity $0$ when $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. To the best of our knowledge, the second known non-PN function class with boomerang uniformity $0$, and the first such example over odd characteristic fields with $p &gt; 3$. Moreover, we show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$ when $p^n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. We also provide complete classifications of the differential and boomerang spectra of $F_{r,\pm1}$. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the differential uniformity of $F_{r,u}$ for $u\in \mathbb{F}_{p^n}^* \setminus \{\pm1\}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $A$ be a regular local ring on which $G$ acts. Under certain assumptions on $A$ and the action, Serre defined a function $a_G\colon G\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ which can be viewed as a higher dimensional analogue of Artin character, and conjectured that it is associated to a $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-rational representation of $G$ for any prime $\ell$ invertible in $A$. We prove this conjecture in the equal characteristic case.</description>

      <title>Multifractal analysis of maximal product of consecutive partial quotients in continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $[a_1(x), a_2(x), \ldots, a_n(x), \ldots]$ be the continued fraction expansion of an irrational number $x\in (0,1)$. We study the growth rate of the maximal product of consecutive partial quotients among the first $n$ terms, defined by $L_n(x)=\max_{1\leq i\leq n}\{a_i(x)a_{i+1}(x)\}$, from the viewpoint of multifractal analysis. More precisely, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the level set \[L(\varphi):=\left\{x\in (0,1):\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{L_n(x)}{\varphi(n)}=1\right\},\] where $\varphi:\mathbb{R^+}\to\mathbb{R^+}$ is an increasing function such that $\log \varphi$ is a regularly increasing function with index $\rho$. We show that there exists a jump of the Hausdorff dimension of $L(\varphi)$ when $\rho=1/2$. We also construct uncountably many discontinuous functions $\psi$ that cause the Hausdorff dimension of $L(\psi)$ to transition continuously from 1 to 1/2, filling the gap when $\rho=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Tensor structure on perverse Nori motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$ endowed with a complex embedding $\sigma: k \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$. In this paper we complete the construction of the six functor formalism on perverse Nori motives over quasi-projective $k$-varieties, initiated by Ivorra--Morel. Our main contribution is the construction of a closed monoidal structure on the derived categories of perverse Nori motives, compatibly with the analogous structure on the underlying constructible derived categories. This is based on an alternative presentation of perverse Nori motives, related to the conjectural motivic perverse $t$-structure on Voevodsky motivic sheaves. As a consequence, we obtain well-behaved Tannakian categories of motivic local systems over smooth, geometrically connected $k$-varieties. Exploiting the relation with Voevodsky motivic sheaves in its full strength, we are able to define Chern classes in the setting of perverse Nori motives, which leads to a motivic version of the relative Hard Lefschetz Theorem.</description>

      <title>Harmonic higher and extended weight enumerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the harmonic generalizations of well-known polynomials of codes over finite fields, namely the higher weight enumerators and the extended weight enumerators, and we derive the correspondences between these weight enumerators. Moreover, we present the harmonic generalization of Greene's Theorem for the higher (resp. extended) weight enumerators. As an application of this Greene's-type theorem, we provide the MacWilliams-type identity for harmonic higher weight enumerators of codes over finite fields. Finally, we use this new identity to give a new proof of the Assmus-Mattson Theorem for subcode supports of linear codes over finite fields using harmonic higher weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>A complete formalization of Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize a complete proof of the regular case of Fermat's Last Theorem in the Lean4 theorem prover. Our formalization includes a proof of Kummer's lemma, that is the main obstruction to Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes. Rather than following the modern proof of Kummer's lemma via class field theory, we prove it by using Hilbert's Theorems 90-94 in a way that is more amenable to formalization.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study eigenfunction localization for higher dimensional cat maps, a popular model of quantum chaos. These maps are given by linear symplectic maps in ${\mathrm{Sp}}(2g,\mathbb Z)$, which we take to be ergodic. Under some natural assumptions, we show that there is a density one sequence of integers $N$ so that as $N$ tends to infinity along this sequence, all eigenfunctions of the quantized map at the inverse Planck constant $N$ are uniformly distributed. For the two-dimensional case ($g=1$), this was proved by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). The higher dimensional case offers several new features and requires a completely different set of tools, including from additive combinatorics, in particular Bourgain's bound (2005) for Mordell sums, and a study of tensor product structures for the cat map.</description>

      <title>Duality for Arithmetic $p$-adic Pro-\'etale Cohomology of Analytic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We prove that the arithmetic $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of smooth partially proper spaces over $K$ satisfies a duality, as conjectured by Colmez, Gilles and Nizio{\l}. We derive it from the geometric duality on the Fargues-Fontaine curve by Galois descent techniques of Fontaine.</description>
