      <title>New Characterizations of First Order Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new characterizations of Sobolev spaces that are true under some mild conditions. We study modified first order Sobolev spaces on metric measure spaces: $\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space, $\hat{\mathrm{TC}}$-Newtonian space, and Gigli-like space. We prove that if the measure is Borel regular and $\sigma$-finite, then the modified $\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space is equivalent to the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space. Moreover, if additionally the measure is doubling then all modified spaces are equivalent to the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Spectral Eigen-subspace and Tree Structure for a Cantor Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the question of constructions of the possible Fourier bases $E(\Lambda)=\{e^{2\pi i \lambda x}:\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ for the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu_4)$, where $\mu_4$ is the standard middle-fourth Cantor measure and $\Lambda$ is a countable discrete set. We show that the set $$\mathop \bigcap_{p\in 2\Z+1}\left\{\Lambda\subset \R: \text{$E(\Lambda)$ and $E(p\Lambda)$ are Fourier bases for $L^2(\mu_4)$}\right\}$$ has the cardinality of the continuum. We also give other characterizations on the orthonormal set of exponential functions being a basis for the space $L^2(\mu_4)$ from the viewpoint of measure and dimension. Moreover, we provide a method of constructing explicit discrete set $\Lambda$ such that $E(\Lambda)$ and its all odd scaling sets $E(\Lambda),p\in2\Z+1,$ are still Fourier bases for $L^2(\mu_4)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove various estimates for the asymptotics of counting functions associated to point sets of coherent frames and Riesz sequences. The obtained results recover the necessary density conditions for coherent frames and Riesz sequences for general unimodular amenable groups, while providing more precise estimates under additional localization conditions on the coherent system for groups of polynomial growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize Birkhoff-James orthogonality of continuous vector-valued functions on a compact topological space. As an application of our investigation, Birkhoff-James orthogonality of real bilinear forms are studied. This allows us to present an elementary proof of the well-known Bhatia-\v{S}emrl Theorem in the real case.</description>

      <title>Concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems under Karamata regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Karamata regular operators, which is a notion of regularity that is suitable for obtaining concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems. This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes beyond, H\"olderian error bounds and H\"older regular operators. By concrete, we mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a function of the iteration number $k$ instead, of say, a function of the iterate $x^k$. While it is well-known that under H\"olderian-like assumptions many algorithms converge linearly/sublinearly (depending on the exponent), little it is known when the underlying problem data does not satisfy H\"olderian assumptions, which may happen if a problem involves exponentials and logarithms. Our main innovation is the usage of the theory of regularly varying functions which we showcase by obtaining concrete convergence rates for quasi-cylic algorithms in non-H\"olderian settings. This includes certain rates that are neither sublinear nor linear but sit somewhere in-between, including a case where the rate is expressed via the Lambert W function. Finally, we connect our discussion to o-minimal geometry and show that definable operators in any o-minimal structure are always Karamata regular.</description>

      <title>Extremal models and direct integrals in affine logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine logic is a fragment of continuous logic, introduced by Bagheri, in which only affine functions are allowed as connectives. This has the effect of endowing type spaces with the structure of compact convex sets. We study extremal models of affine theories (those that only realize extreme types), and the ways and conditions under which all models can be described from the extremal ones.
  We introduce and develop the general theory of measurable fields of metric structures and their direct integrals. One of our main results is an extremal decomposition theorem for models of simplicial theories, that is, affine theories whose type spaces form Choquet simplices. We prove that every model of a simplicial theory can be (uniquely) decomposed as a direct integral of extremal models. This generalizes known decomposition results (ergodic decomposition, tracial von Neumann factor decomposition), and moreover, holds without any separability hypothesis.
  Two extreme kinds of simplicial theories are Bauer theories, whose extreme types form a closed set, and Poulsen theories, whose extreme types form a dense set. We show that Keisler randomizations of continuous theories are, essentially, the same thing as affine Bauer theories. We establish a dichotomy result: a complete simplicial theory is either Bauer or Poulsen.
  As part of our analysis, we adapt many results and tools from continuous logic to the affine or extremal contexts (definability, saturation, type isolation, categoricity, etc.). We also provide a detailed study of the relations between continuous logic and affine logic.
  Finally, we present several examples of simplicial theories arising from theories in discrete logic, Hilbert spaces, probability measure-preserving systems, and tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Fourier transform of BV functions. We obtain an averaged Plancherel formula for BV functions and a characterisation of sets of finite perimeter in terms of their Fourier transform. We also sharpen a result of Herz concerning the "set derivative" of the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of a set. Finally, we obtain a new proof of the isoperimetric inequality and sharp bounds on the $L^2$-discrepancy of BV functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm within a Hilbert space framework that yields a projected solution for a quasi-variational inequality. This is achieved under the conditions that the operator associated with the problem is Lipschitz continuous and strongly monotone. The proposed algorithm is based on the interaction between the resolvent operator and the reflected resolvent operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of inner and outer balayage of positive Radon measures on a locally compact space $X$ to arbitrary $A\subset X$ with respect to suitable function kernels, developed in a series of the author's recent papers, we find conditions ensuring the validity of the integral representations. The results thereby obtained do hold and seem to be largely new even for several interesting kernels in classical and modern potential theory, which looks promising for possible applications.</description>

      <title>Entropy factorization via curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for establishing approximate factorization of entropy on arbitrary probability spaces, using a geometric notion known as non-negative sectional curvature. The resulting estimates are equivalent to entropy subadditivity and generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and provide a sharp modified log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs sampler of several particle systems in both continuous and discrete settings. The method allows us to obtain simple proofs of known results, as well as some new inequalities. We illustrate this through various applications, including discrete Gaussian free fields on arbitrary networks, the down-up walk on uniform $n$-sets, the uniform measure over permutations, and the uniform measure on the unit sphere in $\R^n$. Our method also yields a simple, coupling-based proof of the celebrated logarithmic Sobolev inequality for Langevin diffusions in a convex potential, which is one of the most emblematic applications of the Bakry-\'Emery criterion.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study the generalized Hilbert matrix operator $\Gamma_\mu$ acting on the Bergman spaces $A^p$ of the unit disc for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$. In particular, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the operator $\Gamma_\mu$ is bounded and we provide estimates of its operator norm. Finally, we also describe when $\Gamma_\mu$ is compact by computing its essential norm.</description>

Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a strong derivable map and calculate its derivative by employing a result in our previous work on strong derivability of maps arising by functional calculus of an unbounded scalar type spectral operator $R$ in a Banach space and the generalization to complete locally convex spaces of a classical result valid in the Banach space context. We apply this result to obtain a sequence of integrals converging to an integral of a complete locally convex space extension of a map arising by functional calculus of $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, numerous works have investigated several properties of symplectic eigenvalues. Remarkably, the results on symplectic eigenvalues have been found to be analogous to those of eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices with appropriate interpretations. In particular, symplectic analogs of famous eigenvalue inequalities are known today such as Weyl's inequalities, Lidskii's inequalities, and Schur--Horn majorization inequalities. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for equality in the symplectic analogs of the aforementioned inequalities. The equality conditions for the symplectic Weyl's and Lidskii's inequalities turn out to be analogous to the known equality conditions for eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use (versions of) the von Neumann inequality for Hilbert space contractions to prove several Schwarz-Pick inequalities. Specifically, we derive an alternate proof for a multi-point Schwarz-Pick inequality by Beardon and Minda, along with a generalized version for operators. Connections with model spaces and Peschl's invariant derivatives are established. Finally, Schwarz-Pick inequalities for analytic functions on polydisks and for higher order derivatives are discussed. An enhanced version of the Schwarz-Pick lemma, using the notion of distinguished variety, is obtained for the bidisk.</description>

Abstract: We construct a Banach space $X$ for which the set of norm-attaining functionals $NA(X,\mathbb{R})$ does not contain any non-trivial cone. Even more, given two linearly independent norm-attaining functionals on $X$, no other element of the segment between them attains its norm. Equivalently, the intersection of $NA(X,\mathbb{R})$ with the unit sphere of a two-dimensional subspace of $X^*$ contains, at most, four elements. In terms of proximinality, we show that for every closed subspace $Z$ of $X$ of codimension two, at most four element of the unit sphere of $X/Z$ has a representative of norm-one. We further relate this example with an open problem on norm-attaining operators.</description>

      <title>On the set of extreme points of the unit ball of a Hardy-Lorentz space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every measurable function $f:\,[0,a]\to\mathbb{C}$ such that $|f|=1$ a.e. on $[0,a]$ is an extreme point of the unit ball of the Lorentz space $\Lambda(\varphi)$ on $[0,a]$ whenever $\varphi$ is a not linear, strictly increasing, concave, continuous function on $[0,a]$ with $\varphi(0)=0$. As a consequence, we complement the classical de Leeuw-Rudin theorem on a description of extreme points of the unit ball of $H^1$ showing that $H^1$ is a unique Hardy-Lorentz space $H(\Lambda(\varphi))$, for which every extreme point of the unit ball is a normed outer function. Moreover, assuming that $\varphi$ is strictly increasing and strictly concave, we prove that every function $f\in H(\Lambda(\varphi))$, $\|f\|_{H(\Lambda(\varphi))}=1$, such that the absolute value of its nontangential limit ${f}(e^{it})$ is a constant on some set of positive measure of $[0,2\pi]$, is an extreme point of the unit ball of $H(\Lambda(\varphi))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.03019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we use the inverse function theorem for Banach spaces to interpolate a given real analytic spacelike curve $a$ in Lorentz-Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^3$ to another real analytic spacelike curve $c$, which is ``close" enough to $a$ in a certain sense by constructing a maximal surface containing them. Next we apply the same method to interpolate two given real analytic curve $a$ in Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$ and a real analytic curve $c$, which is also ``close" enough to ``a" in a certain sense with a minimal surface.
  Throughout this study, the Bj\"orling problem and Schwarz's solution to it play pivotal roles.</description>
