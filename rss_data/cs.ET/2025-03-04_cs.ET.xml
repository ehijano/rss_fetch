      <title>Single-Ferroelectric Memcapacitor-Based Time-Domain Content-Addressable Memory for Highly Precise Distance Function Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single ferroelectric memcapacitor-based time-domain (TD) content-addressable memory (CAM) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for high reliability and density. The proposed TD CAM features the symmetric capacitance-voltage characteristics of a ferroelectric memcapacitor with a gated p-i-n diode structure. This CAM performs search operations based on the variable capacitance of cells. The propagation delay of the TD CAM output signal is linearly correlated with the Hamming distance (HD) between input and output vectors. The proposed TD CAM array exhibits exceptional reliability in HD computation and in-memory search tasks owing to this linearity, considerably outperforming the conventional nonlinear voltage-domain CAM.</description>

      <title>Scalable Connectivity for Ising Machines: Dense to Sparse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, hardware implementations of Ising machines have emerged as a viable alternative to quantum computing for solving hard optimization problems among other applications. Unlike quantum hardware, dense connectivity can be achieved in classical systems. However, we show that dense connectivity leads to severe frequency slowdowns and interconnect congestion scaling unfavorably with system sizes. As a scalable solution, we propose a systematic sparsification method for dense graphs by introducing copy nodes to limit the number of neighbors per graph node. In addition to solving interconnect congestion, this approach enables constant frequency scaling where all spins in a network can be updated in constant time. On the other hand, sparsification introduces new difficulties, such as constraint-breaking between copied spins and increased convergence times to solve optimization problems, especially if exact ground states are sought. Relaxing the exact solution requirements, we find that the overheads in convergence times to be more mild. We demonstrate these ideas by designing probabilistic bit Ising machines using ASAP7 process design kits as well as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based implementations. Finally, we show how formulating problems in naturally sparse networks (e.g., by invertible logic) sidesteps challenges introduced by sparsification methods. Our results are applicable to a broad family of Ising machines using different hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Nanosatellite Constellation and Ground Station Co-design for Low-Latency Critical Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in nanosatellite technology lead to more Earth-observation satellites in low-Earth orbit. We explore using nanosatellite constellations to achieve low-latency detection for time-critical events, such as forest fires, oil spills, and floods. The detection latency comprises three parts: capture, compute and transmission. Previous solutions reduce transmission latency, but we find that the bottleneck is capture latency, accounting for more than 90% of end-to-end latency. We present a measurement study on how various satellite and ground station design factors affect latency. We offer design guidance to operators on how to choose satellite orbital configurations and design an algorithm to choose ground station locations. For six use cases, our design guidance reduces end-to-end latency by 5.6 to 8.2 times compared to the existing system.</description>

      <title>PI-HMR: Towards Robust In-bed Temporal Human Shape Reconstruction with Contact Pressure Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term in-bed monitoring benefits automatic and real-time health management within healthcare, and the advancement of human shape reconstruction technologies further enhances the representation and visualization of users' activity patterns. However, existing technologies are primarily based on visual cues, facing serious challenges in non-light-of-sight and privacy-sensitive in-bed scenes. Pressure-sensing bedsheets offer a promising solution for real-time motion reconstruction. Yet, limited exploration in model designs and data have hindered its further development. To tackle these issues, we propose a general framework that bridges gaps in data annotation and model design. Firstly, we introduce SMPLify-IB, an optimization method that overcomes the depth ambiguity issue in top-view scenarios through gravity constraints, enabling generating high-quality 3D human shape annotations for in-bed datasets. Then we present PI-HMR, a temporal-based human shape estimator to regress meshes from pressure sequences. By integrating multi-scale feature fusion with high-pressure distribution and spatial position priors, PI-HMR outperforms SOTA methods with 17.01mm Mean-Per-Joint-Error decrease.

Abstract: Biological invasions pose a significant threat to the sustainability of water sources. Efforts are increasingly being made to prevent invasions, eradicate established invaders, or control them. Remote sensing (RS) has long been recognized as a potential tool to aid in this effort, for example, by mapping the distribution of invasive species or identifying areas at risk of invasion. This paper provides a detailed explanation of a process for mapping the actual distribution of invasive species. This article presents a case studie on the detection of invasive Iris Pseudacorus L. using multispectral data captured by small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The process involved spectral feature mapping followed by semi-supervised classification, which produced accurate maps of these invasive.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimisation of Traveling Salesperson Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimisation challenge with widespread applications in logistics, operations research, and network design. While classical algorithms effectively solve small to medium-sized instances, they struggle with scalability due to exponential complexity. In this work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages IBM's Qiskit Runtime to integrate quantum optimisation techniques with classical machine learning methods, specifically K-Means clustering and Random Forest classifiers. These machine learning components aid in problem decomposition and noise mitigation, improving the quality of quantum solutions. Experimental results for TSP instances ranging from 4 to 8 cities reveal that the quantum-only approach produces solutions up to 21.7% worse than the classical baseline, while the hybrid method reduces this cost increase to 11.3% for 8 cities. This demonstrates that hybrid approaches improve solution quality compared to purely quantum methods but remain suboptimal compared to classical solvers. Despite current hardware limitations, these results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced methods for combinatorial optimisation, paving the way for future advancements in scalable quantum computing frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imminent commercialization of UAM requires stable, AI-based maintenance systems to ensure safety for both passengers and pedestrians. This paper presents a methodology for non-destructively detecting cracks in UAM propellers using drone propeller sound datasets. Normal operating sounds were recorded, and abnormal sounds (categorized as ripped and broken) were differentiated by varying the microphone-propeller angle and throttle power. Our novel approach integrates FFT and STFT preprocessing techniques to capture both global frequency patterns and local time-frequency variations, thereby enhancing anomaly detection performance. The constructed Acoustic Dataset for Crack of Drone Propeller (ADCP) demonstrates the potential for detecting propeller cracks and lays the groundwork for future UAM maintenance applications.</description>

      <title>MAPS: Multi-Fidelity AI-Augmented Photonic Simulation and Inverse Design Infrastructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design has emerged as a transformative approach for photonic device optimization, enabling the exploration of high-dimensional, non-intuitive design spaces to create ultra-compact devices and advance photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in computing and interconnects. However, practical challenges, such as suboptimal device performance, limited manufacturability, high sensitivity to variations, computational inefficiency, and lack of interpretability, have hindered its adoption in commercial hardware. Recent advancements in AI-assisted photonic simulation and design offer transformative potential, accelerating simulations and design generation by orders of magnitude over traditional numerical methods. Despite these breakthroughs, the lack of an open-source, standardized infrastructure and evaluation benchmark limits accessibility and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address this, we introduce MAPS, a multi-fidelity AI-augmented photonic simulation and inverse design infrastructure designed to bridge this gap. MAPS features three synergistic components: (1) MAPS-Data: A dataset acquisition framework for generating multi-fidelity, richly labeled devices, providing high-quality data for AI-for-optics research. (2) MAPS-Train: A flexible AI-for-photonics training framework offering a hierarchical data loading pipeline, customizable model construction, support for data- and physics-driven losses, and comprehensive evaluations. (3) MAPS-InvDes: An advanced adjoint inverse design toolkit that abstracts complex physics but exposes flexible optimization steps, integrates pre-trained AI models, and incorporates fabrication variation models. This infrastructure MAPS provides a unified, open-source platform for developing, benchmarking, and advancing AI-assisted photonic design workflows, accelerating innovation in photonic hardware optimization and scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Ray Tracing and Rayleigh Fading Models for Distributed MIMO Systems in Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed analysis of coverage in a factory environment using realistic 3D map data to evaluate the benefits of Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) over colocalized approach. Our study emphasizes the importance of network densification in enhancing D-MIMO performance, ensuring that User Equipment (UE) remains within range of multiple Access Points (APs). To assess MIMO capacity, we compare two propagation channel models: ray tracing and stochastic. While ray tracing provides accurate predictions by considering environmental details and consistent correlations within the MIMO response, stochastic models offer a more generalized and efficient approach. The analysis outlines the strengths and limitations of each model when applied to the simulation of the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) single-user capacity in various D-MIMO deployment scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new method for calculating expectation values of operators that can be expressed as a linear combination of unitary (LCU) operators. This method allows to perform this calculation in a single quantum circuit measuring a single qubit, which speeds up the computation process. This method is general for any quantum algorithm and is of particular interest in the acceleration of variational quantum algorithms, both in real devices and in simulations. We analyze its application to the parameter optimization process of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the case of having degenerate values in the matrix of the Ising problem. Finally, we apply it to several Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems to analyze the speedup of the method in circuit simulators.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Clifford Assisted Optimal Pass Selection for Quantum Transpilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of quantum programs in the NISQ era is limited by high levels of device noise. To increase the fidelity of quantum programs running on NISQ devices, a variety of optimizations have been proposed. These include mapping passes, routing passes, scheduling methods and standalone optimisations which are usually incorporated into a transpiler as passes. Popular transpilers such as those proposed by Qiskit, Cirq and Cambridge Quantum Computing make use of these extensively. However, choosing the right set of transpiler passes and the right configuration for each pass is a challenging problem. Transpilers often make critical decisions using heuristics since the ideal choices are impossible to identify without knowing the target application outcome. Further, the transpiler also makes simplifying assumptions about device noise that often do not hold in the real world. As a result, we often see effects where the fidelity of a target application decreases despite using state-of-the-art optimisations. To overcome this challenge, we propose OPTRAN, a framework for Choosing an Optimal Pass Set for Quantum Transpilation. OPTRAN uses classically simulable quantum circuits composed entirely of Clifford gates, that resemble the target application, to estimate how different passes interact with each other in the context of the target application. OPTRAN then uses this information to choose the optimal combination of passes that maximizes the target application's fidelity when run on the actual device. Our experiments on IBM machines show that OPTRAN improves fidelity by 87.66% of the maximum possible limit over the baseline used by IBM Qiskit. We also propose low-cost variants of OPTRAN, called OPTRAN-E-3 and OPTRAN-E-1 that improve fidelity by 78.33% and 76.66% of the maximum permissible limit over the baseline at a 58.33% and 69.44% reduction in cost compared to OPTRAN respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Decentraland Economy: Multifaceted Parcel Attributes, Key Insights, and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive Decentraland parcels dataset, called IITP-VDLand, sourced from diverse platforms such as Decentraland, OpenSea, Etherscan, Google BigQuery, and various Social Media Platforms. Unlike existing datasets which have limited attributes and records, IITP-VDLand offers a rich array of attributes, encompassing parcel characteristics, trading history, past activities, transactions, and social media interactions. Alongside, we introduce a key attribute in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which measures the uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world. Addressing the significant challenge posed by the dispersed nature of this data across various sources, we employ a systematic approach, utilizing both available APIs and custom scripts, to gather it. Subsequently, we meticulously curate and organize the information into four distinct fragments: (1) Characteristics, (2) OpenSea Trading History, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions, and (4) Social Media. We envisage that this dataset would serve as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. The performance benchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our dataset yields promising results, achieving a maximum R2 score of 0.8251 and an accuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier. The key findings reveal that the ensemble models perform better than both deep learning and linear models for our dataset. We observe a significant impact of coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic indicators on the prediction of parcel prices.</description>

      <title>EvGNN: An Event-driven Graph Neural Network Accelerator for Edge Vision</title>

Abstract: Edge vision systems combining sensing and embedded processing promise low-latency, decentralized, and energy-efficient solutions that forgo reliance on the cloud. As opposed to conventional frame-based vision sensors, event-based cameras deliver a microsecond-scale temporal resolution with sparse information encoding, thereby outlining new opportunities for edge vision systems. However, mainstream algorithms for frame-based vision, which mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can hardly exploit the advantages of event-based vision as they are typically optimized for dense matrix-vector multiplications. While event-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sparse event-based vision, their irregular structure is a challenge that currently hinders the design of efficient hardware accelerators. In this paper, we propose EvGNN, the first event-driven GNN accelerator for low-footprint, ultra-low-latency, and high-accuracy edge vision with event-based cameras. It relies on three central ideas: (i) directed dynamic graphs exploiting single-hop nodes with edge-free storage, (ii) event queues for the efficient identification of local neighbors within a spatiotemporally decoupled search range, and (iii) a novel layer-parallel processing scheme allowing for a low-latency execution of multi-layer GNNs. We deployed EvGNN on a Xilinx KV260 Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform and benchmarked it on the N-CARS dataset for car recognition, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 87.8% and an average latency per event of 16$\mu$s, thereby enabling real-time, microsecond-resolution event-based vision at the edge.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for dynamic resource allocation in wireless communication systems. An environment that includes a base station, multiple antennas, and user equipment is created. Using the RLlib library, various DRL algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are then applied. These algorithms are compared based on their ability to optimize resource allocation, focusing on the impact of different learning rates and scheduling policies. The findings demonstrate that the choice of algorithm and learning rate significantly influences system performance, with DRL providing more efficient resource allocation compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Fault Tolerance and Scalability in Distributed File Systems: A Case Study of GFS, HDFS, and MinIO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed File Systems (DFS) are essential for managing vast datasets across multiple servers, offering benefits in scalability, fault tolerance, and data accessibility. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three prominent DFSs - Google File System (GFS), Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and MinIO - focusing on their fault tolerance mechanisms and scalability under varying data loads and client demands. Through detailed analysis, how these systems handle data redundancy, server failures, and client access protocols, ensuring reliability in dynamic, large-scale environments is assessed. In addition, the impact of system design on performance, particularly in distributed cloud and computing architectures is assessed. By comparing the strengths and limitations of each DFS, the paper provides practical insights for selecting the most appropriate system for different enterprise needs, from high availability storage to big data analytics.</description>
