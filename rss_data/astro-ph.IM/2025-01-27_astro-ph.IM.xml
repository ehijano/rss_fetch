      <title>Learning to See: Applying Inverse Recurrent Inference Machines to See through Refractive Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14055v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A$^*$). Scattering in the turbulent plasma of the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of Sgr A$^*$ on scales only marginally smaller than the fiducial resolution of EHT. Therefore, this process both diffractive blurs and adds stochastic refractive substructures that limits the practical angular resolution of EHT images of Sgr A$^*$. We utilized a novel recurrent neural network machine learning framework to demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate interstellar scattering at wavelengths of $1.3\,{\rm mm}$ near the galactic center up to structures at the scale of $5\mu{as}$ well below the nominal instrumental resolution of EHT, $24\,\mu{\rm as}$.</description>

      <title>Alignment and optical verification of DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed, characterised, and verified an alignment method for the DESHIMA 2.0 instrument, an ultra wide-band spectrometer operating between 200-400 GHz, at the ASTE telescope. Due to the ultra-wide bandwidth of DESHIMA 2.0, we require the alignment to work across the entire spectral range. Moreover, alignment should be possible remotely, as on-site access is impractical. To fulfill these requirements we mounted the warm optics, consisting of a modified Dragonian dual reflector system, on a motor controlled hexapod. Crucial in the alignment procedure is our sky chopper, which allows fast beam switching. Importantly, it has a small entrance and exit aperture coupling to (cold) sky, which creates a measurable signal with respect to the warm cabin environment. By scanning the instrument beam across the entrance aperture of the sky chopper using the hexapod, we found the hexapod configuration that produced the lowest signal on our detectors, implying the beam is coupled fully to cold sky and not the warm cabin. We first characterised the alignment procedure in the laboratory, where we used a vat containing liquid nitrogen as the cold source behind the sky chopper. Then, we applied the alignment procedure to DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE, using the sky as the cold source. We used observations of Mars to calculate the aperture efficiency. We did not recover the aperture efficiencies up to design values, which we suspect to be due to a raised sidelobe level or error beam pattern. However, we did find that the alignment procedure significantly improved the aperture efficiency compared to previously reported values of the aperture efficiency of DESHIMA at ASTE, which indicates the veracity of the alignment procedure.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limits of Habitability: A Catalog of Rocky Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several ground- and space-based searches have increased the number of known exoplanets to nearly 6000. While most are highly unlike our planet, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide the most intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As the detections increase, it is critical to probe the HZ as well as its limits empirically using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to probe the limits of surface habitability. We analyze all known exoplanets and identify 67 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 38 in a narrower 3D-model HZ. We compare their demographics with the full catalog of exoplanets, analyze their characteristics, give HZ limits for each system, and prioritize targets for observation. We address another critical dimension to this exploration and compile missing stellar age estimates for these candidates.
  To probe the limits of habitability, we identify several transiting and non-transiting rocky planets that can provide constraints on the inner and outer edge of the HZ, explore how eccentricity influences habitability, and identify the oldest HZ worlds as well as exoplanets with similar flux to modern Earth's. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize their search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the Extremely Large Telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, and LIFE -- and to design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these intriguing worlds, addressing the question of the limits of surface habitability on exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background with the space-borne gravitational-wave detector network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is one of the main detection targets for future millihertz space-borne gravitational-wave observatories such as the \ac{LISA}, TianQin, and Taiji. For a single LISA-like detector, a null-channel method was developed to identify the SGWB by integrating data from the A and E channels with a noise-only T channel. However, the noise monitoring channel will not be available if one of the laser interferometer arms fails. By combining these detectors, it will be possible to build detector networks to search for SGWB via cross-correlation analysis.In this work, we developed a Bayesian data analysis method based on \ac{TDI} Michelson-type channel. We then investigate the detectability of the TianQin-LISA detector network for various isotropic SGWB. Assuming a three-month observation, the TianQin-LISA detector network could be able to confidently detect SGWB with energy density as low as $\Omega_{\rm PL} = 6.0 \times 10^{-13}$, $\Omega_{\rm Flat} = 2.0 \times 10^{-12}$ and $\Omega_{\rm SP} = 1.2 \times 10^{-12}$ for power-law, flat and single-peak models, respectively.</description>

      <title>The NCORES Program: Precise planetary masses, null results, and insight into the planet mass distribution near the radius gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NCORES was a large observing program on the ESO HARPS spectrograph, dedicated to measuring the masses of Neptune-like and smaller transiting planets discovered by the TESS satellite using the radial velocity technique. This paper presents an overview of the programme, its scientific goals and published results, covering 35 planets in 18 planetary systems. We present spectrally derived stellar characterisation and mass constraints for five additional TOIs where radial velocity observations found only marginally significant signals (TOI-510.01, $M_p=1.08^{+0.58}_{-0.55}M_\oplus$), or found no signal (TOIs 271.01, 641.01, 697.01 and 745.01). A newly detected non-transiting radial velocity candidate is presented orbiting TOI-510 on a 10.0d orbit, with a minimum mass of $4.82^{+1.29}_{-1.26}M_\oplus$, although uncertainties on the system architecture and true orbital period remain. Combining the NCORES sample with archival known planets we investigate the distribution of planet masses and compositions around and below the radius gap, finding that the population of planets below the gap is consistent with a rocky composition and ranges up to a sharp cut-off at $10M_\oplus$. We compare the observed distribution to models of pebble- and planetesimal-driven formation and evolution, finding good broad agreement with both models while highlighting interesting areas of potential discrepancy. Increased numbers of precisely measured planet masses in this parameter space are required to distinguish between pebble and planetesimal accretion.</description>

      <title>Extracting the X-ray reverberation response functions from the AGN light curves using an autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a machine-learning algorithm widely used for signal processing and feature reconstruction. While the X-ray reverberation signatures that contain the information of the accretion disk and the X-ray emitting corona are commonly analyzed in the Fourier domain, this work aims to extract the reverberation response functions directly from the AGN light curves. The VAE is trained using the simulated light curves that contain the primary X-rays from the lamp-post corona varying its height and the corresponding reflection X-rays from the disk. We use progressively more realistic light-curve models, such as those that include the effects of disk-propagating fluctuations and random noises, to assess the ability of the VAE to reconstruct the response profiles. Interestingly, the VAE can recognize the reverberation patterns on the light curves, hence the coronal height can be predicted. We then deploy the VAE model to the XMM-Newton data of IRAS 13224-3809 and directly estimate, for the first time, the response functions of this source in various observations. The result reveals the corona changing its height between $3~r_{\rm g}$ and $20~r_{\rm g}$, which is correlated with the source luminosity and in line with previous literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this method.</description>

      <title>ngVLA Synthetic Observations of Ionized Gas in Massive Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive star formation involves significant ionization in the innermost regions near the central object, such as gravitationally trapped H II regions, jets, ionized disks, or winds. Resolved observations of the associated continuum and recombination line emission are crucial for guiding theory. The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will enable unprecedented observations of thermal emission with 1 mas resolution, providing a new perspective on massive star formation at scales down to a few astronomical units at kiloparsec distances. This work presents synthetic interferometric ngVLA observations of the free-free continuum (93-GHz band), $\mathrm{H41\alpha}$, and $\mathrm{H38\alpha}$ recombination lines from ionized jets and disks around massive protostars. Using the sf3dmodels Python package, we generate gas distributions based on analytical models, which are then processed through the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. Our results indicate that the ngVLA can easily resolve, both spatially and spectrally, the ionized jet from a 15 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ protostar at 700 pc, distinguishing between collimated jets and wide-angle winds, and resolving their launching radii, widths, and any substructure down to a few astronomical units. Detailed studies of radio jets launched by massive protostars will be feasible up to distances of $\sim 2$ kpc. Furthermore, ngVLA will be able to study in detail the ionized disks around massive ($&gt; 10~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) protostars up to distances from 4 to 12 kpc, resolving their kinematics and enabling the measurement of their central masses across the Galaxy. These observations can be conducted with on-source integrations of only a few hours.</description>

      <title>Best of both worlds: Fusing hyperspectral data from two generations of spectro-imagers for X-ray astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the launch of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) and the advent of microcalorimeter detectors, X-ray astrophysics is entering in a new era of spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy. But while this new generation of X-ray telescopes have much finer spectral resolutions than their predecessors (e.g. XMM-Newton, Chandra), they also have coarser spatial resolutions, leading to problematic cross-pixel contamination. This issue is currently a critical limitation for the study of extended sources such as galaxy clusters or supernova remnants. To increase the scientific output of XRISM's hyperspectral data, we propose to fuse it with XMM-Newton data, and seek to obtain a cube with the best spatial and spectral resolution of both generations. This is the aim of hyperspectral fusion. In this article, we have implemented an algorithm that jointly deconvolves the spatial response of XRISM and the spectral response of XMM-Newton. To do so, we construct a forward model adapted for instrumental systematic degradations and Poisson noise, then tackle hyperspectral fusion as a regularized inverse problem. We test three methods of regularization: low rank approximation with Sobolev regularization; low rank approximation with 2D wavelet sparsity ; and 2D-1D wavelet sparsity. We test our method on toy models constructed from hydrodynamic simulations of supernova remnants. We find that our method reconstructs the ground truth well even when the toy model is complex. For the regularization term, we find that while the low rank approximation worked well as a spectral denoiser in models with less spectral variability, it introduced a bias in models with more spectral variability, in which case the 2D-1D wavelet sparsity regularization worked best. After demonstrating a proof of concept in this article, we aim to apply this method to real X-ray astrophysical data in the near future.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Problem of Distributional Shifts: Correcting Misspecified, High-Dimensional Data-Driven Priors for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications, it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g. a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations, and we showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that, starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.</description>

      <title>Cross-Survey Image Transformation: Enhancing SDSS and DECaLS Images to Near-HSC Quality for Advanced Astronomical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on transforming galaxy images between astronomical surveys, specifically enhancing images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) to achieve quality comparable to the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC). We proposed a hybrid model called Pix2WGAN, which integrates the pix2pix framework with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to convert low-quality observational images into high-quality counterparts. Our model successfully transformed DECaLS images into pseudo-HSC images, yielding impressive results and significantly enhancing the identification of complex structures, such as galaxy spiral arms and tidal tails, which may have been overlooked in the original DECaLS images. Moreover, Pix2WGAN effectively addresses issues like artifacts, noise, and blurriness in both source and target images. In addition to the basic Pix2WGAN model, we further developed an advanced architecture called Cascaded Pix2WGAN, which incorporates a multi-stage training mechanism designed to bridge the quality gap between SDSS and HSC images, demonstrating similarly promising outcomes. We systematically assessed the similarity between the model-generated pseudo-HSC images and actual HSC images using various metrics, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), along with perceptual metrics such as Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). The results indicate that images transformed by our model outperform both the original SDSS and DECaLS images across nearly all evaluation metrics. Our research is expected to provide significant technical support for astronomical data analysis, cross-survey image integration, and high-precision astrometry.</description>

      <title>Templated Anisotropic Analyses of the LISA Galactic Foreground</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will feature a prominent anisotropic astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave signal, arising from the tens of millions of unresolved mHz white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way: the Galactic foreground. While proper characterization of the Galactic foreground as a noise source will be crucial for every LISA science goal, it is extremely scientifically interesting in its own right, comprising -- along with $\sim10^4$ resolvable white dwarf binaries -- a complete sample of every mHz white dwarf binary in our Galaxy. We present a novel Bayesian analysis of the LISA Galactic foreground that directly treats its anisotropy via astrophysically-motivated templates, allowing for a direct connection between the observed time-modulation of the foreground amplitude and the underlying spatial distribution of the Milky Way. We validate the efficacy of this approach via simulated data and show that it is able to accurately recover the foreground spectrum in the presence of LISA instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids on-board inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10\,$AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30\,$AU and $\sim 10\,$Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with $20\,$cm mirrors or $5\,$m radio dishes, although for the laser case this would require lower laser frequency noise relative to the LISA lasers. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>

      <title>Multiband Embeddings of Light Curves</title>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that considers the multiband and non-uniform cadence without having to compute complex features. Our proposed model consists of an ensemble of RNNs, which do not require the entire light curve to perform inference, making the inference process simpler. The ensemble is able to adapt to varying numbers of bands, tested on three real light curve datasets, namely Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, and ZTF, to demonstrate its potential for generalization. We also show the capabilities of deep learning to perform not only classification, but also regression of physical parameters such as effective temperature and radius. Our ensemble model demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with fewer observations, thus providing potential for early classification of sources from facilities such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST. The results underline the model's effectiveness and flexibility, making it a promising tool for future astronomical surveys. Our research has shown that a multitask learning approach can enrich the embeddings obtained by the models, making them instrumental to solve additional tasks, such as determining the orbital parameters of binary systems or estimating parameters for object types beyond periodic ones.</description>

      <title>Electric field reconstruction with three polarizations for the radio detection of ultra-high energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum and energy fluence carried by the electric field at a given measurement position are the key parameters for retrieving information from radio signals generated by extensive air showers. Accurate reconstruction of the electric field from the signals recorded by the antennas is therefore essential for the radio detection technique. Conventional reconstruction methods primarily focus on electric field reconstruction for antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this paper, we introduce an analytical least-squares ($\chi^2$) reconstruction method that operates with both two and three polarizations, providing the reconstructed electric field at each antenna. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves an accuracy better than 4\% in determining the Hilbert peak amplitude of the electric field and better than 6\% accuracy on the estimation of the energy fluence, with minimal bias. Additionally, this was found to be reliable for almost any arrival directions, and the direction dependence has been investigated. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric field estimation for inclined air showers. Consequently, the method enhances our ability to extract information about cosmic rays from the detected signals in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>COOL Research DAO Whitepaper -- Towards community-owned astrophysics for everyone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.    Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.    Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.     Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise  or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>
