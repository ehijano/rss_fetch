      <title>Continuum Reverberation in Active Galactic Nuclei Disks Only With Sufficient X-ray Luminosity and Low Albedo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disk continuum reverberation mapping is one of the primary ways we learn about active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Reverberation mapping assumes that time-varying X-rays incident on the accretion disk drive variability in UV-optical light curves emitted by AGN disks, and uses lags between X-ray and UV-optical variability on the light-crossing timescale to measure the radial temperature profile and extent of AGN disks. However, recent reverberation mapping campaigns have revealed oddities in some sources such as weakly correlated X-ray and UV light curves, longer than anticipated lags, and evidence of intrinsic variability from disk fluctuations. To understand how X-ray reverberation works with realistic accretion disk structures, we perform 3D multi-frequency radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of X-ray reprocessing by the UV-emitting region of an AGN disk using sophisticated opacity models that include line opacities for both the X-ray and UV radiation. We find there are two important factors that determine whether X-ray irradiation and UV emission will be well-correlated, the ratio of X-ray to UV luminosity and significant absorption. When these factors are met, the reprocessing of X-rays into UV is nearly instantaneous, as is often assumed, although linear reprocessing models are insufficient to fully capture X-ray reprocessing in our simulations. Nevertheless, we can still easily recover mock lags in our light curves using software that assumes linear reprocessing. Finally, the X-rays in our simulation heat the disk, increasing temperatures by a factor of 2--5 in the optically thin region, which could help explain the discrepancy between measured and anticipated lags.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, I discuss the macroscopic properties of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, whose inferred mass and radius read $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km. By using the neutralino as WIMP dark matter with a fixed Fermi momentum, I calculated the maximum possible mass of this object, the moment of inertia, the gravitational redshift, the dimensionless tidal parameter, and the total amount of dark matter for a 1.2$M_\odot$ star.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Equations of State for Neutron Stars with First-Order Phase Transitions: A Qualitative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state is fundamental in describing matter under the extreme conditions characteristic of neutron stars and is central to advancing our understanding of dense matter physics. A critical challenge, however, lies in accurately modelling first-order phase transitions while ensuring thermodynamic consistency and aligning with astrophysical observations. This study explores two frameworks for constructing EoSs with first-order phase transitions: the polytropic interpolation method and the randomized speed-of-sound interpolation approach. It is found that the mass-radius relation and pressure vs. energy density relation are blind towards the thermodynamic consistency check. The polytropic interpolation method can exhibit discontinuities in the chemical potential for first-order phase transition, raising concerns regarding potential causality violations and thermodynamic inconsistencies. In contrast, the speed of sound interpolation approach ensures continuity in the chemical potential, offering a more thermodynamically consistent and reliable framework. Moreover, the sound speed method effectively captures the softer segment of the mass-radius spectrum, a capability not achieved by the consistent piecewise-polytropic approach due to its monotonic stiffness constraints. The speed of sound definition involving number density and chemical potential reveals the thermodynamic inconsistency, making it a more consistent and robust definition. These findings underscore the importance of thermodynamic consistency in EoS construction and highlight the advantages of the randomized speed-of-sound method for modelling phase transitions in dense matter.</description>

      <title>Determining the nature of IC 10 X-2: A comprehensive study of the Optical/Infrared emission from an extragalactic BeHMXB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the optical and infrared (IR) properties of high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IC 10 X-2, classified as a super-giant HMXB and super-fast X-ray transient (SFXT) by previous work. Our analysis of regular (daily and weekly) observations by both the Zwicky Transient Factory and Las Cumbres Observatory over a ~5 year period indicates both periodic flares and variations in the apparent magnitude and color with a $\sim26.5$~d period -- likely the orbital period of this binary system. The periodic flaring suggests the stellar companion is a Be star, with flares resulting from increased accretion onto the neutron star when it enters the stellar decretion disk. The periodic variations in the optical/IR brightness and color likely result from orbital variations in the Hydrogen column density along the line of sight or a transient accretion disk around the neutron star. Lastly, the numerous, short duration, episodes where IC 10 X-2 is significantly ``redder'' or ``bluer'' than normal likely result from from clumps within this system -- which can accrete onto the neutron star (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear bluer), or pass through the line of sight (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear redder). These results substantially increase our understanding of the evolution of this source, a significant source of ionizing photons in its host galaxy IC 10, a low mass, metal-poor starburst galaxy similar in many respect to those thought to be common in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Origin likelihood functions for extreme-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike neutrinos and photons arriving from extra-galactic sources, ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) do not trace back to their origins due to propagation effects such as magnetic deflections and energy losses. For ankle energies, UHECRs can propagate for hundreds of megaparsecs with negligible energy losses but the directional information is lost after a few megaparsecs. On the other hand, at the highest energies the directions are kept for larger distances due to the increased rigidity but the interaction rates with the cosmic microwave background strongly suppress the cosmic rays within a few to tens of megaparsecs. Therefore, UHECRs with energies $E &gt; 10^{20}$ eV (extreme-energy cosmic rays (ExECRs)) such as the Amaterasu event recently reported by Telescope Array, are of particular interest to identify the sources within our galactic neighborhood. However, photonuclear interactions are stochastic in nature and produce changes in the nuclear species emitted, which makes it difficult the task of estimating the likelihood distribution of its origin. This work discusses a novel procedure to estimate the likelihood of the origin for extreme-energy cosmic rays based on probability distributions for UHECR stochastic interactions. The method is applied to the Amaterasu event and compared to recently published works which employ Monte Carlo codes (e.g. CRPropa) in their analysis. The advantages of the method presented here are demonstrated by the increased resolution and the ease of computation unlike other approaches employed so far. The results presented indicate that the localization of the origin of extreme energy cosmic rays could be possible in some cases without knowledge of the original composition.</description>

      <title>Structure and Skewness of the Effective Inspiral Spin Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well-measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$ -- a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary's orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least $12 \% - 17\%$ (at $90\%$ credibility). Our models do not find an excess of non-spinning systems and instead find that at least $\sim 20 \%$ of the binaries have some degree of negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$. The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of the Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the observational images of a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole, wherein a thin accretion disk, serving as the sole background light source, is situated on the equatorial plane of the black hole. The inner boundary of the thin accretion disk extends to the event horizon, and the accretion material in the disk exhibits two different motion behaviors, that is, it moves along the critical plunging orbit inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and follows the Keplerian orbit outside the ISCO. The shadow image is captured on the imaging plane of a zero angular momentum observer utilizing advanced fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques. The results demonstrate that an image consistently reveals a dark region encircled by a narrow photon ring, which is called the inner shadow. At low observation inclination angles, the observation intensity is highly concentrated, with the lensed image of accretion disk being superimposed on the direct image. As observation inclination angle increases, the direct and lensed images gradually separate, becoming distinctly distinguishable and forming a hat-like structure. Furthermore, variations in the parameter space and observation angle will influence pertinent image characteristics, including image symmetry, the range or deformation degree of the inner shadow. We further examined the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Subsequently, we also examined the redshift distribution on the disk. The findings indicate that while variations in relevant parameters do influence the redshift distribution, the primary factor is the change in observational inclination. The observer can detect both redshift and blueshift phenomena on the screen when viewed at a higher observation angle.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Heating in 1D, 2D, and 3D core-collapse supernovae: characterizing the explosion of high-compactness stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion (leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed explosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the pre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding the outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the collapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a straightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion properties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies have been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict different explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which is related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in determining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of the explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield failed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the shock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax simulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead, due to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness, high-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show that 1D+ simulations that include $\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length theory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models, which we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable accuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Stellar Population and Metal Production in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As gravitational wave detections increase the number of observed compact binaries (consisting of neutron stars or blacks), we begin to probe the different conditions producing these binaries. Most studies of compact remnant formation focus either on stellar collapse from the evolution of field binary stars in gas-free environments or the formation of stars in clusters where dynamical interactions capture the compact objects, forming binaries. But a third scenario exists. In this paper, we study the fate of massive stars formed, accrete gas, and evolve in the dense disks surrounding supermassive black holes. We calculate the explosions produced and compact objects formed by the collapse of these massive stars. Nucleosynthetic yields may provide an ideal, directly observable, diagnostic of the formation and fate of these stars in active galactic nuclei. We present a first study of the explosive yields from these stars, comparing these yields with the observed nucleosynthetic signatures in the disks around supermassive stars with quasars. We show that, even though these stars tend to form black holes, their rapid rotation leads to disks that can eject a considerable amount of iron during the collapse of the star. The nucleosynthetic yields from these stars can produce constraints on the number of systems formed in this manner, but further work is needed to exploit variations from the initial models presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>The timing and spectral properties of the 2022 outburst of SGR J1935+2154 observed with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered a new active episode on October 10, 2022, with X-ray bursts and enhanced persistent emission. At the tail of high burst rate interval, lasting several hours, radio bursts were detected, revealing the connection between the X-ray activities and radio emissions. We analyzed observations of SGR J1935+2154 for nearly three months, using data from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We report the timing and spectral results following the onset of this outburst. In general, the X-ray flux of the persistent emission decays exponentially. While a flare is evident on the light curve, a fast radio burst (FRB) was detected immediately following the peak of this flare. We found a phase jump of pulse profile, with a deviation of $0.16\pm0.03$ phase, which is related to the glitch. The spectra are well fit with the combination of a blackbody and a power law model. The decay of the outburst is dominated by the drop of the non-thermal component, which also leads to the increase of thermal proportion. The photon index of the power law is inversely correlated with both the unabsorbed flux and the burst rate. We find that unlike the large variety of the persistent emission around FRB 221014, the X-ray properties are very stable when FRBs 221021 and 221201 happened. These results manifest the connection between glitch, phase jump, X-ray burst, and radio burst, crucial for studying the mutation in twisted magnetic fields and constraining the trigger mechanism of radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark matter distribution on neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and observable impacts of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars using a combined equation of state that integrates the relativistic mean field (RMF) model for baryonic matter with a variable density profile for DM, incorporating DM-baryon interactions mediated by the Higgs field. Employing three RMF parameter sets (NL3, BigApple, and IOPB-I) for baryonic matter, we analyze mass-radius relations, maximum mass, and tidal deformability, focusing on DM density scaling ($\alpha$) and steepness ($\beta$) parameters. Our findings reveal that increased DM concentration significantly enhances NS compactness, shifting mass-radius profiles and reducing tidal deformability. The DM influence strongly depends on the steepness of the DM density profile, where high $\beta$ values lead to strongly confined DM within the NS core, resulting in more compact and less deformable configurations. Observational constraints from PSR J0740+6620 and GW170817 impose consistent structural limits on DM fractions across different equations of state models, narrowing the allowable parameter space for DM and linking specific combinations of $\alpha M_{\chi}$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and $\beta$ values to viable NS structures. This study highlights the interplay among DM concentration, nuclear stiffness, and observational data in shaping NS structure, offering insights into future constraints on DM in high-density astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-dominated relativistic viscous accretion flows around rotating black holes with shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic, viscous, advective, neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) around rotating stellar mass black holes, incorporating neutrino cooling. By adopting an effective potential to describe the spacetime geometry around the rotating black holes, we self-consistently solve the governing NDAF equations to obtain global transonic accretion solutions. Our findings indicate that, depending on the model parameters, namely energy ($\varepsilon$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), accretion rate ($\dot{m}$), viscosity ($\alpha$) and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$), NDAFs may harbor standing shocks where the Rankine-Hugoniot shock conditions (RHCs) are satisfied. Utilizing these shock-induced NDAF solutions, we compute the neutrino luminosity ($L_{\nu}$) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ($L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$) across a wide range of model parameters. We further calculate maximum neutrino luminosity ($L_{\nu}^{\rm max}$) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ($L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}^{\rm max}$) resulting in $L_{\nu}^{\rm max} \sim 10^{51-53}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($10^{48-51}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and $L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}^{\rm max} \sim 10^{48-52}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($10^{42-49}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for $a_{\rm k}=0.99$ (0.0). These findings suggest that shocked NDAF solutions are potentially promising to explain the energy output of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We employ our NDAF model formalism to elucidate $L^{\rm obs}_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$ for five GRBs with known redshifts and estimate their accretion rate (${\dot m}$) based on the spin ($a_{\rm k}$) of the central source of GRBs under consideration.</description>

Abstract: Supernova 2018ibb of the PISN category related to the dynamical instability of oxygen core in a supermassive star induced by pair-creation shows at the nebular stage strong [\oiii] emission lines of an uncertain origin. I propose a simple model that demonstrates a possibility of [O III] lines emission from the supernova oxygen matter ionized and heated by the $^{56}$Co radioactive decay. The reason is pinpointed by which the [O III] line luminosity among supernovae of PISN category can vary in a broad range.</description>

      <title>Effects of inner crusts on $g$-mode oscillations in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the influence of neutron stars' crusts on the non-radial $g$-mode oscillations and examine their correlations with nuclear matter properties fixed by adopting 10 different relativistic density functionals. At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\gtrsim 1.4\ M_{\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles.</description>

      <title>Markarian 590: The AGN Awakens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) Mkn 590 recently underwent a sudden \lq re-ignition\rq, marked by substantial increases in optical/UV and X-ray continuum flux since last year. \textit{Swift}-XRT observations revealed the re-emergence of a soft X-ray excess (SXE) as the source transitioned from a low-flux state in July 2023 to a significantly higher flux state in October 2024. This evolution was in response to an order-of-magnitude increase in extreme-UV (EUV) continuum emission, detected by \textit{Swift}-UVOT. Follow-up optical spectra from the Las Cumbres Observatory confirmed the presence of dynamically broadened Balmer lines, He II emission, and the emergence of the Fe II complex. As the Eddington fraction increased by 10\% over the last 15 months, we found clear evidence of formation of a warm corona, strongly linked to the cold accretion disc underneath. A global amplification of ionizing radiation after approximately 11 years is consistent with propagating heating fronts in inflated accretion discs. Based on our multi-wavelength study on recent data, we propose that Mkn 590 is currently becoming a Seyfert-1, similar to 1990s.</description>

      <title>SN 2023xwi: Forbidden line emission in the peak spectrum of a Ca-strong transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive optical photometric and spectroscopic investigation into the calcium-rich supernova (SN) - SN2023xwi. Observations from a variety of ground-based telescopes follow the SN from 8 days pre-peak brightness to 87 days post-peak, covering both early-time (photospheric) and late-time (nebular) phases of the supernova. Objects of this class are characterised by nebular spectra that are dominated by [Ca II] $\lambda \lambda$ 7291, 7324 emission. SN 2023xwi displays a unique peculiarity in that its forbidden [Ca II] feature is visible in its peak photospheric spectrum - far earlier than expected in current models. This is one of the strongest and earliest detections of this feature in Ca-rich SNe in photospheric-phase spectra. We investigate the velocity evolution of this spectral feature and show that it cannot be easily explained by conventional progenitor systems. From our observations, we propose a SN progenitor embedded in an environment polluted by a recurrent He-nova AM CVn system.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Modelling of Gamma-Ray Burst 090510</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts detected at high energies provide valuable insights into the emission mechanisms behind these still puzzling enigmatic events. In this study, we focus on GRB 090510, which is an unusual short GRB exhibiting plateau emission observed by the Fermi-LAT. Using the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code (HARM), we aim to infer the key properties of this GRB, such as the jet opening angle, the energetics, the Lorentz Gamma factor, the jet structure and its variability, and the progenitor parameters of the compact binary system. We explored both the 2D and 3D models and estimated the variability timescales. Our findings show that the predicted jet opening angle is within $88\%$ of the observed upper limit from observations, and the energetics are in general agreement with observed values when accounting for the evolution of jet opening angle with redshift. This work establishes the foundation for ongoing exploration, which will further align the theoretical model simulations with observational data.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength view of the isolated neutron star eRASSU J065715.3+260428</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray source eRASSU J065715.3+260428 was identified as a likely thermally emitting isolated neutron star in a search in the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. We investigated the nature and evolutionary state of the source through a dedicated multi-wavelength follow-up campaign with XMM-Newton, NICER, FAST, and ESO-VLT, complemented by the analysis of archival Fermi-LAT observations. The X-ray observations unveiled the rotation period, $P=261.085400(4)$ ms, and spin-down rate, $\dot{P}=6^{+11}_{-4}\times10^{-15}$ s s$^{-1}$, of the source. No optical counterparts are detected down to 27.3 mag ($5\sigma$, R band), implying a large X-ray-to-optical flux ratio above 5200. The X-ray spectrum of the source is best described by a composite phenomenological model consisting of two thermal components, either a double blackbody continuum with temperatures 90 eV and 220 eV or a hydrogen neutron star atmosphere of temperature $\log(T/\mathrm{K})\sim 5.8$ combined with a hot blackbody of 250 eV, in both cases modified by an absorption feature at low energies ($\sim0.3$ keV). The presence of faint non-thermal hard X-ray tails is ruled out above $(2.1\pm1.8)$% of the source unabsorbed flux. Radio searches at $1-1.5$ GHz with FAST yielded negative results, with a deep upper limit on the pulsed flux of 1.4 $\mu$Jy ($10\sigma$). Similarly, no significant spatial or pulsed signals were detected in sixteen years of Fermi-LAT observations. The source is most likely a middle-aged spin-powered pulsar and can also be identified as PSR J0657+2604. The absence of non-thermal X-ray, radio, or gamma-ray emission within current limits suggests either an unfavourable viewing geometry or unusual magnetospheric properties. Additional observations are needed to check for faint hard X-ray tails, investigate the presence of diffuse emission from a pulsar-wind nebula, and obtain a more accurately sampled timing solution.</description>

      <title>Science objectives of the Einstein Probe mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Probe (EP) is an interdisciplinary mission of time-domain and X-ray astronomy. Equipped with a wide-field lobster-eye X-ray focusing imager, EP will discover cosmic X-ray transients and monitor the X-ray variability of known sources in 0.5-4 keV, at a combination of detecting sensitivity and cadence that is not accessible to the previous and current wide-field monitoring missions. EP can perform quick characterisation of transients or outbursts with a Wolter-I X-ray telescope onboard. In this paper, the science objectives of the Einstein Probe mission are presented. EP is expected to enlarge the sample of previously known or predicted but rare types of transients with a wide range of timescales. Among them, fast extragalactic transients will be surveyed systematically in soft X-rays, which include {\gamma}-ray bursts and their variants, supernova shock breakouts, and the predicted X-ray transients associated with binary neutron star mergers. EP will detect X-ray tidal disruption events and outbursts from active galactic nuclei, possibly at an early phase of the flares for some. EP will monitor the variability and outbursts of X-rays from white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in our and neighbouring galaxies at flux levels fainter than those detectable by the current instruments, and is expected to discover new objects. A large sample of stellar X-ray flares will also be detected and characterised. In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, EP has the potential of detecting the possible X-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, neutrino sources, and ultra-high energy {\gamma}-ray and cosmic ray sources. EP is expected to help advance the studies of extreme objects/phenomena and their underlying physical processes revealed in the dynamic X-ray universe, as well as studies in other areas of X-ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for computing the afterglow emission. Our procedure is general and applicable to any jet simulation of the same kind.</description>

      <title>A Study of thin relativistic magnetic accretion disk around a distorted black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disks, swirling structures of matter spiraling into black holes, play a pivotal role in our understanding of binary star systems and their intricate evolutionary processes. While current models often simplify these complex phenomena by neglecting the influence of powerful magnetic fields, particularly within warped or distorted black hole geometries, this study delves into the crucial impact of such fields. Focusing on a thin accretion disk encircling a Schwarzschild black hole, we meticulously investigate how the presence of a quadrupole moment, an inherent distortion in the black hole's shape, affects its spectral characteristics. By analyzing key parameters like total pressure, magnetic pressure, temperature, height scale, surface density, and radiative flux (the energy emitted by the disk) we reveal significant alterations induced by incorporating both magnetic fields and a quadrupole moment. Notably, our findings demonstrate that negative quadrupoles exert a more pronounced influence on these disk properties, highlighting the intricate interplay between these factors. This comprehensive study provides invaluable insights into the dynamics of accretion disks surrounding distorted black holes with magnetic fields, paving the way for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of these fascinating astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>First mid-infrared detection and modeling of a flare from Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-variable emission from the accretion flow of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, has long been examined in the radio-to-mm, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, until now, sensitivity and angular resolution have been insufficient in the crucial mid-infrared (MIR) regime. The MIRI instrument on JWST has changed that, and we report the first MIR detection of Sgr A*. The detection was during a flare that lasted about 40 minutes, a duration similar to NIR and X-ray flares, and the source's spectral index steepened as the flare ended. The steepening suggests synchrotron cooling is an important process for Sgr A*'s variability and implies magnetic field strengths $\sim$40--70 Gauss in the emission zone. Observations at $1.3~\mathrm{mm}$ with the Submillimeter Array revealed a counterpart flare lagging the MIR flare by $\approx$10 minutes. The observations can be self-consistently explained as synchrotron radiation from a single population of gradually cooling high-energy electrons accelerated through (a combination of) magnetic reconnection and/or magnetized turbulence.</description>

      <title>The GRACE project: Hard X-ray giant radio galaxies and their duty cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of new generation radio telescopes is opening new possibilities on the classification and study of extragalactic high-energy sources, specially the underrepresented ones like radio galaxies. Among these, Giant Radio Galaxies (GRG, larger than 0.7 Mpc) are among the most extreme manifestations of the accretion/ejection processes on supermassive black holes. Our recent studies have shown that GRG can be up to four times more abundant in hard X-ray selected (i.e. from INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT at $&gt;$20 keV) samples and, most interestingly, the majority of them present signs of restarted radio activity. This makes them the ideal test-bed to study the so far unknown duty cycle of jets in active galactic nuclei. Open questions in the field include: How and when jets are restarted? How jets evolve and what's their dynamic? What is the jet's duty cycle and what triggers them? Our group has recently collected a wealth of radio data on these high-energy selected GRGs, allowing us to study their jet formation and evolution from the pc to kpc scales, across different activity epochs. In particular, thanks to our EVN large programme, we were able to probe the new radio phase in the core of these giants. Furthermore, we are devoting an effort to the exploitation of new radio surveys data for the discovery of new classes of counterparts of Fermi/LAT catalogues. In particular, we are unveiling the hidden population of radio galaxies associated with gamma-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter halo on transonic accretion flow around a galactic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid, as proposed by Cardoso {\it et al}. We essentially compare the accretion properties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The Cardoso BH is described by the halo mass ($M_{\rm H}$) and its characteristic length scale ($a_0$). Various classes of accretion solution topologies (e.g., O, A, and I-types), including the shock solutions, are obtained by solving the dynamical equations of the flow in a fully general relativistic framework. We find that the accretion solutions are substantially influenced by the halo parameters ($M_{\rm H}, a_0$) when the dark matter distribution is concentrated near the BH horizon. In this context, we also observe that various shock properties, such as the shock radius, flow density compression, and temperature compression across the shock fronts, are potentially affected by the dark halo. Interestingly, the existing shock parameter space, defined by the flow angular momentum and energy, is largely reduced for higher halo compactness compared to that of the Schwarzschild BH. Furthermore, different observational signatures of the accretion disc, like the spectral energy distribution (SED), slope of the SED, and bolometric luminosity, are found to exhibit strong deviations from the known results in the usual Schwarzschild BH model. These unique features offer a possible valuable tool for characterizing the presence or absence of a dark matter halo around a galactic BH.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested disk flux eruption events to describe SgrA* flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Magnetically arrested disks are among the most suitable candidates for describing the gas accretion and observed emission in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Aims. This work aims to provide a direct correlation between the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD accretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic center. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct counter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux tubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux tubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by the accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots, formed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they travel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light. Results. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance out the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk and demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with the NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor face-on inclinations in the range $[0^\circ, 34^\circ]$ and $[163^\circ, 180^\circ]$ for SgrA*. Conclusions. The flux eruption events that arise naturally in the MAD accretion state provide a promising framework for reproducing the observed flaring behavior in the vicinity of SgrA*.</description>

      <title>Advection Algorithms for Quantum Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino transport in compact objects is an inherently challenging multi-dimensional problem. This difficulty is compounded if one includes flavor transformation -- an intrinsically quantum phenomenon requiring one to follow the coherence between flavors and thus necessitating the introduction of complex numbers. To reduce the computational burden, simulations of compact objects that include neutrino transport often make use of momentum-angle-integrated moments (the lowest order ones being commonly referred to as the energy density and flux) and these quantities can be generalized to include neutrino flavor, i.e., they become quantum moments. Numerous finite-volume approaches to solving the moment evolution equations for classical neutrino transport have been developed based on solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces. In this paper we describe our generalization of a Riemann solver for quantum moments, specifically decomposing complex numbers in terms of a (signed) magnitude and phase instead of real and imaginary parts. We then test our new algorithm in numerous cases showing a neutrino fast flavor instability, varying from toy models with analytic solutions to snapshots from neutron star merger simulations. Compared to previous algorithms for neutrino transport with flavor mixing, we find uniformly smaller growth rates of the flavor transformation along with concomitantly larger length-scales, and that the results are a better match with the growth rates seen from multi-angle codes.</description>

      <title>The Guitar's Magnetic Field Revealed by Starlight Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Guitar nebula surrounding PSR B2224+65 boasts a pulsar X-ray filament likely aligned with the local magnetic field. We present new RoboPol stellar polarization data distributed along the line-of-sight to the pulsar. The polarizing effect of intervening magnetized dust allows us to extract a model for the dust-weighted magnetic field. We detect a magnetic field angle consistent with the filament if the pulsar is located in the more distant zone of its parallax-estimated distance range.</description>

      <title>Resolution Limiting Factors in Low-Energy Cascade Zenith Reconstruction with the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory includes low energy extensions such as the existing DeepCore subarray and the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, which will consist of seven new strings of photosensors with denser instrumentation than the existing array. The setup will allow for the study of neutrino oscillations with greater sensitivity compared to the existing instrumentation, improve neutrino mass ordering studies, and test for the unitarity of the PMNS mixing matrix with high precision. A critical component in these low-energy physics analyses is the accurate reconstruction of event information, particularly the zenith angle of incoming neutrinos. In this study, we discuss the processes that limit the zenith resolution, which include the transverse spread of the hadronic shower, in-ice photon scattering, module resolutions, and module noise. By considering approximations to these processes, we aim to approach the intrinsic zenith resolution limits for purely hadronic events.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Preserving Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Spectral Two-Moment Radiation Transport in Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a realizability-preserving numerical method for solving a spectral two-moment model to simulate the transport of massless, neutral particles interacting with a steady background material moving with relativistic velocities. The model is obtained as the special relativistic limit of a four-momentum-conservative general relativistic two-moment model. Using a maximum-entropy closure, we solve for the Eulerian-frame energy and momentum. The proposed numerical method is designed to preserve moment realizability, which corresponds to moments defined by a nonnegative phase-space density. The realizability-preserving method is achieved with the following key components: (i) a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) phase-space discretization with specially constructed numerical fluxes in the spatial and energy dimensions; (ii) a strong stability-preserving implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-integration method; (iii) a realizability-preserving conserved to primitive moment solver; (iv) a realizability-preserving implicit collision solver; and (v) a realizability-enforcing limiter. Component (iii) is necessitated by the closure procedure, which closes higher order moments nonlinearly in terms of primitive moments. The nonlinear conserved to primitive and the implicit collision solves are formulated as fixed-point problems, which are solved with custom iterative solvers designed to preserve the realizability of each iterate. With a series of numerical tests, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this DG-IMEX method.</description>

      <title>Efficient Framework for Solving Plasma Waves with Arbitrary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma, which constitutes 99\% of the visible matter in the universe, is characterized by a wide range of waves and instabilities that play a pivotal role in space physics, astrophysics, laser-plasma interactions, fusion research, and laboratory experiments. The linear physics of these phenomena is described by kinetic dispersion relations (KDR). However, solving KDRs for arbitrary velocity distributions remains a significant challenge, particularly for non-Maxwellian distributions frequently observed in various plasma environments. This work introduces a novel, efficient, and unified numerical framework to address this challenge. The proposed method rapidly and accurately yields all significant solutions of KDRs for nearly arbitrary velocity distributions, supporting both unstable and damped modes across all frequencies and wavevectors. The approach expands plasma species' velocity distribution functions using a series of carefully chosen orthogonal basis functions and employs a highly accurate rational approximation to transform the problem into an equivalent matrix eigenvalue problem, eliminating the need for initial guesses. The efficiency and versatility of this framework are demonstrated, enabling simplified studies of plasma waves with arbitrary distributions. This advancement paves the way for uncovering new physics in natural plasma environments, such as spacecraft observations in space plasmas, and applications like wave heating in fusion research.</description>

      <title>Constraining the curvature-induced quantum gravity scales via gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters that govern curvature-induced quantum gravity time-of-flight (TOF) effects. These TOF delays, which occur due to modified dispersion relations of particles in a vacuum, could be a phenomenological signature of quantum gravity. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), short, high-energy events from distant galaxies, offer a unique opportunity to impose observational limits on TOF delays and, by extension, on the energy scales of quantum gravity. Using the standard Jacob-Piran relation, which assumes a locally-flat spacetime, the analysis of quantum gravity-induced TOF effects establishes a lower limit of approximately 10 Planck energies on the energy scale of these effects. However, curvature-induced quantum gravity effects may introduce additional contributions. From current GRB observations, we find that, at a 95% credibility level, in the symmetry-deformed scenario, curvature-induced TOF effects may only arise at energies above 0.04 Planck energy. If we consider only curvature-induced effects, this limit is an order of magnitude stronger. Observing more GRBs at different redshifts could improve the constraints on the curvature-induced QG phenomena. However, given the capabilities of current telescopes and the current understanding of GRBs, it is unlikely that these constraints will be significantly extended beyond the present level.</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures beyond Newton: exploring hierarchical three-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical three-body systems offer a compelling framework to explore the subtle interplay between Newtonian and relativistic gravitational effects in astrophysical environments. In this work, we investigate post-Newtonian corrections to the periastron shift within such systems, focusing on the impact of orbital eccentricity and relativistic modifications to the center of mass. Modeling the secondary body's influence as a quadrupolar perturbation, we rigorously compare Newtonian, Schwarzschild, and post-Newtonian quadrupolar contributions to orbital precession. Our analysis demonstrates that Newtonian quadrupolar effects could be observable in the orbit of the S87 star around Sagittarius A* if an intermediate-mass black hole is present. Additionally, post-Newtonian quadrupolar corrections, though subtle, may notably influence the dynamics of small Solar System bodies in the presence of massive companions. These findings provide critical insights into detecting relativistic corrections in astrophysical systems with current high-precision instruments, such as GRAVITY. By bridging classical and relativistic dynamics, this study enhances our understanding of gravitational interactions in multi-body systems and paves the way for testing general relativity in the complex gravitational fields of galactic nuclei and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>State-space algorithm for detecting the nanohertz gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA). Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data, in which the stochastic gravitational wave strain at Earth is tracked with a non-linear Kalman filter and separated simultaneously from intrinsic, achromatic pulsar spin wandering. The filter is combined with a nested sampler to estimate the parameters of the model, and to calculate a Bayes factor for selecting between models with and without a SGWB. The procedure extends previous state-space formulations of PTA data analysis applied to individually resolvable binary black hole sources. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$, where $A_{\rm gw}$ denotes the standard normalization factor for a power spectral density with power-law exponent $-13/3$. Additional, systematic validation tests are also performed with synthetic data generated independently by adjusting the injected parameters to cover astrophysically plausible ranges. Full posterior distributions are recovered and tested for accuracy. The state-space procedure is memory-light and evaluates the likelihood for a standard-sized PTA dataset in $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ s without optimization on a standard central processing unit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define two regimes of the parameter space of symbiotic systems based on the dominant mass transfer mechanism. A wide range of white dwarf (WD) mass, donor mass, and donor radius combinations are explored to determine the separation, for each parameter combination, below which wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF) will be the dominant mass transfer mechanism. The underlying concept is the premise that the wind accelerates. If it reaches the Roche-lobe before attaining sufficient velocity to escape, it will be trapped, and gravitationally focused through the inner Lagrangian point towards the accreting WD. However, if the wind succeeds in attaining the required velocity to escape from the donor's Roche-lobe, it will disperse isotropically, and the dominant mass transfer mechanism will be the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescription in which only a fraction of the wind will be accreted onto the WD. We present, these two regimes of the four dimensional parameter space, covering 375 different parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extended axion structures from the lensing of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that have been regarded as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. On the other hand, extended compact objects such as axion stars, which are supported by gravity and axion self interactions, may have also been formed in the early Universe and comprise part of DM. In this work, we consider the lensing of electromagnetic signals from distant sources by axion stars, as a way to constrain the properties of axion stars and fundamental axion parameters. Accounting for the effect of the finite size of the axion star, we study the lensing effect induced by gravity and the axion-photon coupling. The latter effect is frequency dependent, and is relevant in the low frequency band, which motivates the use of fast radio burst (FRB) signals as a probe. We calculate the predicted number of lensed FRB events by specifying the fundamental axion parameters, axion star radial profile, fraction of DM residing in axion stars, and imposing lensing criteria based on the flux ratio and time delay between the brightest images from lensing. Assuming an optimistic case of $10^4$ observed FRB events, and a timing resolution of $1~\mu{\rm s}$, the lack of observed FRB lensing events in CHIME allows us to probe axion stars with mass $ \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{-2} M_\odot$, corresponding to axion masses $\lesssim 10^{-10}{\rm eV}$. We obtain constraints for even lighter axion stars up to $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot$, when the axion-photon interactions are taken into account. Our results indicate that FRB lensing lead to constraints that are competitive with conventional microlensing searches operating in the optical band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The intense X-ray and UV emission of some active M stars has raised questions about the habitability of planets around M-type stars. Aims. We aim to determine the unbiased distribution of X-ray luminosities in complete, volume-limited samples of nearby M dwarfs, and compare them to those of K and G dwarfs. Methods. We constructed volume-complete samples of 205 M stars with a spectral type $\leq$ M6 within 10 pc of the Sun, 129 K stars within 16 pc, and 107 G stars within 20 pc. We used X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, eROSITA, and ROSAT to obtain the X-ray luminosities of the stars. Results. Our samples reach an X-ray detection completeness of 85%, 86%, and 80% for M, K, and G stars, respectively. The fractional X-ray luminosities relative to the bolometric luminosities, $\log(L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol})$, of the M stars show a bimodal distribution, with one peak at around -5, mostly contributed by early M stars (M0--M4), and another peak around -3.5, contributed mainly by M4--M6 stars. The comparison of the different spectral classes shows that 63% of all M stars in our sample (80% of the M stars with a spectral type $&lt;$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ values that are within the central 80% quantile of the distribution function for G stars. In addition, 55% of all M stars in our sample (and 72% of the M stars with a spectral type $&lt;$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ less than 10 times the solar value. Conclusions. The X-ray activity levels of the majority ($\ge 60\%$) of nearby M dwarfs no later than M6 are actually not higher than the typical (80% quantile) levels for G-type stars. The X-ray irradiation of habitable-zone planets around these stars should therefore not present a specific problem for their habitability.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories.</description>

      <title>Exploring Temperature Influences on Gravitational Wave Production in Binary White Dwarfs</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the conditions under which gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted during the merger of hot white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary system. Traditionally, these systems consist of two low-mass stars or a more massive WD paired with a less massive companion. In addition, recent work has investigated the possibility that double white dwarf (DWD) mergers are possibly the leading formation channel of massive, rapidly rotating, high-field magnetic WDs , particularly SDSS J221141.80 + 113604.4 (hereafter J2211+1136) and ZTF J190132.9 + 145808.7 (hereafter J1901 + 14588). Motivated by these findings and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) prospects, this study aims to calculate the tidal Love number, the dimensionless tidal deformability, as well as the frequency and amplitude of GWs of hot WDs. The results indicate that the tidal deformability is more pronounced in stars with higher central temperatures and lower masses, which would lead to reduced emission of GWs. In contrast, more massive stars exhibit less deformability, making them prime candidates for generating stronger GWs. Additionally, the analysis of frequency and amplitude reveals that the frequencies of high-mass binaries are smaller and evolve more rapidly, reaching a limit that aligns with the operational detection capabilities of LISA during its initial phase.</description>

      <title>From Out of the Blue: Swift Links 2002es-like, 2003fg-like, and Early-Time Bump Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We collect a sample of 42 SNe Ia with Swift UV photometry and well-measured early-time light curve rises and find that 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia have different pre-peak UV color evolutions compared to normal SNe Ia and other spectroscopic subtypes. Specifically, 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia are cleanly separated from other SNe Ia subtypes by UVM2-UVW1&gt;=1.0~mag at 10 days prior to B-band maximum. Furthermore, the SNe Ia that exhibit non-monotonic bumps in their rising light curves, to date, consist solely of 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia. We also find that SNe Ia with two-component power-law rises are more luminous than SNe Ia with single-component power-law rises at pre-peak epochs. Given the similar UV colors, along with other observational similarities, we discuss a possible progenitor scenario that places 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia along a continuum and may explain the unique UV colors, early-time bumps, and other observational similarities between these objects. Ultimately, further observations of both subtypes, especially in the near-infrared, are critical for constraining models of these peculiar thermonuclear explosions.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Follow-up of ASASSN-23bd (AT 2023clx): The Lowest Redshift and Least Luminous Tidal Disruption Event To Date</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae discovery of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-23bd (AT 2023clx) in NGC 3799, a LINER galaxy with no evidence of strong AGN activity over the past decade. With a redshift of $z = 0.01107$ and a peak UV/optical luminosity of $(5.4\pm0.4)\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, ASASSN-23bd is the lowest-redshift and least-luminous TDE discovered to date. Spectroscopically, ASASSN-23bd shows H$\alpha$ and He I emission throughout its spectral time series, and the UV spectrum shows nitrogen lines without the strong carbon and magnesium lines typically seen for AGN. Fits to the rising ASAS-SN light curve show that ASASSN-23bd started to brighten on MJD 59988$^{+1}_{-1}$, $\sim$9 days before discovery, with a nearly linear rise in flux, peaking in the $g$ band on MJD $60000^{+3}_{-3}$. Scaling relations and TDE light curve modelling find a black hole mass of $\sim$10$^6$ $M_\odot$, which is on the lower end of supermassive black hole masses. ASASSN-23bd is a dim X-ray source, with an upper limit of $L_{0.3-10\,\mathrm{keV}} &lt; 1.0\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from stacking all \emph{Swift} observations prior to MJD 60061, but with soft ($\sim 0.1$ keV) thermal emission with a luminosity of $L_{0.3-2 \,\mathrm{keV}}\sim4\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in \emph{XMM-Newton} observations on MJD 60095. The rapid $(t &lt; 15$ days) light curve rise, low UV/optical luminosity, and a luminosity decline over 40 days of $\Delta L_{40}\approx-0.7$ make ASASSN-23bd one of the dimmest TDEs to date and a member of the growing ``Low Luminosity and Fast'' class of TDEs.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are one of the most energetic phenomena in the cosmos, whose study probes physics extremes beyond the reach of laboratories on Earth. Our quest to unravel the origin of these events and understand their underlying physics is far from complete. Central to this pursuit is the rapid classification of GRBs to guide follow-up observations and analysis across the electromagnetic spectrum and beyond. Here, we introduce a compelling approach that can set milestone towards a new and robust GRB prompt classification method. Leveraging self-supervised deep learning, we pioneer a previously unexplored data product to approach this task: the GRB waterfalls.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Origin of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts with or without Extended Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star - neutron star (BNS) and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW 170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. The offset is the distance between the GRB sky localization and the host galaxy center. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples (46 sGRBs with EE and 9 without EE samples) and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing non-parametric methods, we examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without any assuming. The luminosity function can be described as $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.12 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.73 \pm 0.02}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for sGRB without EE and $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.13 \pm 0.003}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.61 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-3.04 \pm 0.10}$ for $z &lt; 1$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.29 \pm 0.38}$ for $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$ for sGRB without EE, while for sGRBs with EE, it is $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-3.85 \pm 0.15}$ for $z &lt; 1$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.40 \pm 1.11}$ for $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$. Our findings suggest no significant difference in the progenitors of sGRBs with and without EE when considered in terms of spatial offsets, formation rates, and luminosity function.</description>

      <title>Investigating cannibalistic millisecond pulsar binaries using MESA: New constraints from pulsar spin and mass evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with orbital periods $\lesssim1$d are key to understanding binary evolution involving massive neutron stars (NSs). Due to the ablation of the companion by the rapidly spinning pulsar, these systems are also known as spiders and categorized into two main branches: redbacks (RBs; companion mass in the range of 0.1 to 0.5\,\Msun) and black widows (BWs; companion mass $\lesssim$\,0.1\,\Msun). We present models of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries and compare them with observations of Galactic spiders (including the presence or absence of hydrogen lines in their optical spectra), and we constrain and quantify the interaction between the pulsar and the companion. Using MESA, we created the allowed initial parameter space. For the first time in MESA, we also included the detailed evolution of the pulsar spin and modeled the irradiation of the companion by the pulsar wind. Efficient mass accretion onto the NS (at least $70\%$ of the mass transferred is accreted) with an X-ray irradiated disk followed by strong irradiation of the companion can explain most of the properties of the observed spiders. Our RB evolutionary tracks continue to the BW regime, connecting the two branches of spiders. Our models explain the lack of hydrogen in some observed BWs with ultra-light companions. During accretion induced spin up, the mass required to spin up an NS to sub-milliseconds is high enough to collapse it into a black hole. Finally, after analyzing the formation of RB-like spiders with giant companions and orbital periods of several days (huntsmen), we conclude that they are unlikely to produce super-massive NSs (maximum accreted mass $\lesssim$0.5M$_{\odot}$). Cannibalistic MSP binary formation depends heavily on the interplay between accretion onto the pulsar and pulsar wind irradiation.</description>

      <title>Life in the Bubble: How a Nearby Supernova Left Ephemeral Footprints on the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum and Indelible Imprints on Life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth sits inside a 300pc-wide void that was carved by a series of supernova explosions that went off tens of millions of years ago, pushing away interstellar gas and creating a bubble-like structure. The $^{60}$Fe peak deposits found in the deep-sea crust have been interpreted by the imprints left by the ejecta of supernova explosions occurring about 2-3 and 5-6 Myr ago. It is likely that the $^{60}$Fe peak at about 2-3 Myr originated from a supernova occurring in the Upper Centaurus Lupus association in Scorpius Centaurus ($\approx$140 pc) or the Tucana Horologium association ($\approx$70 pc). Whereas, the $\approx$ 5-6 Myr peak is likely attributed to the solar system's entrance into the bubble. In this {\it Letter}, we show that the supernova source responsible for synthesizing the $^{60}$Fe peak deposits $\approx$ 2-3 Myr ago can consistently explain the cosmic-ray spectrum and the large-scale anisotropy between 100 TeV and 100 PeV. The cosmic-ray knee could then potentially be attributed entirely to a single nearby "Pevatron" source. Matching the intensity and shape of the cosmic-ray spectrum allows us to place stringent constraints on the cosmic-ray energy content from the supernova as well as on the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient. Making use of such constraints we provide a robust estimate of the temporal variation of terrestrial ionizing cosmic radiation levels and discuss their implications in the development of early life on Earth by plausibly influencing the mutation rate and, as such, conceivably assisting in the evolution of complex organisms.</description>

      <title>Extreme scale height variations and nozzle shocks in warped disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion disks around both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes are likely often warped. Whenever a disk is warped, its scale height varies with azimuth. Sufficiently strong warps cause extreme compressions of the scale height, which fluid parcels "bounce" off of twice per orbit to high latitudes. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such strong warps using two methods: (i) the nearly analytic "ring theory" of Fairbairn &amp; Ogilvie (2021a), which we generalize to the Kerr metric; and (ii) 3D general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of tori ("rings") around black holes, using the H-AMR code. We initialize a ring with a warp and study the subsequent evolution on tens of orbital periods. The simulations agree excellently with the ring theory until the warp amplitude, $\psi$, reaches a critical value $\psi_{\rm c}$. When $\psi&gt;\psi_{\rm c}$, the rings enter the bouncing regime. We analytically derive (and numerically validate) that $\psi_{\rm c}\approx (r/r_{\rm g})^{-1/2}$ in the non-Keplerian regime, where $r_{\rm g}=GM/c^2$ is the gravitational radius and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Whenever the scale height bounces, the vertical velocity becomes supersonic, which leads to a "nozzle shock" as the gas collides at the scale height minima. Nozzle shocks damp the warp within $\approx10-20$ orbits in the simulations; but, that damping is not captured by the ring theory. Nozzle shock dissipation leads to inflow timescales that are 1-2 orders of magnitude shorter than unwarped $\alpha$ disks which may result in rapid variability, such as in changing-look active galactic nuclei or in the soft state of X-ray binaries. We also propose that steady disks with strong enough warps may self-regulate to have amplitudes near $\psi_{\rm c}$.</description>

      <title>H-AMR FORGE'd in FIRE I: Magnetic state transitions, jet launching and radiative emission in super-Eddington, highly magnetized quasar disks formed from cosmological initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01877v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasars are powered by supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disks, yet standard disk models are inconsistent with many quasar observations. Recently, Hopkins et al. (2024) simulated the formation of a quasar disk feeding a SMBH of mass $M=1.3\times10^7\,M_\odot$ in a host galaxy that evolved from cosmological initial conditions. The disk had surprisingly strong toroidal magnetic fields that supported it vertically from gravity and powered fast accretion. What radiation and feedback can such a system produce? To answer this, we must follow the gas to the event horizon. For this, we interpolated the accretion system onto the grid of the general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code H-AMR and performed 3D simulations with BH spins $a=0$ and $a=0.9375$. This remapping generates spurious magnetic monopoles, which we erase using a novel divergence cleaning approach. Despite the toroidal magnetic field's dominance at large radii, vertical magnetic flux builds up at the event horizon. This causes a magnetic state transition within the inner $200$ gravitational radii of the disk, where net vertical magnetic flux begins dominating the accretion flow. This powers strong winds and, if the BH spins, relativistic jets that can spin-down the BH within $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. Sometimes, vertical magnetic fields of opposite sign reach the BH, causing polarity inversion events that briefly destroy the jets and, possibly, the X-ray corona. The disk powers accretion at rates $5\times$ the Eddington limit, which can double the BH mass in $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. When $a=0.9375$ ($a=0$), the energy in outflows and radiation equals about $60\%$ ($10\%$) and $100\%$ ($3\%$) of the accreted rest mass energy, respectively. Much of the light escapes in cool, extended $\gtrsim1300\,{\rm au}$ photospheres, consistent with quasar microlensing and the ``big blue bump'' seen in spectral energy distributions.</description>

      <title>Off-centre ignition of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs does not resolve the tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation of type Ia supernovae</title>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but the exact nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The resulting explosion resembles a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD), which is known to be in tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, where $t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ (the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass). SCD predicts an anticorrelation between $t_0$ and $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$, with $t_0\mathord{\approx}30\,\textrm{day}$ for luminous ($M_{\rm{Ni}56}\gtrsim0.5\,M_{\odot}$) SNe Ia, while the observed $t_0$ is in the range of 35-45 day. In this study, we apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate in 2D the impact of off-centre ignition in sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD, aiming to better emulate the behaviour expected in the DDM scenario. Our calculations of the $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, which do not require radiation transfer calculations, achieve convergence to within a few per cent with a numerical resolution of $\mathord{\sim}1\,\rm{km}$. We find that the results only slightly depend on the ignition location, mirroring the SCD model, and consequently, the discrepancy with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation remains unresolved.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of our multi-wavelength (X-ray to radio) follow-up campaign of the Einstein Probe transient EP240408a. The initial 10 s trigger displayed bright soft X-ray (0.5-4 keV) radiation with peak luminosity $L_\textrm{X} \gtrsim 10^{49}$ ($10^{50}$) erg s$^{-1}$ for an assumed redshift z&gt;0.5 (2.0). The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR discovered a fading X-ray counterpart lasting for $\sim$5 d (observer frame), which showed a long-lived (~4 d) plateau-like emission ($t^{-0.5}$) before a sharp powerlaw decline ($t^{-7}$). The plateau emission was in excess of $L_\textrm{X} \gtrsim 10^{46}$ ($10^{47}$) erg s$^{-1}$ at z&gt;0.5 (2.0). Deep optical and radio observations resulted in non-detections of the transient. Our observations with Gemini South revealed a faint potential host galaxy ($r \approx 24$ AB mag) near the edge of the X-ray localization. The faint candidate host, and lack of other potential hosts ($r \gtrsim 26$ AB mag; $J \gtrsim 23$ AB mag), implies a higher redshift origin (z&gt;0.5), which produces extreme X-ray properties that are inconsistent with many known extragalactic transient classes. In particular, the lack of a bright gamma-ray counterpart, with the isotropic-equivalent energy ($10 - 10,000$ keV) constrained by GECam and Konus-Wind to $E_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}} \lesssim 4\times10^{51}$ ($6\times10^{52}$) erg at z&gt;0.5 (2.0), conflicts with known gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of similar X-ray luminosities. We therefore favor a jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) as the progenitor of EP240408a at z&gt;1.0, possibly caused by the disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole. The alternative is that EP240408a may represent a new, previously unknown class of transient.</description>

      <title>Examining the evolution of the Supersoft X-ray Source RX J0513.9-6951</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) are thought to be accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in close binary systems, with thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. The SSS RX J0513.9-6951 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibits cyclic variations between optical low and high states, which are anti-correlated with its X-ray flux. This behaviour is believed to result from the periodic expansion and contraction of the WD due to variations in the accretion rate in the system. We analyse eight high-resolution XMM and six grating Chandra spectra of RX J0513.9-6951 with our grid of model atmosphere spectra of hot WDs computed under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our aim is to test a contraction model of the source variability by tracking the evolution of the WD properties. The used grid of hot WD model atmospheres spans a wide range of effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}=100-1000\,\rm kK$ in steps of $25\,\rm kK$) and eight values of surface gravity $\log g$. The LMC chemical composition was assumed. The obtained fitting parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, and bolometric luminosity $L$) evolve on the $T_{\rm eff}- \log g$ and $T_{\rm eff}- L$ planes. This evolution follows the model tracks of WDs with masses of $1.05-1.15\,M_{\odot}$ and thermonuclear burning on the surface. The analysis has showed that the optical brightness of the system is lower when the WD is larger, more luminous, and more effectively illuminates the accretion disc. These results contradict the contraction model, which predicts the opposite behaviour of the source. We use a model, that assumes that the far UV/soft X-ray flux is reprocessed into the optical band due to multiple scattering in the cloud system above the accretion disc. More significant illumination can lead to rarefying of the cloud slab, thereby reducing the reprocessing efficiency and making the source fainter in the optical band.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flares: Population Implications, Rates and Prospects for Gamma-Rays, Gravitational Waves and Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetar Giant Flares (MGFs) are the most energetic non-catastrophic transients known to originate from stellar objects. The first discovered events were nearby. In recent years, several extragalactic events have been identified, implying an extremely high volumetric rate. We show that future instruments with a sensitivity $\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ at $\sim 1$ MeV will be dominated by extragalactic MGFs over short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Clear discrimination of MGFs requires intrinsic GRB localization capability to identify host galaxies. As MGFs involve a release of a sizable fraction of the neutron star's magnetic free energy reservoir in a single event, they provide us with invaluable tools for better understanding magnetar birth properties and the evolution of their magnetic fields. A major obstacle is to identify a (currently) small sub-population of MGFs in a larger sample of more energetic and distant sGRBs. We develop the tools to analyze the properties of detected events and their occurrence rate relative to sGRBs. Even with the current (limited) number of events, we can constrain the initial internal magnetic field of a typical magnetar at formation to be $B_0\approx 4\times 10^{14}-2\times 10^{15}$\,G. Larger samples will constrain the distribution of birth fields. We also estimate the contribution of MGFs to the gravitational wave (GW) stochastic background. Depending on the acceleration time of baryon-loaded ejecta involved in MGFs, their GW emission may reach beyond 10~kHz and, if so, will likely dominate over other conventional astrophysical sources in that frequency range.</description>

      <title>GRB241107A: a Giant Flare from a close-by extragalactic Magnetar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results on the short gamma-ray burst GRB 241107A, obtained with the IBIS instrument on board the INTEGRAL satellite. The burst had a duration of about 0.2 s, a fluence of $8 \times 10^{-7}$ erg cm-2 in the 20 keV-10 MeV range and a hard spectrum, characterized by a peak energy of 680 keV. The position of GRB 241107A has been precisely determined because it fell inside the imaging field of view of the IBIS coded mask instrument. The presence of the nearby galaxy PGC 86046 in the 3 arcmin radius error region, suggests that GRB 241107A might be a giant flare from a magnetar rather than a canonical short GRB. For the 4.1 Mpc distance of PGC 86046, the isotropic energy of $1.6 \times 10^{45}$ erg is in agreement with this hypothesis, that is also supported by the time resolved spectral properties similar to those of the few other extragalactic magnetars giant flares detected so far.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\gamma$-ray dissipation site in gravitationally lensed quasar -- PKS 1830$-$211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variable $\gamma$-ray flares upto minute timescales reflect extreme particle acceleration sites. However, for high-redshift blazars, the detection of such rapid variations remains limited by current telescope sensitivities. Gravitationally lensed blazars serve as powerful tools to probe $\gamma$-ray production zones in distant sources, with time delays between lensed signals providing crucial insights into the spatial distribution of emission regions relative to the lens's mass-weighted center. We have utilized 15 years of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data from direction of PKS 1830$-$211 to understand the origin of flaring high-energy production zone at varying flux states. To efficiently estimate the (lensed) time delay, we used a machine learning-based tool - the Gaussian Process regression algorithm, in addition to - Autocorrelation function and Double power spectrum. We found a consistent time delay across all flaring activity states, indicating a similar location for the $\gamma$-ray emission zone, possibly within the radio core. The estimated time delay of approximately 20 days for the five flaring epochs was significantly shorter than previously estimated radio delays. This suggests that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone is closer to the central engine, in contrast to the radio emission zone, which is expected to be much farther away. A linear relationship between lag and magnification has been observed in the identified source and echo flares. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone originates from similar regions away from the site of radio dissipation.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Cavity as Radio Telescope for Galactic Dark Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, as a minimal extension of the Standard Model through an additional Abelian gauge group, may propagate relativistically across the galaxy, originating from dark matter decay or annihilation, thereby contributing to a galactic dark photon background. The generation of dark photons typically favors certain polarization modes, which are dependent on the interactions between dark matter and dark photons. We introduce a framework in which a resonant cavity is utilized to detect and differentiate these polarizations, leveraging the daily variation in expected signals due to the anisotropic distribution of dark photons and the rotation of the Earth. We conduct an experimental search using superconducting radio-frequency cavities, noted for their exceptionally high quality factors, proving them to be effective telescopes for observing galactic dark photons. This approach establishes the most stringent limits yet on the kinetic mixing coefficient between dark photons and electromagnetic photons, thereby unveiling a novel avenue for the indirect search for dark matter via multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Minimum Entropy Indicator for Evaluating Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) can provide high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution data of a large number of radio sources, offering an excellent opportunity for studying radio pulse profiles. However, studying pulse profiles requires the analysis of dispersion measurement (DM). The fitting method tends to make the profile conform to the model, so the fitting method is not suitable for pulse profile research. Indicators are needed to determine the profile closest to the real one, which is the profile discrimination method. This work is based on the definition of Shannon's information entropy, and believes that the pulse profile when the entropy is minimized is the closest to the true profile. This indicator is simple to calculate and can provide help for pulse profile research. This work uses real data from 48 pulsars. By calculating the information entropy of the pulsar profiles under different DMs, the DM corresponding to the minimum entropy is found, thus verifying the validity of the minimum entropy indicator. In terms of the analysis results for the 48 pulsars, the differences with the references are less than 0.5\% for all except 3 stars, and the results for these 3 stars are consistent with older references. The minimum entropy indicator can effectively obtain the DMs of radio pulse signals with low computational complexity, but it cannot be proven to be the optimal criterion. It is suggested to use multiple indicators separately when studying pulse profiles. It can be expected that the optimal indicator can provide information on the radiation mechanism of radio sources.</description>

      <title>gwsnr: A python package for efficient signal-to-noise calculation of gravitational-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection and analysis rely heavily on efficient Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) computation, a critical parameter for identifying and characterizing astrophysical signals from detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The gwsnr Python package addresses the computational challenges in GW research by providing a flexible, user-friendly framework for SNR calculations. It supports diverse detector noise models, waveform approximants, detector configurations, and signal parameters, making it highly adaptable to various research needs. The package introduces innovative methods, including a partial-scaling interpolation technique for spin-less binary systems, a noise-weighted inner product approach with multiprocessing capabilities, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for rapid detection probability estimation of precessing binary black hole systems. Performance is further optimized using numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, enabling significant reductions in execution time. Seamlessly integrating with other tools, such as the ler package, gwsnr is instrumental in simulating detectable compact binary mergers, estimating GW event rates, and analyzing selection effects in hierarchical Bayesian frameworks. This comprehensive toolkit empowers researchers to conduct efficient, precise, and scalable analyses of GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Constraining eV-scale axion-like particle dark matter: insights from the M87 Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can account for the observed dark matter (DM) of the Universe and if their masses are at the eV scale, they can decay into infrared, optical and ultraviolet photons with a decay lifetime larger than the age of the Universe. We analyze multi-wavelength data obtained from the central region of Messier 87 (M87) galaxy by several telescopes, such as, Swift, Astrosat, Kanata, Spitzer and International Ultraviolet Explorer in the infrared to ultraviolet frequencies ($\sim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm Hz} - 3\times10^{15}$ Hz), to constrain the narrow emission lines indicative of the eV scale ALP DM decay. We derive constraints on the ALP coupling to two photons ($g_{a\gamma\gamma}$) for ALP mass range $2 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$, assuming ALPs form the DM in the M87 halo. We find that our bounds on ALP-two-photon coupling can become stronger than the existing ones by an order of magnitude in the ALP mass range $8 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>TransientVerse: A Comprehensive Real-Time Alert and Multi-Wavelength Analysis System for Transient Astronomical Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient astrophysical events are characterized by short timescales, high energy, and multi-wavelength radiation, often accompanied by violent energy releases. These phenomena are a major focus of modern astronomical research. To reveal their underlying physical mechanisms, near-real-time, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger follow-up observations are essential. However, current transient alert systems face multiple challenges, including fragmented messages, inconsistent formats, and difficulties in retrospective analysis, all of which hinder the efficiency of triggering observations. This paper presents \textbf{TransientVerse}, an innovative real-time database platform to integrate and disseminate transient alerts. The platform uses an automated pipeline to integrate real-time alerts from multiple sources (e.g., ATel, VOEvent, and GCN). It structures unstructured text data into a dual-format database for transient alerts by using open-source large language models. TransientVerse offers retrospective searches, data visualization, literature reviews, and customized subscriptions for efficient event tracking and analysis. Additionally, for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), the platform provides real-time statistics on repeat burst rates across different time intervals and alerts astronomers about high-frequency burst sources, enabling rapid follow-up observations and optimizing the use of limited observation windows. TransientVerse improves the efficiency of acquiring transient events in real time, lowers the technical barriers for simultaneous observations, and provides robust technical support for multi-wavelength, multi-messenger time-domain astronomy and astrophysics studies.</description>
