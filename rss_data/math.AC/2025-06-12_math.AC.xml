      <title>A note concerning the ($S_3$) condition for roots in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to record the following curious fact: let $S$ be an unramified regular local ring of mixed characteristic $p&gt;0$. Let $L$ denote the quotient field of $S$ and $K=L(\omega)$ with $\omega^p\in L$. Let $R$ denote the integral closure of $S$ in $K$. Then $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if $R$ satisfies Serre's condition $(S_3)$, i.e., the obstruction to the Cohen-Macaulayness of $R$ is in codimension three.</description>

      <title>Tangent Cones of Concatenated Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tangent cone at the origin and the Hilbert series for a family of numerical semigroups generated by concatenation of arithmetic sequences. We prove that all the concatenation classes have Cohen-Macaulay tangent cones except the symmetric class, however, the symmetric class does satisfy Rossi's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Generic models of licci ideals parametrized by Schur functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. Licci ideals are the ideals of R that can be linked in a finite number of steps to a complete intersection. Each licci ideal admits a rigid deformation, and two licci ideals are in the same Herzog class if they have a common deformation. In this work, we show how all the Herzog classes of licci ideals of codimension 3 can be parametrized in terms of pairs of partitions associated to Schur functors. This fact allows to describe in a purely combinatorial way the (infinite) graph whose vertices correspond to Herzog classes and edges represent direct links between representatives of such classes. As applications, we obtain results on the classification of multiplications in Tor Algebras, and new structure theorems for families of licci ideals. In the final section, we extend many of these results to arbitrary codimension, but under some conjectural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Ideals generated by corner-interval minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study binomial ideals generated by an arbitrary collection of corner-interval $2$-minors of a generic matrix. We determine the minimal prime ideals of such ideals and characterize their radicality in the special case of corner minors. Moreover, we discuss connectivity properties of contingency tables in algebraic statistics. We compute the Hilbert-Poincar\'e polynomial of the ideal generated by the set of all corner-interval minors and we derive the formula for the regularity in the case of corner minors.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Weighted, Data-Driven Normalization for Approximate Border Bases -- Concept and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the concept and the computation of approximately vanishing ideals of a finite set of data points. By data points, we mean that the points contain some uncertainty, which is a key motivation for the approximate treatment. A careful review of the existing border basis concept for an exact treatment motivates a new adaptation of the border basis concept for an approximate treatment. In the study of approximately vanishing polynomials, the normalization of polynomials plays a vital role. So far, the most common normalization in computational commutative algebra uses the coefficient norm of a polynomial. Inspired by recent developments in machine learning, the present paper proposes and studies the use of gradient-weighted normalization. The gradient-weighted semi-norm evaluates the gradient of a polynomial at the data points. This data-driven nature of gradient-weighted normalization produces, on the one hand, better stability against perturbation and, on the other hand, very significantly, invariance of border bases with respect to scaling the data points. Neither property is achieved with coefficient normalization. In particular, we present an example of the lack of scaling invariance with respect to coefficient normalization, which can cause an approximate border basis computation to fail. This is extremely relevant because scaling of the point set is often recommended for preprocessing the data. Further, we use an existing algorithm with coefficient normalization to show that it is easily adapted to gradient-weighted normalization. The analysis of the adapted algorithm only requires tiny changes, and the time complexity remains the same. Finally, we present numerical experiments on three affine varieties to demonstrate the superior stability of our data-driven normalization over coefficient normalization. We obtain robustness to perturbations and invariance to scaling.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher. In this paper, we present a new implementation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We further introduce the notion of an "oracle function" as a general predictive tool for deciding whether the evaluation of a new variable is necessary to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function. Finally, we apply the multistep solving strategy to the cryptanalysis of the low-latency block cipher Aradi, recently introduced by the NSA. We present the first full round algebraic attack, raising concerns about the cipher's actual security with respect to its key length.</description>

      <title>Invariant theory for wreath products acting on superpolynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite group $G$ acting linearly on the variables $V$ of a polynomial algebra, or an exterior algebra, or superpolynomial algebra with both commuting and anticommuting variables. In this setting, the Hilbert series for the $G$-invariant subalgebra turns out to determine the analogous Hilbert series for the wreath product $P[G]$ acting on $V^n$ for any permutation group $P$ inside the symmetric group $S_n$ on $n$ letters.
  This leads to a structural result: one can collate the direct sum for all $n$ of the $S_n[G]$-invariant subalgebras to form a graded ring via an external shuffle product, whose structure turns out to be a superpolynomial algebra generated by the $G$-invariants. A parallel statement holds for the direct sum of all $S_n[G]$-antiinvariants, which forms a graded ring via an external signed shuffle product, isomorphic to the superexterior algebra generated by the $G$-invariants.</description>
