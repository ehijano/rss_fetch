      <title>Deep Learning Enhanced Multi-Day Turnover Quantitative Trading Algorithm for Chinese A-Share Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sophisticated multi-day turnover quantitative trading algorithm that integrates advanced deep learning techniques with comprehensive cross-sectional stock prediction for the Chinese A-share market. Our framework combines five interconnected modules: initial stock selection through deep cross-sectional prediction networks, opening signal distribution analysis using mixture models for arbitrage identification, market capitalization and liquidity-based dynamic position sizing, grid-search optimized profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms, and multi-granularity volatility-based market timing models. The algorithm employs a novel approach to balance capital efficiency with risk management through adaptive holding periods and sophisticated entry/exit timing. Trained on comprehensive A-share data from 2010-2020 and rigorously backtested on 2021-2024 data, our method achieves remarkable performance with 15.2\% annualized returns, maximum drawdown constrained below 5\%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.87. The strategy demonstrates exceptional scalability by maintaining 50-100 daily positions with a 9-day maximum holding period, incorporating dynamic profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms that enhance capital turnover efficiency while preserving risk-adjusted returns. Our approach exhibits robust performance across various market regimes while maintaining high capital capacity suitable for institutional deployment.</description>

      <title>\textit{QuantMCP}: Grounding Large Language Models in Verifiable Financial Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time, verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data, thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible, and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM applications in finance.</description>

      <title>The Hype Index: an NLP-driven Measure of Market News Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using the S&amp;P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1) their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power for short-term market movements, and (4) their empirical properties including correlations, samplings, and trends. Our findings suggest that the Hype Index family provides a valuable set of tools for stock volatility analysis, market signaling, and NLP extensions in Finance.</description>

      <title>FinBERT2: A Specialized Bidirectional Encoder for Bridging the Gap in Finance-Specific Deployment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources, such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1) Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models (Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3) Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the LLMs era.</description>

      <title>LLMs as World Models: Data-Driven and Human-Centered Pre-Event Simulation for Disaster Impact Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial, socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales. Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Norm: A Survey of Synthetic Data Generation for Rare Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data, yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes, windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges, providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Probabilistic Framework for Learning with Hard Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework, ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup that connects these seemingly disparate domains.</description>

      <title>ChemAgent: Enhancing LLMs for Chemistry and Materials Science through Tree-Search Based Tool Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks, offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for advanced chemical applications.

      <title>FreeGave: 3D Physics Learning from Dynamic Videos by Gaussian Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks, existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in training.</description>

Abstract: Many numerical simulation tools have been developed and are on the market, but there is still a strong need for appropriate tools capable of simulating multi-field problems, especially in aeroacoustics. Therefore, openCFS provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. Since 2000, the software has been developed continuously. The result is openCFS (before 2020, known as CFS++ Coupled Field Simulations written in C++). In this paper, we present pyCFS-data, a data processing framework written in Python to provide a flexible and easy-to-use toolbox to access and manipulate, pre- and postprocess data generated by or for usage with openCFS.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Canonicalization for Fast and Accurate Crystal Tensor Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the tensor properties of crystalline materials is a fundamental task in materials science. Unlike single-value property prediction, which is inherently invariant, tensor property prediction requires maintaining O(3) group tensor equivariance. Such equivariance constraint often requires specialized architecture designs to achieve effective predictions, inevitably introducing tremendous computational costs. Canonicalization, a classical technique for geometry, has recently been explored for efficient learning with symmetry. In this work, we revisit the problem of crystal tensor property prediction through the lens of canonicalization. Specifically, we demonstrate how polar decomposition, a simple yet efficient algebraic method, can serve as a form of canonicalization and be leveraged to ensure equivariant tensor property prediction. Building upon this insight, we propose a general O(3)-equivariant framework for fast and accurate crystal tensor property prediction, referred to as GoeCTP. By utilizing canonicalization, GoeCTP achieves high efficiency without requiring the explicit incorporation of equivariance constraints into the network architecture. Experimental results indicate that GoeCTP achieves the best prediction accuracy and runs up to 13 times faster compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmarking datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Finite-PINN: A Physics-Informed Neural Network with Finite Geometric Encoding for Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PINN models have demonstrated capabilities in addressing fluid PDE problems, and their potential in solid mechanics is beginning to emerge. This study identifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid mechanics problems. These challenges become evident when comparing the limitations of PINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used in solid mechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a) PINN models generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with the finite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution space utilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the complex geometries often present in solid structures.
  This work presents a PINN architecture for general solid mechanics problems, referred to as the Finite-PINN model. The model is designed to effectively tackle two key challenges, while retaining as much of the original PINN framework as possible. To this end, the Finite-PINN incorporates finite geometric encoding into the neural network inputs, thereby transforming the solution space from a conventional Euclidean space into a hybrid Euclidean-topological space. The model is comprehensively trained using both strong-form and weak-form loss formulations, enabling its application to a wide range of forward and inverse problems in solid mechanics. For forward problems, the Finite-PINN model efficiently approximates solutions to solid mechanics problems when the geometric information of a given structure has been preprocessed. For inverse problems, it effectively reconstructs full-field solutions from very sparse observations by embedding both physical laws and geometric information within its architecture.</description>

      <title>The Value of Battery Energy Storage in the Continuous Intraday Market: Forecast vs. Perfect Foresight Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) can provide flexibility to the power system and capture shortterm price volatility by shifting energy in time through controlled charging and discharging. The highly volatile European continuous intraday (CID) market allows trading until just a few minutes before physical delivery, offering significant earning potential. However, its high trading frequency poses substantial modeling challenges. Accurate modeling of BESSs trading in the CID market is essential to estimate revenue potential and optimize trading strategies. Additionally, comparing CID profits with other spot markets helps determine whether participating in the CID is worthwhile despite its complexity. We propose a forecast-driven model to optimize BESS trading in the CID market. Our strategy employs a rolling window modeling framework to capture market dynamics. Price forecasts for impending CID products are generated at the beginning of each window and used to optimize trading schedules for subsequent execution. We also benchmark our approach across various spot markets, offering a broad cross-market profit comparison. We evaluate our forecast-driven model across different BESS power-to-capacity ratios, comparing it to a perfect-foresight scenario and key CID market indices, such as ID1 and ID3. Using real 2023 German CID data, a 1 MW/1 MWh system adopting our method earns EUR 146 237, only 11% below perfect foresight, surpassing all other markets and indices. Our approach surpasses ID1 and ID3 by over 4% and 32%, respectively, confirming ID1 as a reliable lower-bound estimate for earnings potential in the CID market.</description>

Abstract: This study presents an integrated computational framework that, given synthesis parameters, predicts the resulting microstructural morphology and mechanical response of ceramic aerogel porous materials by combining physics-based simulations with deep learning surrogate models. Lattice Boltzmann simulations are employed to model microstructure formation during material synthesis process, while a finite element model is used to compute the corresponding mechanical properties. To overcome the prohibitive computational demands of repeated physics-based simulations required for characterizing the impact of microstructure randomness on mechanical properties, surrogate models are developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for both microstructure generation and microstructure-property mapping. CNN training is formulated as a Bayesian inference problem to enable uncertainty quantification and provide confidence estimates in surrogate model predictions, under limited training data furnished by physics-based simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the microstructure surrogate model effectively generates microstructural images consistent with the morphology of training data across larger domains. The Bayesian CNN surrogate accurately predicts strain energy for in-distribution microstructures and its generalization capability to interpolated morphologies are further investigated. Finally, the surrogate models are employed for efficient uncertainty propagation, quantifying the influence of microstructural variability on macroscopic mechanical property.</description>

      <title>AlphaAgent: LLM-Driven Alpha Mining with Regularized Exploration to Counteract Alpha Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on discovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex financial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&amp;P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Dynamics of Complex System via Multiscale Diffusion Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of complex systems is crucial for various scientific and engineering applications. The accuracy of predictions depends on the model's ability to capture the intrinsic dynamics. While existing methods capture key dynamics by encoding a low-dimensional latent space, they overlook the inherent multiscale structure of complex systems, making it difficult to accurately predict complex spatiotemporal evolution. Therefore, we propose a Multiscale Diffusion Prediction Network (MDPNet) that leverages the multiscale structure of complex systems to discover the latent space of intrinsic dynamics. First, we encode multiscale features through a multiscale diffusion autoencoder to guide the diffusion model for reliable reconstruction. Then, we introduce an attention-based graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the co-evolution across different scales. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average prediction error reduction of 53.23% compared to baselines, while also exhibiting superior robustness and generalization.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Driven Intermittency and Extreme Events in Turbulent Scalar Transport with a Mean Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Open-FinLLMs: Open Multimodal Large Language Models for Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial LLMs hold promise for advancing financial tasks and domain-specific applications. However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges. To foster innovation and collaboration across academia and industry, we release all codes (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIXIU2-0D70/B1D7/LICENSE) and models under OSI-approved licenses.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Learning Model for Line-integral Diagnostics Across Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid reconstruction of 2D plasma profiles from line-integral measurements is important in nuclear fusion. This paper introduces a physics-informed model architecture called Onion, that can enhance the performance of models and be adapted to various backbone networks. The model under Onion incorporates physical information by a multiplication process and applies the physics-informed loss function according to the principle of line integration. Prediction results demonstrate that the additional input of physical information improves the deep learning model's ability, leading to a reduction in the average relative error E_1 between the reconstruction profiles and the target profiles by approximately 0.84x10^(-2) on synthetic datasets and about 0.06x10^(-2) on experimental datasets. Furthermore, the implementation of the Softplus activation function in the final two fully connected layers improves model performance. This enhancement results in a reduction in the E_1 by approximately 1.06x10^(-2) on synthetic datasets and about 0.11x10^(-2) on experimental datasets. The incorporation of the physics-informed loss function has been shown to correct the model's predictions, bringing the back-projections closer to the actual inputs and reducing the errors associated with inversion algorithms. Besides, we have developed a synthetic data model to generate customized line-integral diagnostic datasets and have also collected soft x-ray diagnostic datasets from EAST and HL-2A. This study achieves reductions in reconstruction errors, and accelerates the development of surrogate models in fusion research.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo: A Machine Learning View on Control Variate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many complex simulation tasks spanning areas such as healthcare, engineering, and finance, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are invaluable due to their unbiased estimates and precise error quantification. Nevertheless, Monte Carlo simulations often become computationally prohibitive, especially for nested, multi-level, or path-dependent evaluations lacking effective variance reduction techniques. While machine learning (ML) surrogates appear as natural alternatives, naive replacements typically introduce unquantifiable biases. We address this challenge by introducing Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo (PEMC), a framework that leverages modern ML models as learned predictors, using cheap and parallelizable simulation as features, to output unbiased evaluation with reduced variance and runtime. PEMC can also be viewed as a "modernized" view of control variates, where we consider the overall computation-cost-aware variance reduction instead of per-replication reduction, while bypassing the closed-form mean function requirement and maintaining the advantageous unbiasedness and uncertainty quantifiability of Monte Carlo.
  We illustrate PEMC's broader efficacy and versatility through three examples: first, equity derivatives such as variance swaps under stochastic local volatility models; second, interest rate derivatives such as swaption pricing under the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) interest-rate model. Finally, we showcase PEMC in a socially significant context - ambulance dispatch and hospital load balancing - where accurate mortality rate estimates are key for ethically sensitive decision-making. Across these diverse scenarios, PEMC consistently reduces variance while preserving unbiasedness, highlighting its potential as a powerful enhancement to standard Monte Carlo baselines.</description>

      <title>Data-driven inventory management for new products: An adjusted Dyna-$Q$ approach with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08109v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for inventory management of newly launched products with no historical demand information. The algorithm follows the classic Dyna-$Q$ structure, balancing the model-free and model-based approaches, while accelerating the training process of Dyna-$Q$ and mitigating the model discrepancy generated by the model-based feedback. Based on the idea of transfer learning, warm-start information from the demand data of existing similar products can be incorporated into the algorithm to further stabilize the early-stage training and reduce the variance of the estimated optimal policy. Our approach is validated through a case study of bakery inventory management with real data. The adjusted Dyna-$Q$ shows up to a 23.7\% reduction in average daily cost compared with $Q$-learning, and up to a 77.5\% reduction in training time within the same horizon compared with classic Dyna-$Q$. By using transfer learning, it can be found that the adjusted Dyna-$Q$ has the lowest total cost, lowest variance in total cost, and relatively low shortage percentages among all the benchmarking algorithms under a 30-day testing.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Aspects of Strategic Trading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading in modern financial markets is widely acknowledged to exhibit strategic, game-theoretic behaviors whose complexity can be difficult to model. A recent series of papers (Chriss, 2024b,c,a, 2025) has made progress in the setting of trading for position building. Here parties wish to buy or sell a fixed number of shares in a fixed time period in the presence of both temporary and permanent market impact, resulting in exponentially large strategy spaces. While these papers primarily consider the existence and structural properties of equilibrium strategies, in this work we focus on the algorithmic aspects of the proposed model. We give an efficient algorithm for computing best responses, and show that while the temporary impact only setting yields a potential game, best response dynamics do not generally converge for the general setting, for which no fast algorithm for (Nash) equilibrium computation is known. This leads us to consider the broader notion of Coarse Correlated Equilibria (CCE), which we show can be computed efficiently via an implementation of Follow the Perturbed Leader (FTPL). We illustrate the model and our results with an experimental investigation, where FTPL exhibits interesting behavior in different regimes of the relative weighting between temporary and permanent market impact.</description>

      <title>AI-based Framework for Robust Model-Based Connector Mating in Robotic Wire Harness Installation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of industrial robots in automotive assembly, wire harness installation remains a largely manual process, as it requires precise and flexible manipulation. To address this challenge, we design a novel AI-based framework that automates cable connector mating by integrating force control with deep visuotactile learning. Our system optimizes search-and-insertion strategies using first-order optimization over a multimodal transformer architecture trained on visual, tactile, and proprioceptive data. Additionally, we design a novel automated data collection and optimization pipeline that minimizes the need for machine learning expertise. The framework optimizes robot programs that run natively on standard industrial controllers, permitting human experts to audit and certify them. Experimental validations on a center console assembly task demonstrate significant improvements in cycle times and robustness compared to conventional robot programming approaches.

      <title>Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce neural network architectures that combine physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the immersed boundary method (IBM) to solve fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Our approach features two distinct architectures: a Single-FSI network with a unified parameter space, and an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian network that maintains separate parameter spaces for fluid and structure domains. We study each architecture using standard Tanh and adaptive B-spline activation functions. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that the Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture performs significantly better. The adaptive B-spline activation further enhances accuracy by providing locality-aware representation near boundaries. While our methodology shows promising results in predicting the velocity field, pressure recovery remains challenging due to the absence of explicit force-coupling constraints in the current formulation. Our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific architectural design and adaptive activation functions for modeling FSI problems within the PINN framework.</description>
