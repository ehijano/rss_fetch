      <title>A new non-autonomous version of Hirota's discrete KdV equation and its discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hirota's discrete KdV (dKdV) equation is an integrable autonomous partial difference equation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that reduces to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in a continuum limit. In this paper, we introduce a new non-autonomous version of the dKdV equation. Furthermore, we show that the new equation is integrable and admits discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions described by $q$-Painlev\'e equations of $A_J^{(1)}$-surface types ($J=3,4,5,6$).</description>

      <title>Riccati-type pseudo-potential approach to quasi-integrability of deformed soliton theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper explores the Riccati-type pseudo-potential formulation applied to the quasi-integrable sine-Gordon, KdV, and NLS models. The proposed framework provides a unified methodology for analyzing quasi-integrability properties across various integrable systems, including deformations of the sine-Gordon, Bullough-Dodd, Toda, KdV, pKdV, NLS and SUSY sine-Gordon models. Key findings include the emergence of infinite towers of anomalous conservation laws within the Riccati-type approach and the identification of exact non-local conservation laws in the linear formulations of deformed models. As modified integrable models play a crucial role in diverse fields of non-linear physics-such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superconductivity, gravity models, optics, and soliton turbulence-these results may have far-reaching applications.</description>

      <title>Peakons and pseudo-peakons of higher order b-family equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the rich structure of peakon and pseudo-peakon solutions for a class of higher-order $b$-family equations, referred to as the $J$-th $b$-family ($J$-bF) equations. We propose several conjectures concerning the weak solutions of these equations, including a $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution, a $b$-independent peakon solution, and a $b$-dependent peakon solution. These conjectures are analytically verified for $J \leq 14$ and/or $J \leq 9$ using the computer algebra software MAPLE. The $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution is a 3rd-order pseudo-peakon for general arbitrary constants, with higher-order pseudo-peakons derived under specific parameter constraints. Additionally, we identify both $b$-independent and $b$-dependent peakon solutions, highlighting their distinct properties and the nuanced relationship between the parameters $b$ and $J$. The existence of these solutions underscores the rich dynamical structure of the $J$-bF equations and generalizes previous results for lower-order equations. Future research directions include higher-order generalizations, rigorous proofs of the conjectures, interactions between different types of peakons and pseudo-peakons, stability analysis, and potential physical applications. These advancements significantly contribute to the understanding of peakon systems and their broader implications in mathematics and physics.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of soliton gases for the defocusing NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive Nonlinear Dispersion Relations (NDR) for the defocusing NLS (dark) soliton gas using the idea of thermodynamic limit of quasimomentum and quasienergy differentials on the underlying family of Riemann surfaces. It turns out that the obtained NDR are closely connected with the recently studied NDR for circular soliton gas for the focusing NLS. We find solutions for the kinetic equation for the defocusing NLS soliton condensate, which is defined by the endpoints of the spectral support $\Gamma$ for the NDR. It turns out that, similarly to KdV soliton condensates (\cite{CERT}), the evolution of these endpoints is governed by the defocusing NLS-Whitham equations (\cite{Kodama}). We also study the Riemann problem for step initial data and the kurtosis of genus zero and one defNLS condensates, where we proved that the kurtosis of genus one condensate can not exceed 3/2, whereas for genus zero condensate the kurtosis is always 1.</description>
