      <title>On Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer in certain generic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four.</description>

      <title>Dowker's theorem for higher-order relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a relation $R \subseteq I \times J$ between two sets, Dowker's Theorem (1952) states that the homology groups of two associated simplicial complexes, now known as Dowker complexes, are isomorphic. In its modern form, the full result asserts a functorial homotopy equivalence between the two Dowker complexes. What can be said about relations defined on three or more sets? We present a simple generalization to multiway relations of the form $R \subseteq I_1 \times I_2 \times \cdots \times I_m$. The theorem asserts functorial homotopy equivalences between $m$ multiway Dowker complexes and a variant of the rectangle complex of Brun and Salbu from their recent short proof of Dowker's Theorem. Our proof uses Smale's homotopy mapping theorem and factors through a cellular Dowker lemma that expresses the main idea in more general form. To make the geometry more transparent, we work with a class of spaces called prod-complexes then transfer the results to simplicial complexes through a simplexification process. We conclude with a detailed study of ternary relations, identifying seven functorially defined homotopy types and twelve natural transformations between them.</description>

      <title>Tetraplectic structures compatible with local quaternionic toric actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quaternionic analogue of toric geometry by developing the theory of local $Q^n := Sp(1)^n$-actions on 4n-dimensional manifolds, modeled on the regular representation. We identify obstructions that measure the failure of local properties to globalize and define two invariants: a combinatorial invariant called the characteristic pair and a cohomological invariant called the Euler class, which together classify local quaternionic torus actions up to homeomorphism. We also study tetraplectic structures in quaternionic toric geometry by introducing locally generalized Lagrangian-type toric fibrations and show that such fibrations are locally modeled on $\mathbb{R}^n\times Q^n$ using a quaternionic version of the Arnold-Liouville theorem. In the last part, we show that orbit spaces of these actions acquire the structure of quaternionic integral affine manifolds with corners and Lagrangian overlaps, and we classify such spaces by establishing a quaternionic Delzant-type theorem.</description>

      <title>Colimits in the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-topoi and \'etale morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative proof of Lurie's result that the wide subcategory of the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-topoi spanned by the \'etale morphisms is closed under small colimits. Our proof is based on a new characterization of \'etale morphisms of $\infty$-topoi in relation to univalent families and does not rely on a larger universe. During the proof, we also give an elementary construction of univalent completion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of doubling and r-tupling for simplicial complexes, a notion reminiscent to that of matching complexes in graph theory. We prove a connectivity result for such complexes and relate r-tupling to stabilizing r times faster in homological stability.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and cohomological dimension of surface braid groups and poly-surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the asymptotic dimension of all surface braid groups, including those associated to non-orientable and infinite-type surfaces, as well as for torsion-free surface groups that are poly-finitely generated. Moreover, we show that in these two classes of groups, the virtual cohomological dimension and the asymptotic dimension coincide. For poly-finitely generated surface groups and braid groups of finite-type surfaces, these results are based on showing that they are virtual duality groups in the sense of Bieri and Eckmann and, for braid groups of infinite-type surfaces the argument relies on the observation that these groups are countable and normally poly-free.</description>

      <title>Log Geometric Models for Little Disks Operads in Even Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a model for the (non-unital) S^1-framed little 2d-dimensional disks operad for any positive integer d using logarithmic geometry. We also show that the unframed little 2d-dimensional disks operad has a model which can be constructed using log schemes with virtual morphisms.</description>

      <title>The affirmative answer to Singer's conjecture on the algebraic transfer of rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, the structure of the mod-2 cohomology of the Steenrod ring $\mathscr A$ has become a major subject of study in the field of Algebraic Topology. One of the earliest attempts to study this cohomology through the use of modular representations of the general linear groups was the groundbreaking work [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523] by W.M. Singer. In that work, Singer introduced a homomorphism, commonly referred to as the "algebraic transfer," which maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of the general linear group to the mod-2 cohomology group of the ring $\mathscr A.$ Singer's conjecture, in particular, which states that the algebraic transfer is a monomorphism for all homological degrees, remains a highly significant and unresolved problem in Algebraic Topology. In this research, we take a major stride toward resolving the Singer conjecture by establishing its truth for the homological degree four.</description>
