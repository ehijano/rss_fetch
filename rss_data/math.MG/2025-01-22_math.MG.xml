      <title>On lattice illumination of smooth convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The illumination conjecture is a classical open problem in convex and discrete geometry, asserting that every compact convex body~$K$ in $\mathbb R^n$ can be illuminated by a set of no more than $2^n$ points. If $K$ has smooth boundary, it is known that $n+1$ points are necessary and sufficient. We consider an effective variant of the illumination problem for bodies with smooth boundary, where the illuminating set is restricted to points of a lattice and prove the existence of such a set close to $K$ with an explicit bound on the maximal distance. We produce improved bounds on this distance for certain classes of lattices, exhibiting additional symmetry or near-orthogonality properties. Our approach is based on the geometry of numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Random Partial Sphere Coverings in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $N$ geodesic caps on the normalized unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and whose total surface area sums to one, what is the maximal surface area their union can cover? We show that when these caps have equal surface area, as both the dimension $d$ and the number of caps $N$ tend to infinity, the maximum proportion covered approaches $1 - e^{-1} \approx 0.632$. Furthermore, this maximum is achieved by a random partial sphere covering. Our result refines a classical estimate for the covering density of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by Erd\H{o}s, Few, and Rogers (Mathematika, 11(2):171--184, 1964).</description>

      <title>On the concept of center for geometric objects and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we review the concept of center of a geometric object as an equivariant map, unifying and generalizing different approaches followed by authors such as C. Kimberling or A. Edmonds. We provide examples to illustrate that this general approach encompasses many interesting spaces of geometric objects arising from different settings. Additionally, we discuss two results that characterize centers for some particular spaces of geometric objects, and we pose five open questions related to the generalization of these characterizations to other spaces. Finally, we conclude this article by briefly discussing other central objects and their relation to this concept of center.</description>

      <title>Poncelet pairs of a circle and parabolas from a confocal family and Painlev\'e VI equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pairs of conics $(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{P})$, called \textit{$n$-Poncelet pairs}, such that an $n$-gon, called an \textit{$n$-Poncelet polygon}, can be inscribed into $\mathcal{D}$ and circumscribed about $\mathcal{P}$. Here $\mathcal{D}$ is a circle and $\mathcal{P}$ is a parabola from a confocal pencil $\mathcal{F}$ with the focus $F$. We prove that the circle contains $F$ if and only if every parabola $\mathcal{P}\in\mathcal{F}$ forms a $3$-Poncelet pair with the circle. We prove that the center of $\mathcal{D}$ coincides with $F$ if and only if every parabola $\mathcal{P}\in \mathcal{F}$ forms a $4$-Poncelet pair with the circle. We refer to such property, observed for $n=3$ and $n=4$, as \textit{$n$-isoperiodicity}. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$ is not $n$-isoperiodic with any circle $\mathcal{D}$ for $n$ different from $3$ and $4$. Using isoperiodicity, we construct explicit algebraic solutions to Painlev\'e VI equations.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Aldous, Blanc and Curien asked which distributions can be expressed as the distance between two independent random variables on some separable measured metric space. We show that every nonnegative discrete distribution whose support contains $0$ arises in this way, as well as a class of finitely supported distributions with density.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles supported by small chords and compatible with natural real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously proposed a study of arrangements of small circles which also surround regions in the plane realized as the images of natural real algebraic maps yielding Morse-Bott functions by projections. Among studies of arrangements, families of smooth regular submanifolds in smooth manifolds, this study is fundamental, explicit, and new, surprisingly.
  We have obtained a complete list of local changes of the graphs the regions naturally collapse to in adding a (generic) small circle to an existing arrangement of the proposed class. Here, we propose a similar and essentially different class of arrangements of circles. The present study also yields real algebraic maps and nice real algebraic functions similarly and we present a similar study.
  We are interested in topological properties and combinatorics among such arrangements and regions and applications to constructing such real algebraic maps and manifolds explicitly and understanding their global structures.</description>

      <title>Simplices with fixed volumes of codimension 2 faces in a continuous deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $n$-dimensional simplex in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\ge 4$, it is asked that if a continuous deformation preserves the volumes of all the codimension 2 faces, then is it necessarily a \emph{rigid} motion. While the question remains open and the general belief is that the answer is affirmative, for all $n\ge 4$, we provide counterexamples to a variant of the question where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is replaced by a pseudo-Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{p,n-p}$ for some unspecified $p\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Traces of Newton-Sobolev functions on the visible boundary of domains in doubling metric measure spaces supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of whether a domain with uniformly thick boundary at all locations and at all scales has a large portion of its boundary visible from the interior; here, "visibility" indicates the existence of John curves connecting the interior point to the points on the "visible boundary". In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer in the setting of a doubling metric measure space supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, thus extending the results of [20,2,9] to non-Ahlfors regular spaces. We show that $t$-codimensional thickness of the boundary for $0&lt;t&lt;p$ implies $p$-codimensional thickness of the visible boundary. For such domains we prove that traces of Sobolev functions on the domain belong to the Besov class of the visible boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we prove a version of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss flattening Lemma for point sets taking values in discrete subgroups. More precisely, given $d,\lambda_0,N_0\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon\in \left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ suitably chosen, we show there exists a natural number $k=k(d,\epsilon)=O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\log d\right)$, such that for every sufficiently large scaling factor $\lambda\in\mathbb{N}$ and any point set $\mathcal{D}\subset\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\mathbb{Z}^d\cap B(0,\lambda N_0)$ with cardinality $d$, there exists an embedding $F:\mathcal{D}\to\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\mathbb{Z}^k$, with distortion at most $\left(1+\epsilon+\frac{\epsilon}{\lambda\lambda_0}\right)$.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric structure of quantum SU(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two parameter family of Dirac operators on quantum SU(2) and analyse their properties from the point of view of non-commutative metric geometry. It is shown that these Dirac operators give rise to compact quantum metric structures, and that the corresponding two parameter family of compact quantum metric spaces varies continuously in Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This continuity result includes the classical case where we recover the round 3-sphere up to a global scaling factor on the metric. Our main technical tool is a quantum SU(2) analogue of the Berezin transform, together with its associated fuzzy approximations, the analysis of which also leads to a systematic way of approximating Lipschitz operators by means of polynomial expressions in the generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14985v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subtracting a critical rank-one approximation from a matrix always results in a matrix with a lower rank. This is not true for tensors in general. Motivated by this, we ask the question: what is the closure of the set of those tensors for which subtracting some of its critical rank-one approximation from it and repeating the process we will eventually get to zero? In this article, we show how to construct this variety of tensors and we show how this is connected to the bottleneck points of the variety of rank-one tensors (and in general to the singular locus of the hyperdeterminant), and how this variety can be equal to and in some cases be more than (weakly) orthogonally decomposable tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a proper geodesically complete CAT(-1) space equipped with a discrete non-elementary action, and a bounded continuous potential with the Bowen property, we construct weighted quasi-conformal Patterson densities and use them to build a Gibbs measure on the space of geodesic lines. Our construction yields a Gibbs measure with local product structure for any potential in this class, which includes bounded H\"older continuous potentials. Furthermore, if the Gibbs measure is finite, then we prove that it is the unique equilibrium state. In contrast to previous results in this direction, we do not require any condition that the potential must take the same value on two geodesic lines which share a common segment.</description>

      <title>Contraction properties and differentiability of $p$-energy forms with applications to nonlinear potential theory on self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new contraction property, which we call the generalized $p$-contraction property, for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as $p$-Clarkson's inequality, the strong subadditivity and the Markov property in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying $p$-Clarkson's inequality is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms on fractals constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking the generalized $p$-contraction property into consideration, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties of $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of self-similar $p$-energy forms on self-similar sets are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for $p$-harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of any generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet and the $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ restriction estimates from the Fourier spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stein--Tomas restriction theorem is an important result in Fourier restriction theory. It gives a range of $q$ for which $L^q\to L^2$ restriction estimates hold for a given measure, in terms of the Fourier and Frostman dimensions of the measure. We generalise this result by using the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Sobolev dimensions for measures. This gives us a continuum of Stein--Tomas type estimates, and optimising over this continuum gives a new $L^q\to L^2$ restriction theorem which often outperforms the Stein--Tomas result. We also provide results in the other direction by giving a range of $q$ in terms of the Fourier spectrum for which $L^q\to L^2$ restriction estimates fail, generalising an observation of Hambrook and {\L}aba. We illustrate our results with several examples, including the surface measure on the cone, the moment curve, and several fractal measures.</description>
