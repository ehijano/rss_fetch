      <title>Gauging Flavor Symmetries of the Standard Model: from Dark Energy to Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry from Higher Dimensions in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics has global Family flavor symmetries corresponding to the 3 families in the Standard Model. It has been shown that the breaking of these symmetries at low energy produces Dark Energy which is the dominant component of the energy density of the Universe. It has also been shown that this model of Dark Energy not only explains the accelerated expansion of the universe but has additional observational consequences and makes verifiable predictions. This model allows a space-time dependent Dark Energy as indicated by recent observations. Further, the collapse of space dependent Dark Energy configurations leads to the formation of Dark Energy Black Holes resulting in verifiable predictions. We examine the implications of these symmetries at high energies and in the Early Universe. We consider what might happen if these global symmetries get gauged and that the global symmetries today are just a consequence of the gauge fields acquiring a constant vacuum expectation value below some energy scale v. Since, we have not yet seen signatures of such gauge fields at any of our particle accelerators, this would imply that v is greater than the electroweak scale. In the early Universe, when these gauge fields would be dynamical, the Higgs would not yet have acquired a non-zero vacuum expectation value and all Standard Model particles would be massless. The gauging of these global symmetries is desirable from a high energy and quantum gravity perspective. The chiral dynamics has a natural interpretation in terms of D Branes and our 4-dimensional Universe embedded in higher dimensions. Anomaly cancellation in this scenario results from the sum of the cubic terms vanishing. Finally, the analysis in this article can provide an explanation for one of the long standing mysteries of the natural world: the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in our Universe.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective theory of scalar and vector diquarks revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the same satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes (f-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra and wave functions of toponia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we solve the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with a linear plus Coulomb potential and conduct a meticulous study of the mass spectrum and wave function of toponium. Our investigation reveals that, owing to the exceedingly heavy mass of the top quark, the mass splitting between singlet and triplet states, as well as within the triplet states, is negligible. Consequently, relativistic corrections can be safely disregarded in the study of toponium. As such, we present the nonrelativistic wave functions for $S$-wave, $P$-wave, and $D$-wave toponia and study the decays $\eta_t\to \gamma\gamma$, $\eta_t\to gg$, and $\Theta\to \ell^+\ell^-$.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed P-wave tetraquark resonant states in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive P-wave four-body dynamical calculations of the fully charmed tetraquark systems within the quark potential model. We apply the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, incorporating both dimeson and diquark-antidiquark spatial configurations. The matrix elements of P-wave states are calculated analytically using the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the complex scaling method, we obtain several fully charmed P-wave resonant states with compact tetraquark configuration in the mass region of $(7.0,7.2)$ GeV, including states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{-+}$. However, we find no resonant states with the mass $M&lt;7$ GeV and width $\Gamma&lt;200$ MeV. Combining the present investigation with our previous results on S-wave fully charmed tetraquark systems, candidates for the experimental states $X(6400)$ and $X(6600)$ are still absent in the quark model.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gluon contribution to the angular momentum distribution of a dressed quark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the contribution of the gluonic component of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) to the angular momentum density in various decompositions. We use the light-front Hamiltonian technique, and a two-component formalism in light-front gauge, where the constrained degrees of freedom are eliminated. Instead of a nucleon, we consider a simple composite spin-$1/2$ state, namely a quark dressed with a gluon. We present two dimensional light-front distributions in transverse impact parameter space, and compare the different angular momentum decompositions at the density level. Incorporating also the contribution coming from the quark part of the EMT, we verify the spin sum rule for such a state.</description>

      <title>Hadron production in the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged current weak interaction can distinguish quark flavors, it provides a valid method to determine (transverse momentum dependent) parton distribution functions in high energy reactions by utilizing tagged hadrons. In this paper, we calculate the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei. Semi-inclusive means that a spin-1 hadron is also measured in addition to the scattered charged lepton. The target nucleus has the same number of neutrons and protons and is assumed as unpolarized. According to calculations, we find that only chiral-even terms survive and chiral-odd terms vanish in the differential cross section for this charged current deeply inelastic (anti-)neutrino nucleus scattering process. Furthermore, we introduce a universal measurable quantity, the yield asymmetry of the produced hadron $A^h$, to determine the muclear transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions. Numerical estimates show that the yield asymmetry is independent of the type of target nucleus if it has the same number of neutrons and protons. Numerical estimates also show that the isospin symmetry works very successfully in the $N=Z$ nuclei and sea quark distribution functions and disfavored fragmentation functions have significant influence on measurable quantities.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions of the kaon and pion within the nonlocal chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we explore the properties of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for the kaon and pion within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model (NL$\chi$QM). Valence quark GPDs of the kaon and pion are analyzed with respect to their momentum fraction $x$ and skewness $\xi$ dependencies in the DGLAP and ERBL regions. We observe that the asymmetry of the current quark masses in kaon results in a significant distortion of the quark GPDs in kaon near $\xi=1$, compared to the case of the pion. The quark GPDs of the kaon and pion are evolved to $\mu^2 = 4$ GeV$^2$ and 100 GeV$^2$ by the QCD evolution equation at one-loop order using the \texttt{APFEL++} package. We find that the produced sea quarks and gluons are largely suppressed as $\xi$ becomes nonzero, predominantly confined within the ERBL region. We subsequently examine the polynomiality of the GPDs and numerically obtain the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the kaon and pion. For the kaon, gravitational form factor ratios $A_{\bar s/K^+}(0)/A_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.26$ and $D_{\bar s/K^+}(0)/D_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.10$ are reported and compared with results from other effective models.</description>

      <title>Roles of $f_{0}(500)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ in the $D_{(s)}^{+}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent measurements of the $D_{s}^{+}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $D^{+}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays by the LHCb Collaboration, we study these two decay processes by considering the final state interaction formalism. Taking into account the external and internal $W$-emission dominant mechanisms at the quark level, our model can naturally explain why the $D_{s}^{+}$ decay only has a contribution from the $f_{0}(980)$ resonance, while the $D^{+}$ decay has contributions from both the $f_{0}(500)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ states. The magnitudes and phases of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ for $S$-wave amplitudes in our model are in agreement with the experimental measurements. These results support the interpretations of $f_{0}(500)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ as the $\pi\pi$ and $K\bar{K}$ resonances, respectively, where they are dynamically generated from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar meson interactions within the chiral unitary approach.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the distribution of fireballs produced in heavy-ion collisions in the net-baryon number and argue that neither the Free-Quark Model (FQM) nor the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model can provide a comprehensive explanation of the distribution observed at the LHC. The concept of net-baryon number freezeout temperature is suggested and the role of sea quarks as a possible source of net-baryon number fluctuations is emphasized.</description>

      <title>GeV ALP from TeV Vector-like leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model where a GeV axion-like-particle (ALP) is predicted in a large portion of the parameter space due to the presence of explicit Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking terms in an exotic leptonic sector. The latter provides a solution to the muon $g-2$ anomaly, within the framework of the Linear Seesaw neutrino mechanism. The spectrum is extended by a complex scalar singlet only transforming under the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which generates the ALP. Its couplings with fermions can continuously span over many orders of magnitude, which constitutes a specific feature of this model in contrast to generic ultraviolet constructions. Interestingly, these couplings are suppressed by the ALP characteristic scale that can be as low as the TeV scale, which represents a novel feature of the model and opens up to several phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the possible existence of a strangeness $S=-3$, isospin $I=1$ pentaquark state $P_{sss}$ generated dynamically from the $\bar{K}\Xi$ interaction. We employ a unitarized scheme in coupled channels based on the chiral Lagrangian expanded up to next-to-leading order (NLO), and show that the inclusion of the NLO terms is crucial to provide the necessary attraction that favors the existence of such triply strange pentaquark. The $\bar{K}\Xi$ femtoscopic correlation functions are calculated as example of a possible experimental measurement in which a direct signal of the $P_{sss}$ state could be observed.</description>

      <title>Test RG Running of the Leptonic Dirac CP Phase with Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the possibility of using the near detector at reactor neutrino experiments to probe the renormalization group (RG) running effect on the leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_D$. Although the reactor neutrino oscillation cannot directly measure $\delta_D$, it can probe the deviation $\Delta \delta \equiv \delta_D(Q^2_d) - \delta_D(Q^2_p)$ caused by the RG running. Being a key element, the mismatched momentum transfers at neutrino production ($Q^2_p$) and detection ($Q^2_d$) processes can differ by two orders. We illustrate this concept with the upcoming JUNO-TAO experiment and obtain the projected sensitivity to the CP RG running beta function $\beta_\delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic hadrons beyond the conventional quark model have been discovered in the past two decades. Investigations of these states can lead to deep understanding of nonperturbative dynamics of the strong interaction. In this concise review, we focus on the productions of exotic hadrons in $pp$, $p\bar p$, and nuclear collisions. Experimental observations of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as prototypes of hadronic molecules, in heavy ion collisions will also be briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Zeeman effect in oscillations of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields. Some of them (soft-gamma repeaters, SGRs) demonstrate gigantic flares which nature is still unclear. At decay phase of such flares one often observes quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) which are treated as stellar oscillations triggered by the flares. We study, for the first time, magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars possessing toroidal magnetic fields confined in the stellar crust, without imposing axial symmetry of perturbations. We show that the Zeeman effect makes the oscillation spectrum much richer than for axially symmetric oscillations. The main properties of theoretical QPO spectra are discussed as well as their potential to interpret observations and explore magnetar physics.</description>

      <title>Study of the exotic three-body $N D^* \bar{K}^*$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the $N D^* \bar{K}^*$ system in the framework of the Fixed Center Approximation to the Faddeev equations, taking the exotic $D^* \bar{K}^* $ system as the cluster and allowing the N to interact with the components of the cluster. Previous studies have determined the existence of three states of spin $0,1,2$ for the $D^* \bar{K}^* $ system, the one of spin $0$ associated to the $X_0(2900)$ state observed by the LHCb collaboration. From this perspective, we find five states with total spin $1/2,3/2,5/2$, with bindings from $10$ to $30$ MeV and widths below $60$ MeV, which could be well identified. We also discuss the decay channels of these states that should help in future experimental searches of these states.</description>

      <title>CP violation observables in baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of baryon physics is on the horizon with the accumulation of increasing data by collaborations such as LHCb, Belle II, and BESIII. Despite the wealth of data, one of the critical issues in flavor physics, namely CP violation in baryon decays, still awaits experimental confirmation. It is evident that the development of formulas and phenomenological analyses will play a pivotal role in advancing theoretical investigations and experimental measurements in this domain. In this work, we discuss the fundamental definitions and properties of polarization, asymmetry parameters and their associated CP violating observables that may arise in baryon decays. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of b-baryon quasi-two and -three body decays based on angular distributions. We highlight the significance of CP asymmetries defined by spin and momentum correlations, as non-trivial spin distributions are expected in baryon decays due to their non-zero polarization in productions and decays. Of particular importance is a complementary relation can be establised for two different types of observables, that are $\mathcal{T}$-even and -odd CP asymmetries respectively. The complementarity indicates that one observable exhibits the sine dependence on strong phase $\Delta\delta$, while another exhibits as cosine. This gives us an distinctive opportunity to avoid the potential large suppression to CP asymmetries from small phase $\Delta\delta$. Two points (\textbf{i}) the exact proof of strong phase dependence behaviour, and (\textbf{ii}) the criterion for complementary observables are clarified. Based on these arguments from theoretical aside, some brief discussions and suggestions on experimental measurements are offered in the final discussions. Lastly, we present a pedagogical introduction to angular distribution techniques based on helicity descriptions for both two and three body decays.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Electromagnetic radiation with an angular frequency equal to half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Implications on CP violation of charmless three body decays of bottom baryon from the U-spin analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent LHCb measurements of CP violation in $\Lambda_b$ three-body decays, we conduct an analysis of CP asymmetry in three-body decays of bottom baryons utilizing U-spin symmetry. We first develop a convenient representation that facilitates the incorporation of U-spin symmetry into our analysis. By integrating weak and strong phases into the derived amplitude, we obtain the CP asymmetry and establish relationships between CP asymmetries in U-spin related decay channels. With the help of experimental measurements, we provide numerical predictions for the CP asymmetries for other decay channels, particularly $\Lambda_b \to \Sigma^0 K^+ K^-$, $\Xi^0_b \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\Lambda_b \to \Sigma^0 K^+ \pi^-$, and $\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma K^- \pi^+$. Furthermore, we provide a quantity that can be used as a null test of standard model and deviations from 0 will reflect the possible new physics. These results are valuable for CPV measurements in baryon decays, and can be tested in future experiments.</description>

The approaches considered range from the color glass condensate where correlations are encoded in the initial state, to hydrodynamic frameworks, where a strong final state response to the initial geometry of the collision is the key ingredient to generate momentum-space correlations.</description>

      <title>A tale of Bethe logarithms: leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}$ and Lamb shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare annihilation decays of $P$-wave spin-triplet quarkonia into lepton pair have to proceed via two-photon intermediate state, which are plagued with the infrared divergence symptom. We recognize that the physical root of the IR divergence and its remedy is the same as the Lamb shift in QED. In this work we provide a complete solution to this IR problem by including the effect of the higher Fock component of the $\chi_{cJ}$ state, {\it viz.}, the $c\bar{c}(^3S_1^{(1)})$ pair accompanied with a very long wavelength photon. Adding the contributions from the leading and next-to-leading order Fock components together, we arrive at the IR finite and factorization scale independent predictions for leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$. The Bethe logarithms associated with these exclusive reactions are found to have rather different traits from those associated with Lamb shift. We present numerical predictions by employing several influential quark potential models. The predicted leptonic widths of $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$ are sizable and the observation prospect for $e^+e^-\to \chi_{cJ}(1P,2P)$ at BESIII looks bright. The future observation of $e^+e^-\to X(3872)$ will shed important light on the $c\bar{c}$ content of the $X(3872)$ meson.</description>

      <title>Modular invariant inflation, reheating and leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor problem, inflation, post-inflationary reheating, and baryogenesis. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We find that the same couplings responsible for reheating also contribute to generating part of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scale Variations: Perturbative Theory Uncertainties from Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to estimate the uncertainty due to missing higher orders in perturbative predictions (the perturbative "theory uncertainty"), which overcomes many inherent limitations of the currently prevalent methods based on varying unphysical renormalization scales. In our approach, the true underlying sources of the theory uncertainty, namely the missing higher-order terms, are identified and parameterized in terms of mutually independent theory nuisance parameters (TNPs). The TNPs are true parameters of the calculation, i.e., they have a well-defined true value that is not or only imprecisely known. This approach affords the theory uncertainty all benefits of a truly parametric uncertainty: It provides correct correlations and allows for consistent error propagation and combination. Furthermore, the TNPs can be profiled in fits, allowing the data to reduce the theory uncertainties. On the theory side, it allows maximally exploiting all available higher-order information to reduce the theory uncertainty, such as partial higher-order results or any nontrivial knowledge of the higher-order or all-order structure. We first discuss the method in general as it can be applied across the board of perturbative calculations. As a concrete application, we then discuss the resummed transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum in Drell-Yan production, and how TNP-based uncertainties can correctly capture the correlations across the $q_T$ spectrum and between $Z$ and $W$ production. This application is the basis of the theory model enabling the recent precise measurement of the $W$-boson mass by the CMS experiment. In a forthcoming paper, we use it to study the theory uncertainties in extracting the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ from the $Z$ $q_T$ spectrum.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of the Real Higgs Triplet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the Standard Model extended by a $Y=0$ real Higgs triplet, the $\Delta$SM. It contains a $CP$-even neutral Higgs ($\Delta^0$) and two charged Higgs bosons ($\Delta^\pm$), which are quasi-degenerate in mass. We first study the theoretical constraints from vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity and then calculate the Higgs decays, including the loop-induced modes such as di-photons ($\gamma\gamma$) and $Z\gamma$. In the limit of a small mixing between the SM Higgs and $\Delta^0$, the latter decays dominantly to $WW$ and can have a sizable branching ratio to di-photon. The model predicts a positive definite shift in the $W$ mass, which agrees with the current global electroweak fit. At the Large Hadron Collider, it leads to a $(i)$ stau-like signature from $pp\to \Delta^+\Delta^-\to \tau^+\tau^-\nu\bar\nu$, $(ii)$ multi-lepton final states from $pp\to \gamma^*\to \Delta^+\Delta^-\to W^+W^-ZZ$ and $pp\to W^{*} \to \Delta^\pm\Delta^0\to W^\pm Z W^+W^-$ as well as $(iii)$ associated di-photon production from $pp\to W^{*} \to \Delta^\pm(\Delta^0\to\gamma\gamma)$. Concerning $(i)$, the reinterpretation of the recent supersymmetric tau partner search by ATLAS and CMS excludes $m_{\Delta^\pm}&lt;110$ GeV at 95% CL. From $(ii)$, some of the signal regions of multi-lepton searches lead to bounds close to the predicted cross-section, but electroweak scale masses are still allowed. For $(iii)$, the recast of the associated di-photon searches by ATLAS and a combined log-likelihood fit of signal and background to data find that out of the 25 signal regions, 10 provide relevant limits on Br$(\Delta^0\to\gamma\gamma)$ at the per cent level. Interestingly, 6 signal regions show excesses at around 152 GeV, leading to a preference for a non-zero di-photon branching ratio of about 0.7% with the corresponding significance amounting to about $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Neutron emission from the photon-induced reactions in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultraperipheral collisions are the source of various interesting phenomena based on photon-induced reactions. We calculate cross sections for single and any number of n, p, $\alpha$, $\gamma$-rays in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision for LHC energies.
  We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which only part of photon energy $E_\gamma$ is changed into the excitation energy of the nucleus ($E_{exc} \neq E_{\gamma}$) and compare its results with outcomes of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. The role of high photon energies for small neutron multiplicities is discussed. Emission of a small number of neutrons at high photon energies seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section of four- and five-neutron emission cross sections from first principles is rather demanding. The estimated emission of charged particles such as protons, deuterons and $\alpha$ is shortly discussed and confronted with very recent ALICE data, obtained with the proton Zero Degree Calorimeter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of ultralight dark matter helps constrain the lower bound on minimally coupled dark matter models. The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales similar to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay and gravitational redshift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations. Finally, we provide a comparison with existing pulsar observation sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Space-borne Interferometers to Detect Thousands of Memory Signals Emitted by Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational memory effect manifests the nonlinearity of the gravitation, reflects the degenerate gravitational vacua, and indicates the types of the asymptotic symmetries. However, by the received wisdom, it would be challenging to detect it. In this Letter, we envisioned employing the space-borne interferometer, especially DECIGO, to detect memory signals generated by the stellar-mass binary black hole (BBHs) systems, the conventional targets of the ground-based detectors. We estimated that during its 5 years' observation, DECIGO could detect nearly 2,258 loud enough memory signals. Among them, 102 have signal-to-noise ratios greater than 8. Our prediction was obtained with the BBH population model constrained by the recent gravitational wave observations in GWTC-3. The Power Law + Peak mass model and the DEFAULT spin model were employed, and the merger rate was chosen to be proportional to the Madau-Dickinson formation rate. In the analysis, the impact of the orbital eccentricity was also considered. The high rate is due to the sufficiently strong memory signal right at the bandwidth of DECIGO, and also because of the humongous number of the surely existing stellar-mass BBHs. The substantial, and yet conservative, number of detections enables to leverage statistical approaches to harness the memory effect for fundamental physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>High density symmetry energy: A key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scale factor Duality Symmetry in Symmetric Teleparallel Scalar-tensor FLRW Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry for the dilaton field in scalar-tensor theory and its extension in teleparallelism. Within the framework of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor theory, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker metric cosmology. For the three possible connections, we write the corresponding point-like Lagrangians for the gravitational field equations, and we construct discrete transformations which generalize the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry. The discrete transformations depend on the parameter which defines the coupling between the scalar field and the nonmetricity scalar. The Gasperini-Veneziano duality symmetry is recovered for a specific limit of this free parameter. Furthermore, we derive the conservation laws for the classical field equations for these models, and we present the origin of the discrete transformations. Finally, we discuss the integrability properties of the model, and exact solutions are determined.</description>

      <title>Progress on the spectroscopy of an Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to matter in multiple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report progress on our lattice calculations for the mass spectra of low-lying composite states in the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to two and three flavors of Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental and the two-index antisymmetric representations, respectively. This theory provides an ultraviolet completion to the composite Higgs model with Goldstone modes in the SU(4)/Sp(4) coset and with partial compositeness for generating the top-quark mass. We measure the meson and chimera baryon masses. These masses are crucial for constructing the composite Higgs model. In particular, the chimera baryon masses are important inputs for implementing top partial compositeness. We employ Wilson fermions and the Wilson plaquette action in our simulations. Techniques such as APE and Wuppertal smearing, as well as the procedure of generalised eigenvalue problem, are implemented in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly contributions to baryon masses from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present lattice calculations of the masses of baryons containing the light, strange and charm quarks and their decompositions into sigma terms and trace anomaly. These results are obtained from 2+1 flavor QCD ensembles at 5 lattice spacings $a\in[0.05,0.11]$ fm, 4 spatial sizes $L\in[2.5, 5.1]$ fm, 7 pion masses $m_{\pi}\in[135,350]$ MeV, and several values of the strange quark mass. The continuum extrapolated masses of all the baryons agree with experiments at the 1\% level. We found that the glue part of the trace anomaly contributes about the same amount to the masses -- $\sim$ 0.8 - 0.95 GeV for the spin 1/2 baryons and $\sim$ 0.95 - 1.1 GeV for the spin 3/2 baryons -- given $\gamma_m\sim$ 0.3, and the sigma terms from the light, strange, and charm quarks are enhanced by factors of about 5, 2, and 1.3, respectively, compared to the renormalized quark mass themselves at \(\overline{\mathrm{MS}}\) 2 GeV.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation dominated period (RD), and the matter dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the $R^2$ inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, taking into account the violations of slow roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar across both methods, regardless of the potential under consideration. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the RD and MD phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation: summation of non-local self-energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the 2PI effective action formalism, we study false vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation of the path integral. We derive a coupled system of equations for the bounce and the propagator, and we compute a semi-analytic expression for the self-energy of a real scalar field with cubic and quartic interactions from the 2PI effective action truncated at two loops and without further approximations. Deriving numerical results, we can show that the Hartree approximation, where non-local contributions to the self-energy are neglected, is generally not justified. We find significant corrections to the negative eigenvalue and conclude that the summation of quantum corrections can have dramatic effects on the evaluation of the nucleation rate.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled PT-Symmetric Models in Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum field theories are a promising tool to study open quantum systems. These theories preserve unitarity if PT-symmetry is respected, and in that case an equivalent Hermitian description exists via the so-called Dyson map. Generically, PT-symmetric non-Hermitian theories can also feature phases where PT-symmetry is broken and unitarity is lost. We review the construction of holographic duals to strongly coupled PT-symmetric quantum field theories and the study of their phase diagram. We next focus on spacetime-dependent non-Hermitian couplings: non-Hermitian quenches and lattices. They violate the null energy condition in the gravity dual. The lattices realize phases supporting an imaginary current that breaks PT-symmetry spontaneously. Remarkably, these non-Hermitian lattices flow to a PT-symmetric fixed point in the IR.</description>

      <title>Preheating Axions in String Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain inflationary models can feature periods of preheating - an era preceding reheating during which parametric resonance triggers an exponential production of bosons. This non-perturbative process can have significant impact on the history of our universe, with consequences ranging from altered reheating channels to overproduction of dark radiation to overclosure. In this work, we study parametric resonance production of axions in string models of inflation. We find that the kinetic couplings and moduli-dependent axion masses give rise to generalizations of the Mathieu equation. We study these generalizations and determine the strength of parametric resonance created by such couplings. We then apply this technology to fibre inflation models in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. We find that heavy axions can be copiously produced and avoidance of overclosure results in constraints on the typical fibre inflation parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan anomaly using holography, finding that the $U(1)$ axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We also compute the thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term, revealing its characteristic $T^2$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Matter Signals in Timing Spectra at Neutrino Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.09386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity to dark matter signals at neutrino experiments is fundamentally challenged by the neutrino rates, as they leave similar signatures in their detectors. As a way to improve the signal sensitivity, we investigate a dark matter search strategy which utilizes the timing and energy spectra to discriminate dark matter from neutrino signals at low-energy, pulsed-beam neutrino experiments. This strategy was proposed in our companion paper arXiv:1906.10745, which we apply to potential searches at COHERENT, JSNS$^2$, and CCM. These experiments are not only sources of neutrinos but also high intensity sources of photons. The dark matter candidate of interest comes from the relatively prompt decay of a dark sector gauge boson which may replace a Standard-Model photon, so the delayed neutrino events can be suppressed by keeping prompt events only. Furthermore, prompt neutrino events can be rejected by a cut in recoil energy spectra, as their incoming energy is relatively small and bounded from above while dark matter may deposit a sizable energy beyond it. We apply the search strategy of imposing a combination of energy and timing cuts to the existing CsI data of the COHERENT experiment as a concrete example, and report a mild excess beyond known backgrounds. We then investigate the expected sensitivity reaches to dark matter signals in our benchmark experiments.</description>

      <title>CPT-Odd effects on the electromagnetic properties of charged leptons in the Standard Model Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of the CPT-Odd electroweak gauge sector of the Standard Model Extension on the electromagnetic properties of charged leptons is studied. This gauge sector is characterized by the $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$ Lorentz violation (LV) coefficients, which have positive mass dimension because they are associated with a $U_Y(1)$-invariant and with an $SU_L(2)$-invariant dimension-three operators, respectively. We present a comprehensive study on the impact of this sector on the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) and the electric dipole moment (EDM) of charged leptons, up to second order in these LV coefficients, both at the tree and one-loop levels.The contributions of $O(k_i)$ to the MDM are found to be suppressed relative to the corresponding contributions to the EDM by approximately three orders of magnitude. Using a recent experimental limit on the electron EDM the $|(k_2)_0-|\mathbf{k_2}|\cos\theta_\gamma|&lt;0.86\, m_e$ bound was obtained. As far as the contributions of $O(k^2_i)$ are concerned, we find that the tree-level contributions are suppressed with respect to the one-loop ones by at least a factor of $\left(m^2_l/m^2_Z\right)$. We find that the contribution to the electron MDM is by far the dominant one, as it can be up to four and seven orders of magnitude greater than those of the muon and tau, respectively. The Lorentz coefficient $(k_{AF})_\mu$ of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw's QED is given by a linear combination of $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$. Assuming that $|k^2_1|, |k^2_2|\gg |k^2_{AF}|$ and taking $(k_{AF})_\mu=0$, which implies that $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$ are collinear, we obtain an upper bound of $\left|\frac{ k^2_2}{m^2_e} \right|&lt;4.36\times 10^{-10}$. The fact that $k^2_2$ is an observer Lorentz invariant allows us to introduce a new-physics scale through $\sqrt{k^2_2}=\Lambda_{CPT}$, for which we obtain the upper limit $\Lambda_{CPT}&lt; 2.08 \times 10^{-5}\, m_e$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the Hellings Downs correlation has been observed by different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, such as NANOGrav, European PTA, Parkes PTA, and Chinese PTA. These PTA measurements of the most precise pulsars within the Milky Way show the first evidence for the stochastic gravitational wave background of our Universe. We study the ultralight axion interpretation of the new discovery by investigating the gravitational wave from axion transitions between different energy levels of the gravitational atoms, which are composed of cosmic populated Kerr black holes and their surrounding axion clouds formed through the superradiant process. By Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate that this new observation naturally admits an ultralight axion interpretation around $10^{-21}$~eV, which is consistent in magnitude with the typical mass of fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing chiral and flavored $Z^\prime$ from cosmic bursts through neutrino interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of tiny neutrino mass is an unsolved puzzle leading to a variety of phenomenological aspects beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We consider $U(1)$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM) where so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated with the help of thee generations of Majorana type right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking of $U(1)$ and electroweak gauge symmetries providing anomaly free structure. In this framework, a neutral BSM gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved. To explore the properties of its interactions we consider chiral (flavored) frameworks where $Z^\prime$ interactions depend on the handedness (generations) of the fermions. In this paper we focus on $Z^\prime-$neutrino interactions which could be probed from cosmic explosions. We consider $\nu \overline{\nu} \to e^+ e^-$ process which can energize gamma-ray burst (GRB221009A, so far the highest energy) through energy deposition. Hence estimating these rates we constrain $U(1)$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and $Z^\prime$ mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$ under Schwarzchild (Sc) and Hartle-Thorne (HT) scenarios. We also study $\nu-$DM scattering through $Z^\prime$ to constrain $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane using IceCube data considering high energy neutrinos from cosmic blazar (TXS0506+056), active galaxy (NGC1068), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Lyman-$\alpha$ data, respectively. Finally highlighting complementarity we compare our results with current and prospective bounds on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane from scattering, beam-dump and $g-2$ experiments.</description>

Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today due to the presence of experimental uncertainties. In fact, a purely kinematical triangle diagram is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements with a reasonably high accuracy of discrimination between the two seemingly identical line shapes. We also identify the type of triangle enhancement that can be misidentified as a dynamic pole structure. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a triangle singularity, but is more consistent with a pole-based interpretation, as determined solely through pure line-shape analysis. Lastly, we explain how our method can be used as a model-selection framework useful in studying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial lepton asymmetries with full neutrino transport</title>

Abstract: Primordial neutrino-antineutrino asymmetries can be constrained through big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) relic abundances and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, both observables being sensitive to neutrino properties. The latter constraint, which is due to gravitational effects from all neutrino flavors, is very minute since it is at least quadratic in the asymmetries. On the contrary, the constraints from primordial abundances presently dominate, although these abundances are almost only sensitive to the electron flavor asymmetry. It is generally assumed that neutrino asymmetries are sufficiently averaged by flavor oscillations prior to BBN, which allows one to constrain a common primordial neutrino asymmetry at the epoch of BBN. This simplified approach suffers two caveats that we deal with in this article, combining a neutrino evolution code and BBN calculation throughout the MeV era. First, flavor "equilibration" is not true in general, therefore an accurate dynamical evolution of asymmetries is needed to connect experimental observables to the primordial asymmetries. Second, the approximate averaging of asymmetries through flavor oscillations is associated to a reheating of the primordial plasma. It is therefore crucial to correctly describe the interplay between flavor equilibration and neutrino decoupling, as an energy redistribution prior to decoupling does not significantly alter the final effective number of neutrino species' value. Overall, we find that the space of allowed initial asymmetries is generically unbound when using currently available primordial abundances and CMB measurements. We forecast constraints using future CMB experiment capabilities, which should reverse this experimental misfortune.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of the relativistic axial-vector four-current distributions inside a nucleon. We show in particular that the slope of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ in the forward limit -- conventionally denoted as $R^2_A$ in the literature -- does not represent the three-dimensional mean-square axial radius in the Breit frame, but corresponds instead to a contribution to the mean-square spin radius. We derive explicit expressions for the latter in different frames and find in general additional contributions that depend on both the nucleon mass and the forward values of the axial-vector form factors $G_A(0)$ and $G_P(0)$. This provides an additional key motivation for ongoing lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations and future experimental measurements of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $G_P(Q^2)$.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of the Regge-eikonal model of hadron interaction based on the analyticity of the scattering amplitude with taking into account the hadron structure, a simultaneous analysis is carried out of 90 sets of data. These sets include the data were obtained at low energies ($\sqrt{s} &gt; 3.6 $ GeV and high energies at FNAL, ISR, $SP\bar{P}S$, TEVATRON and LHC with 4326 experimental points, including the data of $A_N$. The energy and momentum transfer dependence of separate sets of data is analyzed on the basis of the eikonalized Born amplitude with taking into account two additional anomalous terms. Different origins of the nonlinear behavior of the slope of the scattering amplitude are compared. No contribution of hard-Pomeron in the elastic hadron scattering is found. The importance of Odderon's contribution is presented. In the framework of the HEGS model, using the electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic form factors, the differential cross sections in the CNI region and at large $t$ are described well in a wide energy region simultaneously. It is shown that the cross-even part includes the soft pomeron and the additional term with a large slope have energy dependence $\ln^2(s)$. The cross-odd part includes the maximal odderon term with $\ln^{2}(s)$ and an additional oscillation term with $\ln(s)$. It is shown that the additional terms with large slope are proportional to charge distributions but the maximal odderon term and oscillation term are proportional to matter distributions. Also, a good description of proton-neutron differential scattering with 526 experimental points is obtained on the basis of the amplitudes taken from the analysis of $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ scattering. A good description of the $A_N$ data was also obtained.</description>

      <title>Charged pions asymmetry from the decay of light neutral axial mesons due to interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective three meson couplings, based in flavor U(3) quark-antiquark interactions, are considered to describe two light neutral axial meson Strong decays, $A \sim f_1(1285)$ and $f_{1S} (1420)$, and the charged rho meson decay in the following channels: $A \to \rho^\mp (770)+ \pi^\pm$, $A\to a_0^\mp (980) +\pi^\pm$ and $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$. By considering neutral meson mixings, such as $f_1(1285) - a_1^0(1260)$, $f_{1S}(1420) - a_1^0(1260)$ and $\eta-\pi^0$ for the channels investigated, the leading three-meson interactions may lead to decay amplitudes that undergo interference and a resulting ratio of decay rate into charged pions, $\Gamma_{\pi^+}/\Gamma_{\pi^-}$, slightly smaller than one. For that it will be assumed that the produced charged vector mesons or charged scalar mesons undergo absorption, decay into channels without charged pions, or any other inelastic process that may suppress their decays into charged pions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a spin 2 resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A420Z could come from a H650 resonance degenerate in mass with T650. We propose a scheme in which scalar resonances are accommodated in three doublets, T650 in an isosinglet, T450++, T375+ and T350 belong to an isofiveplet.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Here we give it a possible description via probability distributions of energy and/or degrees of freedom. There are parameter spaces that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boosted dark matter constitutes a small fraction of the total dark matter in the universe, with mass ranging from eV to MeV and often exhibiting (semi)relativistic velocity. Hence the likelihood of detecting boosted dark matter in earth-based direct detection experiments is relatively high. There is more than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter(subdominant) including the two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter species(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter particles in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter species is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves very high velocity. These boosted dark matter particles suffer from elastic scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere and the earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the kinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two component dark matter scenario, we show that the boost of the dark matter, kinetic energy and its attenuation highly depend on the dark matter masses. We perform a detailed study of the attenuation of boosted dark matter as a function of the DM-nucleus (without/with form factor) and DM-electron cross sections. For a 10 MeV dark matter with boost $\sim$ 10-100, the effect of DM-electron scattering is found to be severe than the DM-nucleus scattering (with form factor) for scattering cross sections $\sim 10^{-29}$cm$^2$. We also found that the attenuation of the kinetic energy results in a shift in the peak position of the boosted dark matter flux.</description>

      <title>Exploring New Physics in transition $b\to s\,\ell^+\ell^-$ through different $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the discrepancies observed in the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ neutral current decays, we study the decay channel $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=\mu,\tau$), which is based on the same flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) transition at the quark level. The current study shows that this decay channel can provide a useful probe for physics beyond the standard model. We use the helicity formalism while employing the effective theory approach where we include the effects of vector and axial vector `new' physics (NP) operators. In this study, we have computed the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}_r$, the $D^\ast$ helicity fraction $f_L$, the lepton forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{FB}$, and the lepton flavor universality ratio (LFU) $R^{\tau\mu}_{D_s^*}$. In addition, as a complementary check on the LFU, we also calculate the various other LFU observables, $R_{i}^{\tau\mu}$ where $i=A_{FB}$, $f_L$. We assume that the NP universal coupling is present for both muons and tauons, while the non-universal coupling is only present for muons. Regarding these couplings, we employ the latest global fit to the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data, which is recently computed in arXiv:2304.07330. We give predictions of some of the mentioned observables within the SM and the various NP scenarios. We have found that not only are the considered observables sensitive to NP but are also helpful in distinguishing among the different NP scenarios. These results can be tested at the LHCb, HL-LHC, and FCC-ee, and therefore, a precise measurements of these observables not only deepens our understanding of the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ process but also provides a window of opportunity to possibly study various NP scenarios.</description>

      <title>Superconnections in AdS/QCD and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hard-wall AdS/QCD models extended by a string-theory inspired Chern-Simons action in terms of a superconnection involving a bi-fundamental scalar field which corresponds to the open-string tachyon of brane-antibrane configurations and which is naturally identified with the holographic dual of the quark condensate in chiral symmetry breaking. This realizes both the axial and chiral anomalies of QCD with a Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the $\eta'$ mass in addition to current quark masses, but somewhat differently than in the Katz-Schwartz AdS/QCD model used previously by us to evaluate pseudoscalar and axial vector transition form factors and their contribution to the HLBL piece of the muon $g-2$. Compared to the Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description of axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon rates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found to be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar transition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the $\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate non-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however, a result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.</description>

Abstract: Amongst the issues plaguing the Standard Model (SM) are questions pertaining to neutrino masses and mixings, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and muon and the problem of a suitable dark matter (DM) candidate. All the three issues can be addressed at once by extending the SM with two generations of vector-like fermions and an inert scalar doublet, all odd under a Z2 symmetry. The light neutrino masses and mixings are generated radiatively while maintaining consistency with bounds on lepton flavor violation. Loop diagrams with the very same fields also serve to explain the anomalous magnetic moments. Similarly, the correct dark matter relic abundance is reproduced without coming into conflict with direct detection constraints, or those from big bang nucleosynthesis or the cosmic microwave observations. Finally, prospective signatures at the LHC are discussed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of hidden-charm pentaquarks as triangle singularities via deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the nature of near-threshold enhancements is hindered by the limited resolution of experimental data leading to multiple conflicting interpretations. A prominent example of ambiguous line shape is the set of pentaquark signals observed by LHCb in 2019. Some of these signals can be interpreted as hadronic molecule, compact state, virtual state, or due to a kinematical triangle mechanism. In this work, we leverage the model-selection capability of deep neural networks to analyze and identify the nature of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$. We trained a set of deep neural networks using line shapes with enhancements produced by triangle singularities and those produced by nearby poles. The training dataset for the triangle enhancements are generated by using a set of hadrons satisfying the required mass condition. The training line shapes for the pole-based classifications are generated using uniformized independent $S$-matrix poles configured to appear close to the relevant threshold. We found that, despite the presence of experimental uncertainties, the triangle mechanism is ruled out by the experimental data. The results also suggest that the data favor the pole-shadow pair interpretation for the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$, which corresponds to a characteristic pole structure involving a resonance in a two-channel scattering system. Our result is consistent with the initial analysis done by LHCb favoring the Breit-Wigner fit over the triangle singularity. The present analysis offers an alternative approach to studying line shapes, supplementing the standard fitting methods.</description>

Abstract: Our understanding of high-lying states within the charmonium family remains incomplete, particularly in light of recent observations of charmonium states at energies above 4 GeV. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of several high-lying charmonia, focusing on the $D$-, $F$-, and $G$-wave states. A mass spectrum analysis is conducted, incorporating the unquenched effects. We then present a detailed study of the strong decay properties, including partial decay widths for two-body strong decays permitted by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule. Additionally, we explore the primary radiative decay channels associated with these states. Theoretical predictions provided here aim to guide future experimental searches for high-lying charmonium states, particularly at BESIII, Belle II and LHCb.</description>

      <title>A New Herwig7 Underlying Event Tune: from RHIC to LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present parameter sets corresponding to new underlying event tunes for the Herwig7.3 Monte Carlo event generator. The existing Herwig tunes are in good agreement with LHC data, however, they are not typically designed for center-of-mass energies below $\sqrt{s}=300$ GeV. The tunes presented in this study can describe mid-rapidity data collected at the nominal RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s }=200$ GeV, as well as higher center-of-mass energies utilized by experiments elsewhere, such as the LHC. The base "New Haven" tune is developed by fitting minimum-bias simulations of proton-proton collisions to mid-rapidity identified hadron and jet data from the STAR experiment. The "Nashville" tune includes a separate set of parameters developed by tuning to Tevatron proton-antiproton data at $\sqrt{s}=300$, $900$ and $1960$ GeV from CDF, and LHC proton-proton measurements from CMS at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, in addition to the STAR measurements. Both new tunes demonstrate significant improvements over the recommended default tune currently included in the latest version of Herwig for minimum bias production. As such, we advocate using these tunes for future simulation studies at mid-rapidity by the experimental collaborations at RHIC (STAR and sPHENIX) and the LHC (ATLAS, ALICE, CMS).</description>

      <title>Medium effects on freeze-out of light clusters at NICA energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.07645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the chemical freeze-out of light nuclear clusters for NICA energies of above 2 A GeV. On the one hand we use results from the low energy domain of about 35 A MeV, where medium effects have been shown to be important to explain experimental results. On the high energy side of LHC energies the statistical model without medium effects has provided results for the chemical freeze-out. The two approaches extrapolated to NICA energies show a discrepancy that can be attributed to medium effects and that for the deuteron/proton ratio amounts to a factor of about three. These findings underline the importance of a detailed investigation of light cluster production at NICA energies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part I. Limits on orientable Euclidean manifolds from circle searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Trans-series from condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules provide a method to obtain trans-series expansions in many quantum field theories, in which exponentially small corrections are calculated by combining the operator product expansion with the assumption of vacuum condensates. In some solvable models, exact expressions for trans-series can be obtained from non-perturbative results, and this makes it possible to test the SVZ method by comparing its predictions to these exact trans-series. In this paper we perform such a precision test in the example of the fermion self-energy in the Gross-Neveu model. Its exact trans-series expansion can be extracted from the large $N$ solution, at the first non-trivial order in $1/N$. It is given by an infinite series of exponentially small corrections involving factorially divergent power series in the 't Hooft parameter. We show that the first two corrections are associated to two-quark and four-quark condensates, and we reproduce the corresponding power series exactly, and at all loops, by using the SVZ method. In addition, the numerical values of the condensates can be extracted from the exact result, up to order $1/N$.</description>

      <title>Search for $CP$-Violating Neutrino Nonstandard Interactions with the NOvA Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter reports a search for charge-parity ($CP$) symmetry violating nonstandard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter using the NOvA Experiment, and examines their effects on the determination of the standard oscillation parameters. Data from $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})$ and $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e})$ oscillation channels are used to measure the effect of the NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\varepsilon_{e\tau}$. With 90% CL the magnitudes of the NSI couplings are constrained to be $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \, \lesssim 0.3$ and $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \lesssim 0.4$. A degeneracy at $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \approx 1.8$ is reported, and we observe that the presence of NSI limits sensitivity to the standard $CP$ phase $\delta_{\tiny\text{CP}}$.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Impact of Brane-Chern-Simons Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel extension of massive gravity theory; the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory. We explore the cosmological implications of this theory by deriving the background equations and demonstrating the existence of self-accelerating solutions. Interestingly, our theory suggests the existence of self-accelerating mechanisms that originate from an effective cosmological constant, leading to intriguing possibilities for understanding the nature of cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we perform a tensor perturbation analysis to investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in this framework. We derive the dispersion relation for gravitational waves and study their behavior in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Waker cosmology within the context of Brane-Chen-Simons massive gravity. Utilizing the latest Union2 type Ia supernova dataset comprising $557$ SNIa events, we provide observational support for our theoretical framework, indicating that the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory is consistent with cosmological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is determined solely by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario - a localized finite-sized atomic target - and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correcting for detector effects in experimental data, particularly through unfolding, is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel approach to multidimensional object-wise unfolding using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, incorporating distribution moments as conditioning information, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions, while enabling the unfolding of a wide range of measured distributions with improved adaptability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Interacting Models of Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the interacting models between the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field and the dark matter fluid in a homogeneous and isotropic background. A key feature of GB coupling models is the varying speed of gravitational waves (GWs). We utilize recent constraints on the GW speed and conduct our analysis in two primary scenarios: model-dependent and model-independent. In the model-dependent scenario, where determining the GW speed requires a specific GB coupling functional form, we choose an exponential GB coupling. We adopt a dynamical system analysis to obtain the necessary constraints on the model parameters that describe different phases of the universe and produce a stable late-time accelerating solution following the GW constraint, and find that to satisfy all these constraints, fine-tuning of the free parameters involved in the models is often needed. In the model-independent scenario, the GW speed is fixed to one, and we construct the autonomous system to identify the late-time stable accelerating critical points. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian inference method using late-time observational data sets, including 31 data points from cosmic chronometer data (Hubble data) and 1701 data points from Pantheon+ and find that all the observational constraints can be satisfied without fine-tuning. In addition, we also utilize simulated binned Roman and LSST data to study the evolution of the universe in the model-independent scenario. We find that the model shows significant deviation at higher redshifts from $\Lambda$CDM and fits the current data much better than $\Lambda$CDM within the error bars.</description>

      <title>Kicking the Tires on Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2 \times 10^{-16} M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12} M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 2 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of a fluctuating spacetime due to a deformed commutation relation with a fluctuating deformation parameter, or to a fluctuating metric tensor. By computing the resulting dynamics and averaging over these fluctuations, we find that a system experiences a decoherence in the momentum basis. We studied the predictions of the model for a free particle and an harmonic oscillator. Using experimental data taken from a mechanical oscillator prepared in quantum states of motion, we put a bound on the free parameters of the considered model. In addition, we comment on how these measurements can also provide bounds to other phenomenological quantum gravity models, such as the length scale for nonlocal dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>
