      <title>DW Cnc: a micronova with a negative superhump and a flickering spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables have been known to show bursts driven by different physical mechanisms; however, the burst occurrence is much rarer than in their non-magnetic counterparts. DW Cnc is a well-studied intermediate polar that showed a burst with a 4-magnitude amplitude in 2007. Here we report on a recent burst in DW Cnc observed by ASAS-SN that reached a peak luminosity of 6.6 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg~s$^{-1}$, another 4 mag increase from its quiescent high state level. The released energy of the burst suggests that these are micronovae, a distinctive type of burst seen in magnetic systems that may be caused by a thermonuclear runaway in the confined accretion flow. Only a handful of systems, most of them intermediate polars, have a reported micronova bursts. We also report on the reappearance of the negative superhump of DW~Cnc as shown by TESS and OPTICAM data after the system emerges from its low state and immediately before the burst. We further report on a new phenomenon, where the spin signal turns "on" and "off" on the precession period associated with the negative superhump, which may indicate pole flipping. The new classification of DW Cnc as a micronova as well as the spin variability show the importance of both monitoring known micronova systems and systematic searches for more similar bursts, to limit reliance on serendipitous discoveries.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Evidence for Two New Candidate Transitional Millisecond Pulsars in the Sub-luminous Disk State: 4FGL J0639.1--8009 and 4FGL J1824.2+1231</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two new Galactic accreting compact objects consistent with the respective positions of the unassociated Fermi-LAT gamma-ray sources 4FGL J0639.1--8009 and 4FGL J1824.2+1231. A combination of new and archival X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, and eROSITA reveals a variable X-ray source in each gamma-ray error ellipse. Both candidate counterparts show power-law spectra with photon indices $\Gamma \sim 1.7-1.9$. Optical follow-up photometry and spectroscopy show rapid high-amplitude variability unrelated to orbital motion and persistent accretion disk spectra for both objects. We demonstrate that the properties of these X-ray/optical sources are at odds with the known phenomenology of accreting white dwarfs, but are consistent with the observed properties of the sub-luminous disk state of transitional millisecond pulsars. This brings the census of confirmed or candidate transitional millisecond pulsars in the Galactic field to nine. We show this potentially represents $\lesssim 10\%$ of the total population of transitional millisecond pulsars within 8 kpc.</description>

      <title>Relativistic ions with power-law spectra explain radio phoenixes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio phoenixes are filamentary sources in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, often extending over $&gt;100$ kpc, arising from fossil radio lobes. Their soft, curved spectrum is widely attributed to aged relativistic electrons recently accelerated or compressed, but at high frequencies is shown to approach a power-law. Moreover, the full, curved spectrum is naturally reproduced by secondary $e^{\pm}$ from a pure power-law spectrum of relativistic ions, radiating in highly-magnetized filaments; this model provides a better fit to all phoenixes, with only three free parameters. Weaker magnetization shifts the curvature to low frequencies, explaining pure power-law phoenixes. Hadronic high-curvature phoenixes require $e^{\pm}$ heating, by a factor $\gtrsim 15$ if at ICM pressure. The $\sim$keV Compton- and $\sim$GeV $\pi^0$-decay-peaked counterparts of hadronic phoenixes may be detectable as non-thermal X-rays and $\gamma$-rays.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Sources of Cosmic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than a decade ago, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered a diffuse flux of 10 TeV - 10 PeV neutrinos from our Universe. This flux of unknown origin most likely emanates from an extragalactic population of neutrino sources, which are individually too faint to appear as bright emitters. We review constraints on extragalactic neutrino source populations based on the non-detection of the brightest neutrino source. Extending previous work, we discuss limitations of source populations based on general neutrino luminosity functions. Our method provides more conservative but also statistically more robust predictions for the expected number of observable sources. We also show that the combined search of the brightest neutrino sources via weighted stacking searches or the analysis of non-Poissonian fluctuations in event-count histograms can improve the discovery potential by a factor of 2-3 relative to the brightest source.</description>

      <title>Reprocessing from highly ionized gas in the soft spectral state of V4641 Sgr with NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V4641 Sgr is a low-mass black hole X-ray binary system with somewhat puzzling spectral characteristics during its soft state. Recent high-resolution spectroscopic studies of V4641 Sgr have revealed strong ionized emission line features in both the optical and X-ray bands, including P-Cygni signatures, and an unusually low soft state luminosity, indicating that the central engine is obscured. Here we present an analysis of five NuSTAR observations of V4641 Sgr taken during its recent outburst in 2021, when the source was in the soft state. We identify highly ionized Fe K emission lines, consistent with a combination of the near-neutral $6.4$~keV Fe K$\alpha$ line, and the H-like and He-like Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ transitions found at $6.7\mbox{--}7$~keV and $\sim8$~keV, and find no evidence for strong relativistic broadening. The line fluxes correlate linearly with the observed disk continuum flux, implying a direct connection between the central engine and the reprocessing region. Most interestingly, all five spectra also show a persistent highly ionized Fe K continuum edge feature at $\sim9$~keV with a stable optical depth, which is likely smeared, implying a localized reprocessing zone. We find tentative supporting evidence for obscuration of the inner accretion disk based on its unusually low intrinsic luminosity, however, the NuSTAR spectra do not require obscuration from cold, optically thick gas.</description>

      <title>The discovery of a 41-second radio pulsar PSR J0311+1402 with ASKAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging population of long-period radio transients (LPTs) show both similarities and differences with normal pulsars. A key difference is that their radio emission is too bright to be powered solely by rotational energy. Various models have been proposed (including both white-dwarf or neutron star origins), and their nature remains uncertain. Known LPTs have minutes to hours long spin periods, while normal pulsars have periods ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Here, we report the discovery of PSR J0311+1402, an object with an intermediate spin period of 41 seconds, bridging the gap between LPTs and normal pulsars. PSR J0311+1402 exhibits low linear ($\sim25\%$) and circular polarisation ($\sim5\%$) and a relatively steep spectral index ($\sim-2.3$), features similar to normal pulsars. However, its observed spin-down properties place it below the pulsar death line, where pair production and thus radio emission are expected to cease. The discovery of PSR J0311+1402 suggests the existence of a previously undetected population within this intermediate period range, presumably missed due to selection biases in traditional pulsar search methods. Finding more such objects is important to fill the current gap in neutron star spin periods, improving our understanding of the relationships among rotation-powered pulsars and LPTs.</description>

      <title>Emission and Absorption Lines in Photospheric Radius Expansion Bursts of 4U 1820$-$30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the emission and absorption lines during photospheric radius expansion (PRE) X-ray bursts from the ultracompact binary 4U 1820--30, observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the significance, we identified a 1 keV emission line from 14 bursts, a 3 keV absorption line from 12 bursts, and 1.6 keV absorption from one burst. By coadding the burst spectra at the maximum radius phase, we detected a 1.034 keV emission line with significance of $14.2\sigma$, and absorption lines at 1.64 and 3 keV with significances of $10.8\sigma$ and $11.7\sigma$, respectively. The observed energy shifts are consistent with the prediction from the burst-driven wind model, indicating that all three spectral features are produced by the PRE wind. Analysis of the ratios between the emission and absorption line energies suggests that the 1 keV feature is a superposition of several narrower Fe L-shell lines. To evaluate the scientific capabilities of the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS), we simulated mock observations of multiple narrow lines near 1 keV. The results demonstrate that HUBS is well suited for detailed studies of the 1 keV emission line during bursts, offering significant potential to advance our understanding of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>A radio transient with unusually slow periodic emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-frequency radio sky is bursting with synchrotron transients from massive stellar explosions and accretion events, but the low-frequency radio sky has so far been quiet beyond the Galactic pulsar population and the long-term scintillation of AGN. The low-frequency band, however, is sensitive to exotic coherent and polarised radio emission processes such as electron cyclotron maser emission from flaring M-dwarfs [1], stellar magnetospheric plasma interactions with exoplanets [2], and a population of steep-spectrum pulsars [3], making Galactic plane searches a prospect for blind transient discovery. Here we report an analysis of archival low-frequency radio data that reveals a periodic, low-frequency radio transient. We find that the source pulses every 18.18 minutes, an unusual periodicity not previously observed. The emission is highly linearly polarised, bright, persists for 30--60 s on each occurrence, and is visible across a broad frequency range. At times the pulses comprise short ($&lt;0.5$-s) duration bursts; at others, a smoother profile is observed. These profiles evolve on timescales of hours. By measuring the dispersion of the radio pulses with respect to frequency, we have localised the source to within our own Galaxy, and suggest that it could be an ultra-long period magnetar.</description>

      <title>A long-period radio transient active for three decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently several long-period radio transients have been discovered, with strongly polarised coherent radio pulses appearing on timescales between tens to thousands of seconds [1,2]. In some cases the radio pulses have been interpreted as coming from rotating neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields, known as magnetars; the origin of other, occasionally periodic and less well-sampled radio transients, is still debated [3]. Coherent periodic radio emission is usually explained by rotating dipolar magnetic fields and pair production mechanisms, but such models do not easily predict radio emission from such slowly-rotating neutron stars and maintain it for extended times. On the other hand, highly magnetic isolated white dwarfs would be expected to have long spin periodicities, but periodic coherent radio emission has not yet been directly detected from these sources. Here we report observations of a long-period (21 minutes) radio transient, which we have labeled GPMJ1839-10. The pulses vary in brightness by two orders of magnitude, last between 30 and 300 seconds, and have quasi-periodic substructure. The observations prompted a search of radio archives, and we found that the source has been repeating since at least 1988. The archival data enabled constraint of the period derivative to $&lt;3.6\times10^{-13}$s s$^{-1}$, which is at the very limit of any classical theoretical model that predicts dipolar radio emission from an isolated neutron star.</description>

      <title>Investigating Disc-Corona Interaction in Axisymmetric Accretion Disc Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between the accretion disc and its corona plays a critical role in the energy balance and emission mechanisms in astrophysical systems such as active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. However, the detailed physics of disc-corona interactions, including the mechanisms driving disc evaporation, and the impact of accretion rate and viscosity, remains poorly understood. Our study aims to extend the well-known disc evaporation model to investigate the disc-corona interaction in a 2D axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic model, focusing on the effects of viscosity, accretion rate, and their influence on disc evaporation, luminosity, and corona formation. We develop a hydrodynamic model consisting of a thin accretion disc, a corona, and a vacuum region. Our model is implemented in \textit{Athena++}, with the gas-vacuum interface tracking algorithm to handle the vacuum regions. We perform simulations incorporating turbulent viscosity, thermal conduction, Bremsstrahlung cooling, and artificial disc cooling, starting from an adiabatic state to explore the disc-corona interaction. We demonstrate the presence of acoustic shock heating, a mechanism widely studied in the solar physics community but less explored in the context of accretion discs. We find that the viscosity dominates the intensity of disc evaporation, the accretion rate primarily determines the disc truncation radius and the disc luminosity, and there may be a positive correlation between the corona luminosity and the evaporation intensity. We also compare our results with the observations and simulations, and estimate the $y$-parameters to explore the potential effects of Compton cooling.</description>

      <title>Outflowing photoionized plasma in Circinus X-1 using the high-resolution X-ray spectrometer Resolve onboard XRISM and the radiative transfer code cloudy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a key to understanding the mass inflow and outflow of compact objects. Spectral lines carry information about the ionization, density, and velocity structures through their intensity ratios and profiles. They are formed in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions under the intense radiation field from the compact objects, thus radiative transfer (RT) calculation is a requisite for proper interpretations. We present such a study for a low-mass X-ray binary, Circinus X-1, from which the P Cygni profile was discovered using the X-ray grating spectrometer onboard Chandra. We observed the source using the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard XRISM at an orbital phase of 0.93-0.97 and revealed many spectral features unidentified before; the higher series transitions (n to 1; n &gt; 2) of highly-ionized (H- and He-like) S, Ca, Ar, and Fe in emission and absorption, the Fe K{\alpha} and K\b{eta} inner-shell excitation absorption of mildly-ionized (O- to Li-like) Fe, and resolved fine-structure level transitions in the Fe Ly{\alpha} and He{\alpha} complexes. They blend with each other at different velocity shifts on top of apparently variable continuum emission that changed its flux by an order of magnitude within a 70 ks telescope time. Despite such complexity in the observed spectra, most of them can be explained by a simple model consisting of the photoionized plasma outflowing at ~300 km s-1 and the variable blocking material in the line of sight of the incident continuum emission from the accretion disk. We demonstrate this with the aid of the RT code cloudy for the line ratio diagnostics and spectral fitting. We further constrain the physical parameters of the outflow and argue that the outflow is launched close to the outer edge of the accretion disk and can be driven radiatively by being assisted by the line force calculated using the RT simulation.</description>

      <title>Employing deep-learning techniques for the conservative-to-primitive recovery in binary neutron star simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of GW170817, together with its electromagnetic counterparts, has proven that binary neutron star mergers are of central importance to the field of nuclear astrophysics, e.g., through a better understanding of the formation of elements and novel constraints on the supranuclear dense equation of state governing the matter inside neutron stars. Essential for understanding the binary coalescence are numerical-relativity simulations, which typically come with high computational costs requiring high-performance computing facilities. In this work, we build on recent studies to investigate whether novel techniques, such as neural networks, can be employed in the conversion of conservative variables to primitive hydrodynamical variables, such as pressure and density. In this regard, we perform -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first binary neutron star merger simulations in which such methods are employed. We show that this method results in stable simulations, reaching accuracies similar to traditional methods with an overall comparable computational cost. These simulations serve as a proof of principle that, in the future, deep learning techniques could be used within numerical-relativity simulations. However, further improvements are necessary to offer a computational advantage compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Probing Globular Cluster with MeerKAT and FAST: A Pulsar Polarization Census</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only one globular cluster (GC), 47 Tuc, has been found to contain intracluster medium, with an electron density 100 times higher than that of the ISM in its vicinity. The characteristics of this intracluster medium are closely related to GC evolution and the compact objects within. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the ionized gas content of GCs, particularly in Galactic halo clusters. We carried out a polarization census of GC pulsars using MeerKAT and FAST. This first combined effort of observations from these two major radio telescopes resulted in high signal-to-noise ratio, full polarization pulse profiles for 43 pulsars in 8 GCs, doubling the number of rotation measures (RMs) known in these clusters. The accuracy of dispersion measures (DMs) was improved by a factor of 8 compared to previous publications. No intracluster medium was found, and at least two halo GCs showed more stringent upper limits on electron density than that detected in 47 Tuc. The surprising barrenness of GCs suggests effective gas removal mechanisms, such as strong winds from millisecond pulsars and/or ionizing radiation from post-AGB stars and young white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Search for weak components in pulsar radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for weak components outside the main pulse (MP) in the radiation of pulsars at a frequency of 110 MHz observed on the LPA LPI telescope in the Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search (PUMPS) has been carried out. The sample included 96 pulsars, for which the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the MP of the average profile during accumulation over 10 years was more than 40. It was found that PSR J1543+0929 has radiation for almost the entire period. The profile is three-component. The relative amplitudes of the lateral weak components are 0.013 and 0.026. For PSR J2234+2114, a precursor was detected that is $53^o$ away from MP.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Spectral Variability of Thirteen TeV High Energy Peaked Blazars with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray spectral variability observed in 13 TeV photon emitting high energy peaked BL Lacs(HBLs). These data come from 54 XMM-Newton EPIC-PN pointed observations made during its operational period from June 2001 through July 2023. We performed spectral studies in the energy range 0.6-10 keV by fitting X-ray spectra of the pointed observations with power law (PL) and log parabolic (LP) models. We found at 99% confidence level that 31 of these X-ray spectra were best fitted with a range of LP models with local photon indices (at 1.0 keV), alpha in the range of 1.75-2.66, and convex curvature parameter beta in the range of 0.02-0.25. PL models with photon index Gamma in the range of 1.78-2.68 best described the spectra of fourteen-pointed observations. Nine PN spectra resulted in negative curvature parameters in fitting an LP model, and eight among them were significant (beta is at least twice beta_err). We fitted broken power law (BPL) models to these eight X-ray spectra and found spectral hardening (Delta_Gamma) in the range of 0.06-0.54 for these observations. EPIC-MOS spectra were also studied for those eight observations to search for similar trends, and we were able to find them in only two, one observation each of PKS 0548-322 and Mrk 501. This indicates the possibility of the co-existence of an inverse Compton component along with the dominant synchrotron component for these two observations. We also performed correlation studies between various log-parabolic spectral parameters and briefly discuss their possible implications.</description>

      <title>Physics of Pair Producing Gaps in Black Hole Magnetospheres: Two Dimensional General Relativistic Particle-in-cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes can launch powerful jets through the Blandford-Znajek process. This relies on enough plasma in the jet funnel to conduct the necessary current. However, in some low luminosity active galactic nuclei, the plasma supply near the jet base may be an issue. It has been proposed that spark gaps -- local regions with unscreened electric field -- can form in the magnetosphere, accelerating particles to initiate pair cascades, thus filling the jet funnel with plasma. In this paper, we carry out 2D general relativistic particle-in-cell (GRPIC) simulations of the gap, including self-consistent treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production. We observe gap dynamics that is fully consistent with our earlier 1D GRPIC simulations. We find strong dependence of the gap power on the soft photon spectrum and energy density, as well as the strength of the horizon magnetic field. We derive physically motivated scaling relations, and applying to M87, we find that the gap may be energetically viable for the observed TeV flares. For Sgr A$^*$, the energy dissipated in the gap may also be sufficient to power the X-ray flares.</description>

      <title>JWST's First View of Tidal Disruption Events: Compact, Accretion-Driven Emission Lines &amp; Strong Silicate Emission in an Infrared-selected Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (MIR) emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) is a powerful probe of the circumnuclear environment around dormant supermassive black holes. This emission arises from the reprocessing of intrinsic emission into thermal MIR emission by circumnuclear dust. While the majority of optical- and X-ray-selected TDEs show only weak dust echoes consistent with primarily unobscured sight lines, there have been growing efforts aimed at finding TDEs in obscured environments using MIR selection methods. In this work, we present the first JWST observations of 4 MIR-selected TDEs with JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). Two of these sources show flares in other wavelength bands (one in optical, one in X-ray), while the other two are MIR-only transients. None of these TDEs showed pre-outburst nuclear activity, but all of the MIRI/MRS observations reveal emission lines associated with highly ionized gas, implying ionization from TDE accretion. Additionally, all four sources show silicate emission features around 10 and 18 $\mu$m that are much stronger than the features seen in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We suggest that the emitting dust is optically thin to its own emission and show that the MIR spectrum is consistent with emission from optically thin dust along an isodelay surface. All four sources show an excess at short wavelengths ($\lambda &lt; 8\, \mu$m), which could arise from a late-time plateau in the intrinsic flare, akin to what is seen in late-time UV observations of unobscured TDEs, although self-consistent dust modeling is required to fully assess the strength of this late-time plateau.</description>

      <title>Extreme Jet Beaming Observed in Neutrino-Associated Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them over recent years. A particularly strong observational connection is present between neutrinos and blazars with bright, Doppler-boosted, parsec-scale radio emission. In this work, we further explore the nature of this connection by examining the jet geometry and kinematics of neutrino-associated blazars. We find that these blazars demonstrate remarkably strong jet beaming, even compared to other radio-bright sources. Their Doppler and Lorentz factors are larger, and viewing angles are smaller than for other blazars in the complete uniformly selected MOJAVE sample. Observationally, this serves as yet another piece of evidence for blazars forming a major population of neutrino sources. The strong neutrino-beaming correlation indicates that high-energy neutrino velocity is predominantly oriented along the jet, and the original PeV-scale protons exhibit a relativistic bulk motion along the jet. It suggests that neutrino production happens not too close to the black hole, but rather at sub-parsec distances, where the jet is already accelerated.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

      <title>Explaining the KM3-230213A Detection without Gamma-Ray Emission: Cosmic-Ray Dark Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a high-energy neutrino event, designated KM3-230213A, was observed by the KM3NeT/ARCA detector in the Mediterranean Sea. This event is characterized by a reconstructed muon energy of approximately 120 PeV, corresponding to a median neutrino energy of roughly 220 PeV. To understand the origin, it is essential to investigate consistency with multi-messenger observations--particularly gamma-ray constraints--in various theoretical scenarios within and beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by this, we explore the possibility that the detected event does not originate from conventional neutrinos but rather from right-handed neutrinos (sterile neutrinos) mixing with active neutrinos, leading to the observed muon signal. Such cosmic-ray dark radiation may have originated either in the early Universe or through dark matter decay in the present epoch. We show that in both cases, while satisfying existing general constraints on light sterile neutrinos, the stringent multi-messenger gamma-ray limits can be significantly alleviated. A distinct prediction of this scenario is that such events can arrive from directions through Earth that would typically attenuate conventional neutrinos. A related scenario involving cosmic-ray boosted WIMP dark matter is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Cosmic Neutrino Background Capture on Astrophysical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic background are captured by objects in the sky that contain material susceptible of single beta decay. Neutrons, which compose most of a neutron star, capture low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic neutrino background and release a high-energy electron in the MeV range. Also, planets contain unstable isotopes that capture the cosmic neutrinos. We show that this process is feasible and results in a non-negligible flux of electrons in the MeV range in neutron stars. We present a novel observable, the redshift evolution of the temperature of neutron stars due to neutrino capture, that could provide a route for detection of the cosmic neutrino background from future gravitational waves observatories. For planets the flux is significantly smaller and a measurement is not possible with currently envisioned technology. While the signature from neutron stars is small and challenging, it could result in a novel way to detect the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest cosmic ray detector, plays a pivotal role in exploring the frontiers of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. By the observation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, Auger provides critical insights into two major scenarios: super heavy dark matter and Lorentz invariance violation. Super heavy dark matter, hypothesized to originate in the early universe, offers a compelling explanation for the dark matter problem and is constrained by Auger through searches for photons and neutrinos resulting from its decay. Lorentz invariance violations, motivated by quantum gravity theories implying deviations from fundamental symmetries, are probed by Auger through alterations of the particle dispersion relation and the energy thresholds of their interactions with astrophysical photons backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of the black hole photon ring as a probe of ultralight dilaton fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have facilitated unprecedented probing of superradiant phenomena in the vicinities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), establishing an ideal laboratory to detect ultralight bosons beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we delve into how ultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the form $f(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing simulations covering a range of plasma densities and dilaton coupling strengths, we reveal a periodic distortion in the photon ring morphology, with the periodicity aligning with that of the dilaton-driven plasma frequency oscillations. We then assess the magnitude of this effect under the current angular resolution constraints of VLBI observations. Our analysis indicates that a comprehensive search for superradiant dilaton clouds based on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling would necessitate radio interferometric baselines significantly exceeding the Earth's diameter to resolve the corresponding signatures.</description>

      <title>Another one (BH+OB pair) bites the dust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most (or possibly all) massive stars reside in multiple systems. From stellar evolution models, numerous systems with an OB star coupled to a black hole would be expected to exist. There have been several claimed detections of such pairs in recent years and this is notably the case of HD96670. Using high-quality photometry and spectroscopy in the optical range, we revisited the HD96670 system. We also examined complementary X-ray observations to provide a broader view of the system properties. The TESS light curves of HD96670 clearly show eclipses, ruling out the black hole companion scenario. This does not mean that the system is not of interest. Indeed, the combined analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data indicates that the system most likely consists of a O8.5 giant star paired with a stripped-star companion with a mass of ~4.5Msol, a radius of ~1Rsol, and a surface temperature of ~50kK. While several B+sdOB systems have been reported in the literature, this would be the first case of a Galactic system composed of an O star and a faint stripped star. In addition, the system appears brighter and harder than normal OB stars in the X-ray range, albeit less so than for X-ray binaries. The high-energy observations provide hints of phase-locked variations, as typically seen in colliding wind systems. As a post-interaction system, HD96670 actually represents a key case for probing binary evolution, even if it is not ultimately found to host a black hole.</description>

      <title>Utilizing localized fast radio bursts to constrain their progenitors and the expansion history of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are increasingly being used for cosmological applications such as measuring the Hubble constant and baryon abundance. The increasing number of localized FRBs and precise measurement of dispersion measure (DM) make them a suitable probe for such an approach. We use a sample of 110 localized FRBs as well as a small sub-sample of 24 FRBs with scattering timescale measurements or limits. We infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the DM distribution of the host galaxies simultaneously by fitting our model to the FRB DM measurements. With current data, our results are in agreement with both high and low redshift measurements of $H_0$, obtained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae data respectively. We project that with about 200 localized FRBs, we would be in a position to distinguish between the two scenarios at 4$\sigma$ confidence. In addition, the host DM is expected to be related to star formation in the host galaxy and the stellar age of the progenitors. Using our inferred host galaxy DMs, we are able to rule out (at 95 percent confidence) a majority of localized FRB progenitors originating from young sources with stellar ages less than 10 Myr. This might reflect a large population of old sources or an observational bias against detecting FRBs from young sources, which may be associated with long scatter broadening times and large DM from their source environments. Indeed, we find that scatter broadening times of FRBs are inconsistent with the Milky Way ISM, but at the same time, do not appear to be strongly correlated with the FRBs' redshift or with the SFR or stellar mass of their host galaxies. This suggests that scattering is dominated by the immediate environment of the sources.</description>

      <title>Effect of generic dark matter halo on transonic accretion onto galactic black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environment surrounding a black hole or black hole binaries is generally expected to play an important role in understanding various astrophysical phenomena around them. In this paper, we study relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic supermassive black hole dressed with a cold dark matter halo. Focusing on different relativistic dark matter distributions with an inner density spike, we analyze the effect of the dark matter halo on the topology and properties of the accretion flow. Our results show enhancement of disk luminosity in the presence of dark matter, which depends on the nature and properties (halo mass and compactness) of the dark matter distribution. Since the dominant contribution to the disk luminosity for compact and massive halo comes from the inner region of the accretion disk, our analysis suggests that luminosity measurement can indeed be useful to probe the exact nature of the dark matter density spike.</description>

      <title>Science Using Single-Pulse Exploration with Combined Telescopes. I. The mode switching, flaring, and single-pulse morphology of PSR B1822-09</title>

Abstract: Aims. We aim to elucidate the pulsar radio emission by studying several single-pulse phenomena, how they relate, and how they evolve with observing frequency. We intend to inspire models for the pulsar radio emission and fast radio bursts. Methods. We set up an observing programme called the SUSPECT project running at the Nancay Radio Observatory telescopes in France (10-85 MHz, 110-240 MHz, and 1.1-3.5GHz) and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India. This first paper focuses on high sensitivity data of PSR B1822-09 obtained with the uGMRT between 550 and 750 MHz. The pulsar has precursor (PC), main pulse (MP), and interpulse (IP) emission and exhibits mode switching. We present its single-pulse stacks, investigate its mode switching using a hidden Markov switching model, and analyse its single-pulse morphology. Results. PSR B1822-09's pulse profile decomposes into seven components. We show that its mode switching is well described using a hidden Markov switching model operating on single-pulse profile features. The pulsar exhibits at least three stable emission modes, one of which is a newly discovered bright flaring Bf-mode. We confirm that the PC and MP switch synchronously to each other and both asynchronously to the IP, indicating information transfer between the polar caps. Additionally, we performed a fluctuation spectral analysis and discovered three fluctuation features in its quiescent Q-mode emission, one of which is well known. We conclude that the latter feature is due to longitude-stationary amplitude modulation. Finally, we visually classified the single pulses into four categories. We found extensive microstructure in the PC with a typical duration of 0.2-0.4 ms and a quasi-periodicity of 0.8 ms. There is clear evidence of mode mixing. We discovered low-intensity square-like pulses and extremely bright pulses in the MP, which suggest bursting.</description>

      <title>Cocoon shock breakout emission from binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shock breakout emission is among the first observable signals in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including neutron star (NS) mergers, and it can be the dominant component in low-luminosity short $\gamma$-ray bursts, as exemplified by GRB 170817A. In this work, we investigate the cocoon shock breakout emission in NS mergers and how its signal depends on the outermost layers of the ejecta profile, which we derive from general relativistic radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We study the formation of the cocoon as a consequence of a relativistic jet propagating through the ejecta. To explore the influence of the outermost layers of the ejecta on the breakout emission, we explore cases where the ejecta has a sharp cutoff or an extended smooth tail. We find that the shock breakout emission is strongly influenced by the shape of the ejecta outer layers, with extended tails yielding results consistent with the observed properties of GRB 170817A, whereas sharp cutoffs overestimate the radiated energy. Using a Bayesian analysis, we estimate the best fit parameters of the central engine, considering both accreting black hole and magnetized neutron star scenarios. Our findings indicate a slight preference for the scenarios where the engine is a black hole. Our work probes the nature of neutron star mergers and highlights the importance of the shape of the ejecta profile in modeling early electromagnetic counterparts to these mergers.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with dark matter: equiparticle model in a two fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former, we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoid the collapse of the star due to the lack of degeneracy pressure. Our results point out possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from the NASA NICER measurements of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, including the latest observational data, as well as the observed HESS J1731-347 mass-radius relationship. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.</description>

      <title>LensWatch. II. Improved Photometry and Time-delay Constraints on the Strongly Lensed Type Ia Supernova 2022qmx ("SN Zwicky") with HST Template Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently-discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky") at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point spread function (PSF) photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken $\sim 11$ months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within $2\sigma$ between lens model predicted time delays ($\lesssim1$ day), and measured time delays with HST colors ($\lesssim2$ days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about $6\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies and find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D, that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Estimation using Machine Learning and the Associated Web-App</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed at redshifts as high as 9.4, could serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases. Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods. Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for a spatial coincidence between high energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino detector and ten red dwarfs which have been observed in gamma-rays. For our analysis, we use the unbinned maximum likelihood method to look for a statistically significant excess. We do not find any such spatial association between any of the red dwarfs and Icecube-detected neutrinos. Therefore, we conclude that none of the gamma-ray bright red dwarfs contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</description>

      <title>IXPE Observation of the Low-Synchrotron Peaked Blazar S4 0954+65 During An Optical-X-ray Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray polarization observations made possible with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) offer new ways of probing high-energy emission processes in astrophysical jets from blazars. Here we report on the first X-ray polarization observation of the blazar S4 0954+65 in a high optical and X-ray state. During our multi-wavelength campaign on the source, we detected an optical flare whose peak coincided with the peak of an X-ray flare. This optical-X-ray flare most likely took place in a feature moving along the parsec-scale jet, imaged at 43 GHz by the Very Long Baseline Array. The 43 GHz polarization angle of the moving component underwent a rotation near the time of the flare. In the optical band, prior to the IXPE observation, we measured the polarization angle to be aligned with the jet axis. In contrast, during the optical flare the optical polarization angle was perpendicular to the jet axis; after the flare, it reverted to being parallel to the jet axis. Due to the smooth behavior of the optical polarization angle during the flare, we favor shocks as the main acceleration mechanism. We also infer that the ambient magnetic field lines in the jet were parallel to the jet position angle. The average degree of optical polarization during the IXPE observation was (14.3$\pm$4.1)%. Despite the flare, we only detected an upper limit of 14% (at 3$\sigma$ level) on the X-ray polarization degree; although a reasonable assumption on the X-ray polarization angle results in an upper limit of 8.8% ($3\sigma$). We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) and spectral polarization distribution (SPD) of S4 0954+65 with leptonic (synchrotron self-Compton) and hadronic (proton and pair synchrotron) models. The constraints we obtain with our combined multi-wavelength polarization observations and SED modeling tentatively disfavor hadronic models for the X-ray emission in S4 0954+65.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Intensity of the Interstellar Radiation Field with Ultra-high Energy $\gamma$ ray Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of the intensity distribution of the interstellar radiation background is based on the observational data from IRAS, COBE-FIRAS and Planck. The intensity of this radiation field increases rapidly towards the Galactic plane and is the highest near the Galactic centre due to the high density of stars and dust. However, a precise determination of the variations of this radiation field with spatial and angular coordinates is not feasible observationally. We explore how future studies of gamma-ray spectra from numerous ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources can indirectly probe variations in the interstellar radiation field's intensity across different distances from the Galactic centre and across Galactic latitudes and longitudes. This study is crucial for making self-consistent predictions of high energy gamma-ray fluxes from Galactic sources detected by observatories like LHAASO, Tibet AS$_{\gamma}$ and the next-generation gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an analysis of Insight-HXMT observations of the newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar SRGA J144459.2$-$604207. During the outburst, detected in 2024 February by SRG/ART-XC, the broadband persistent spectrum was well fitted by an absorbed Comptonization model. We detected 60 type I X-ray bursts in the Insight-HXMT medium energy (ME) data, and 37 were also detected with the low-energy (LE) telescope. By superimposing the Insight-HXMT/LE/ME/HE light curves of 37 bursts with similar profiles and intensities, we measured a deficit of X-rays in the $40-70$ keV energy band. By analyzing the time-resolved X-ray burst spectra, we determine the mean ratio of persistent to burst flux of $\alpha=71\pm7$. We estimate the average hydrogen mass fraction in the fuel at ignition, as $\bar{X} =0.342\pm0.033$, and constrain the burst fuel composition as $X_0\leq0.4$. We found that 14 out of 60 X-ray bursts exhibited photospheric expansion, and thus we estimated the distance to the source as $10.0\pm0.71$ kpc. Combined with IXPE observations, the burst recurrence time increased from 1.55 to 8 hr as the local mass accretion rate decreased, which can be described as $\Delta T_{\rm rec}\sim \dot{m}^{-0.91\pm0.02}$.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disk I: Gas-Enhanced Binary Orbital Hardening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei may contribute to gravitational wave\,(GW) events detected by grounded-based GW detectors. In particular, the interaction between a BBH and a single stellar-mass black hole\,(sBH), known as the binary-single interaction\,(BSI) process, can potentially lead to GW events with detectable non-zero eccentricity. Previous studies of the BSI process, which neglected the effects of gas, showed that BSIs contribute non-negligibly to GW events in a coplanar disk environment. In this work, we conduct a series of 2-dimensional hydrodynamical and N-body simulations to explore the BSI in a gas environment by coupling REBOUND with Athena++. We perform 360 simulation runs, spanning parameters in disk surface density \(\Sigma_0\) and impact parameter \(b\). We find that the gas-induced energy dissipation within the three-body system becomes significant if the encounter velocity between the sBHs is sufficiently large\,($\gg c_s$). Our simulation results indicate that approximately half of the end states of the BSI are changed by gas. Furthermore, at higher gas density, the number of close encounters during the BSI process will increase and the end-state BBHs tend to be more compact. Consequently, the presence of gas may shorten the GW merger timescale for end-state BBHs and increase the three-body merger rate.</description>

Abstract: The effect of the returning radiation has long been ignored in the analysis of the reflection spectra of Galactic black holes and active galactic nuclei and only recently has been implemented in the relxill package. Here we present a study on the impact of the returning radiation on the estimate of the parameters of Galactic black holes. We consider high-quality NuSTAR spectra of three Galactic black holes (GX 339-4, Swift J1658.2-4242, and MAXI J1535-571) and we fit the data with the lamppost model in the latest version of relxill, first without including the returning radiation and then including the returning radiation. We do not find any significant difference in the estimate of the parameters of these systems between the two cases, even if all three sources are fast-rotating black holes and for two sources the estimate of the height of the corona is very low, two ingredients that should maximize the effect of the returning radiation. We discuss our results and the approximations in relxill.</description>

      <title>Type I X-ray Burst Emission Reflected into the Eclipses of EXO 0748-676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutron star X-ray binary, EXO 0748--676, was observed regularly by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and XMM-Newton during its first detected outburst (1985 - 2008). These observations captured hundreds of asymmetric, energy-dependent X-ray eclipses, influenced by the ongoing ablation of the companion star and numerous Type I thermonuclear X-ray bursts. Here, we present the light curves of 22 Type I X-ray bursts observed by RXTE that coincide, fully or partially, with an X-ray eclipse. We identify nine instances where the burst occurs entirely within totality, seven bursts split across an egress, and six cases interrupted by an ingress. All in-eclipse bursts and split bursts occurred while the source was in the hard spectral state. We establish that we are not observing direct burst emission during eclipses since the companion star and the ablated outflow entirely obscure our view of the X-ray emitting region. We determine that the reflected flux from the outer accretion disc, even if maximally flared, is insufficient to explain all observations of in-eclipse X-ray bursts and instead explore scenarios whereby the emission arising from the X-ray bursts is scattered, either by a burst-induced rise in $N_{\rm{H}}$ that provides extra material, an accretion disc wind or the ablated outflow into our line of sight. However, the rarity of a burst and eclipse overlap makes it challenging to determine their origin.</description>

      <title>SN 2024iss: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Implications for a Yellow Supergiant Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the multi-band photometric observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2024iss with ultra-violet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths starting one day after the explosion. The UV and optical light curves show the first peak two days after the explosion date. Following a first peak, a secondary maximum is observed in the optical and NIR bands, similar to SNe IIb with double-peaked light curves. The quasi-bolometric light curve shows the fast decay until a week after the explosion. From the analysis of the bolometric light curve, the ejecta mass and kinetic energy are estimated to be $M_{ej}=2.8\pm0.6~M_{\odot}$ and $E_{kin}=9.4\pm4.1\times10^{50}$ erg. The mass of the radioactive $^{56}$Ni is estimated to be $M(^{56}Ni)=0.2~M_{\odot}$. Fitting a black-body function to the spectral energy distribution reveals that the photospheric temperature exhibits a rapid exponential decline during the first week after the explosion. An analytic model describing the cooling emission after shock breakout provides a reasonable explanation for the observed temperature evolution. From these ejecta parameters, we calculated the progenitor radius to be $R_{pro}=50-340$~$R_{\odot}$. We conclude that these explosion properties are consistent with a core-collapse explosion from a yellow supergiant (YSG) progenitor.</description>

      <title>Gyromagnetic Angular Momentum Interconversion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for angular momentum (AM) exchange between the crust and core of a neutron star (NS) via the gyromagnetic effect. Using extended hydrodynamics, we model the star by incorporating macroscopic AM and microscopic AM originating from neutron orbital and spin AM. We reveal that macroscopic dynamics in the crust can inform microscopic AM in the core leading to neutron spin polarization, and offer alternative scenario of (anti-)glitches. This work highlights the overlooked multi-scale AM interconversions in NS physics, paving the way for gyromagnetic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>From Young Massive Clusters to Old Globular Clusters: Density Profile Evolution and IMBH Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. In the densest YMCs, runaway stellar mergers can produce stars that collapse into IMBHs, with their final masses depending on the treatment of the giant star envelopes during collisions. If a common-envelope prescription is assumed, where the envelope is partially or entirely lost, stars form with masses up to $824\,M_{\odot}$, collapsing into IMBHs of $232\,M_{\odot}$. Alternatively, if no mass loss is assumed, stars as massive as $4000\,M_{\odot}$ can form, collapsing into IMBHs of $\sim 4000\,M_{\odot}$. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\sim$ 40%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing the ringdown signal of GW150914 using the F-statistic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from a binary black hole merger provides valuable insights into the properties of the final black hole and serves as a critical test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. A key aspect of this investigation is to determine whether the first overtone mode exists in real GW data, as its presence would offer significant implications for our understanding of general relativity under extreme conditions. To address this, we conducted a reanalysis of the ringdown signal from GW150914, using the newly proposed F-statistic method to search for the first overtone mode. Our results are consistent with those obtained through classical time-domain Bayesian inference, indicating that there is no evidence of the first overtone mode in the ringdown signal of GW150914. However, our results show the potentiality of utilizing the F-statistic methodology to unearth nuanced features within GW signals, thereby contributing novel insights into black hole properties.</description>
