      <title>Science and Project Planning for the Forward Physics Facility in Preparation for the 2024-2026 European Particle Physics Strategy Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC has opened a new window on high-energy particle physics and highlighted the potential of forward physics for groundbreaking discoveries. In the last year, the physics case for forward physics has continued to grow, and there has been extensive work on defining the Forward Physics Facility and its experiments to realize this physics potential in a timely and cost-effective manner. Following a 2-page Executive Summary, we present the status of the FPF, beginning with the FPF's unique potential to shed light on dark matter, new particles, neutrino physics, QCD, and astroparticle physics. We summarize the current designs for the Facility and its experiments, FASER2, FASER$\nu$2, FORMOSA, and FLArE, and conclude by discussing international partnerships and organization, and the FPF's schedule, budget, and technical coordination.</description>

      <title>Probing QCD Axions or Axion-like Particles in three-body $K$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-body decays like $K \to \pi a$ rank among the most constraining collider probes for new, low-mass, feebly interacting pseudoscalar particles $a$. We explore an alternative class of kaon decay modes, specifically three-body decays to $\pi \pi a$ or $\mu \mu a$. The former occur at tree level, while the latter is loop-suppressed yet accidentally finite. These modes specifically leverage the accurate tracking capabilities at LHCb. We present an estimation approach for the sensitivity achievable in future searches within these channels. Our argument uses the current uncertainty in leading irreducible backgrounds identified for each channel. Our findings suggest that dedicated searches could probe $f_a$ scales between $10^4$ and $10^6$ TeV, highlighting their strong potential. A direct comparison with actual searches, only available in the $K^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0 a$ channel, supports this conclusion. Finally, we show that, in these searches, reconstruction efficiency maps are such that large efficiencies are naturally aligned with regions of higher yields in Dalitz plots.</description>

      <title>Constraining low scale Dark Hypercharge symmetry at spallation, reactor and Dark Matter direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus (CE$\nu$NS) and Elastic Neutrino-Electron Scattering (E$\nu$ES) data are exploited to constrain "chiral" $U(1)_{X}$ gauged models with light vector mediator mass. These models fall under a distinct class of new symmetries called Dark Hypercharge Symmetries. A key feature is the fact that the $Z'$ boson can couple to all Standard Model fermions at tree level, with the $U(1)_X$ charges determined by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Notably, the charges of leptons and quarks can differ significantly depending on the specific anomaly cancellation solution. As a result, different models exhibit distinct phenomenological signatures and can be constrained through various experiments. In this work, we analyze the recent data from the COHERENT experiment, along with results from Dark Matter (DM) direct detection experiments such as XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and PandaX-4T, and place new constraints on three benchmark models. Additionally, we set constraints from a performed analysis of TEXONO data and discuss the prospects of improvement in view of the next-generation DM direct detection DARWIN experiment.</description>

      <title>Probing a $Z'$ gauge boson via neutrino trident scattering at the Forward Physics Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of neutrino physics at the Large Hadron Collider is already a reality, and a broad neutrino physics program is expected to be developed in forthcoming years at the Forward Physics Facility (FPF). In particular, the neutrino trident scattering process, which is a rare Standard Model process, is expected to be observed for the first time with a statistical significance of $5\sigma$ using the FASER$\nu$2 detector. Such a perspective motivates the investigation of the impact of New Physics on the predictions for the corresponding number of events. In this letter, we consider the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which predicts an additional massive neutral gauge boson, $Z'$, that couples to neutrino and charged leptons of the second and third families, and estimate the production of a dimuon system in the neutrino trident scattering at the FASER$\nu$2 assuming different models for the incoming neutrino flux. We derive the associated sensitivity and demonstrate that a future measurement of the dimuons produced in neutrino trident events at the FPF will extend the coverage of the parameter space in comparison to previous experiments.</description>

      <title>Lattice study on $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma\eta_c$ using a method without momentum extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model-independent method to calculate the radiative transition without the momentum extrapolation for the off-shell transition factors. The on-shell transition factor is directly obtained from the lattice hadronic function. We apply the method to calculate the charmonium radiative transition $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma\eta_c$. After a continuous extrapolation under three lattice spacings, we obtain the on-shell transition factor as $V(0)=1.90(4)$, where the error is the statistical error that already takes into account the $a^2$-error in the continuous extrapolation. Finally, we determine the branching fraction of $J/\psi\rightarrow \gamma \eta_c$ as $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow \gamma\eta_c)=2.49(11)_{\textrm{lat}}(5)_{\textrm{exp}}$, where the second error comes from the uncertainty of $J/\psi$ total decay width $92.6(1.7)$ keV.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Neon-based Gas Mixtures for Two-stage Amplification Fast-timing Micromegas Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working gas components significantly impact the performance of gaseous detectors. A fast-timing Micromegas detector with two-stage amplification is prone to notable deterioration of uniformity when scaled up. This paper presents a simulation study based on Garfield++ that aims to enhance the performance of such detectors by exploring different gas mixtures. The properties of various gas compositions and their impact on detector performance including gain uniformity and time resolution were investigated in the simulation study. The gain uniformity and single-photon time resolution of the detector were evaluated in tests using a multi-channel PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) prototype with different gas mixtures. The experimental results are consistent with the findings of the simulation. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that a higher concentration of neon improves the detector's gain uniformity, while the impact of gas mixtures on time resolution should also be considered as a critical performance indicator. The study presented in this paper offers valuable insights for improving uniformity in large-area PICOSEC MM detectors and optimizing overall performance.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first bounds on GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, showing that these bounds surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that neural networks can be used to improve search strategies, over existing strategies, in LHC searches for light electroweak-charged scalars that decay to a muon and a heavy invisible fermion. We propose a new search involving a neural network discriminator as a final cut and show that different signal regions can be defined using networks trained on different subsets of signal samples (distinguishing low-mass and high-mass regions). We also present a workflow using publicly-available analysis tools, that can lead, from background and signal simulation, to network training, through to finding projections for limits using an analysis and ${\tt ONNX}$ libraries to interface network and recasting tools. We provide an estimate of the sensitivity of our search from Run 2 LHC data, and projections for higher luminosities, showing a clear advantage over previous methods.</description>

      <title>Berry phase in axion physics: implications for detection, SM global structure, and generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-gauge-boson and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in these two systems are shown to share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase. This approach offers a new perspective on certain axion experiments, including photon birefringence and storage-ring experiments. Additionally, we conceptually propose a novel photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase provides a unique way for probing the global structure of the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the equation-of-state from low energy heavy-ion collisions within the PHQMD microscopic approach with momentum-dependent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the equation-of-state (EoS) of nuclear matter on collective observables, the directed ($v_1$) and the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of nucleons and light clusters in heavy-ion collisions at GeV beam energies employing the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) microscopic transport approach. Here the clusters are formed dynamically during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interaction between nucleons, including additionally deuteron production by hadronic kinetic reactions. We employ three different EoS - realized via potential interactions: two static EoS, dubbed 'soft' and 'hard', which differ in the compressibility modulus, as well as a soft momentum dependent EoS, adjusted to pA elastic scattering data. We find that the momentum dependent potential has different consequences for rapidity and transverse momentum spectra than for flow coefficients. We obtain the best description of the HADES and FOPI data on the directed and elliptic flow coefficients of protons and light clusters applying a momentum dependent EoS. Moreover, we observe a scaling behavior of $v_2$ versus $p_T$ with atomic number $A$. Finally we demonstrate that flow observables can help to identify the cluster production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Secondary Vertex Reconstruction with MaskFormers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy particle collisions, the reconstruction of secondary vertices from heavy-flavour hadron decays is crucial for identifying and studying jets initiated by $b$- or $c$-quarks. Traditional methods, while effective, require extensive manual optimisation and struggle to perform consistently across wide regions of phase space. Meanwhile, recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance but are unable to fully reconstruct multiple vertices. In this work we propose a novel approach to secondary vertex reconstruction based on recent advancements in object detection and computer vision. Our method directly predicts the presence and properties of an arbitrary number of vertices in a single model. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing techniques. Applied to simulated proton-proton collision events, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in vertex finding efficiency, achieving a 10% improvement over an existing state-of-the-art method. Moreover, it enables vertex fitting, providing accurate estimates of key vertex properties such as transverse momentum, radial flight distance, and angular displacement from the jet axis. When integrated into a flavour tagging pipeline, our method yields a 50% improvement in light-jet rejection and a 15% improvement in $c$-jet rejection at a $b$-jet selection efficiency of 70%. These results demonstrate the potential of adapting advanced object detection techniques for particle physics, and pave the way for more powerful and flexible reconstruction tools in high-energy physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurements of inclusive and differential cross-sections of $t\bar{t}\gamma$ production in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inclusive and differential cross-sections are measured at particle level for the associated production of a top quark pair and a photon ($t\bar{t}\gamma$). The analysis is performed using an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector. The measurements are performed in the single-lepton and dilepton top quark pair decay channels focusing on $t\bar{t}\gamma$ topologies where the photon is radiated from an initial-state parton or one of the top quarks. The absolute and normalised differential cross-sections are measured for several variables characterising the photon, lepton and jet kinematics as well as the angular separation between those objects. The observables are found to be in good agreement with the Monte Carlo predictions. The photon transverse momentum differential distribution is used to set limits on effective field theory parameters related to the electroweak dipole moments of the top quark. The combined limits using the photon and the $Z$ boson transverse momentum measured in $t\bar{t}$ production in associations with a $Z$ boson are also set.</description>

      <title>Measurement of differential ZZ + jets production cross sections in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diboson production in association with jets is studied in the fully leptonic final states, pp $\to$ (Z$\gamma^*$)(Z/$\gamma^*$) + jets $\to$ 2$\ell$2$\ell'$ + jets, ($\ell,\ell'$ = e or $\mu$) in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Differential distributions and normalized differential cross sections are measured as a function of jet multiplicity, transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}$, pseudorapidity $\eta$, invariant mass and $\Delta\eta$ of the highest-$p_\mathrm{T}$ and second-highest-$p_\mathrm{T}$ jets, and as a function of invariant mass of the four-lepton system for events with various jet multiplicities. These differential cross sections are compared with theoretical predictions that mostly agree with the experimental data. However, in a few regions we observe discrepancies between the predicted and measured values. Further improvement of the predictions is required to describe the ZZ + jets production in the whole phase space.</description>

Abstract: The first search for the lepton number violating decay $K^+\to\pi^0\pi^-\mu^+e^+$ and lepton flavour violating decays $K^+\to\pi^0\pi^+\mu^-e^+$, $K^+\to\pi^0\pi^+\mu^+e^-$ has been performed using a dataset collected by the NA62 experiment at CERN in 2016-2018. Upper limits of $2.9\times 10^{-10}$, $3.1\times 10^{-10}$ and $5.0\times 10^{-10}$, respectively, are obtained at 90% CL for the branching ratios of the three decays on the assumption of uniform phase-space distributions.</description>

      <title>Imaging Shapes of Atomic Nuclei in High-Energy Nuclear Collisions</title>

Abstract: Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometer-scale space. These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes, traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies. However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the ``collective flow assisted nuclear shape imaging'' method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analyzing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors. We benchmark this method in collisions of ground state Uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Raining on DUNE and Other Large Volume Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct detection is a powerful means of searching for particle physics evidence of dark matter (DM) heavier than about a GeV with $\mathcal O(kiloton)$ volume, low-threshold detectors. In many scenarios, some fraction of the DM may be boosted to large velocities enhancing and generally modifying possible detection signatures. We investigate the scenario where 100% of the DM is boosted at the Earth due to new attractive long-range forces. This leads to two main improvements in detection capabilities: 1) the large boost allows for detectable signatures of DM well below a GeV at large-volume neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO, as possible DM detectors, and 2) the flux at the Earth's surface is enhanced by a focusing effect. In addition, the model leads to a significant anisotropy in the signal with the DM flowing dominantly vertically at the Earth's surface instead of the typical approximately isotropic DM signal. We develop the theory behind this model and also calculate realistic constraints using a detailed GENIE simulation of the signal inside detectors.</description>

      <title>Observation of double J/$\psi$ meson production in pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first observation of the concurrent production of two J/$\psi$ mesons in proton-nucleus collisions is presented. The analysis is based on a proton-lead (pPb) data sample recorded at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 174.6 nb$^{-1}$. The two J/$\psi$ mesons are reconstructed in their $\mu^+\mu^-$ decay channels with transverse momenta $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\gt$ 6.5 GeV and rapidity $\lvert y \rvert$ $\lt$ 2.4. Events where one of the J/$\psi$ mesons is reconstructed in the dielectron channel are also considered in the search. The pPb $\to$ J/$\psi$J/$\psi$ + X process is observed with a significance of 5.3 standard deviations. The measured inclusive fiducial cross section, using the four-muon channel alone, is $\sigma$(pPb $\to$ J/$\psi$J/$\psi$ + X) = 22.0 $\pm$ 8.9 (stat) $\pm$ 1.5 (syst) nb. A fit of the data to the expected rapidity separation for pairs of J/$\psi$ mesons produced in single (SPS) and double (DPS) parton scatterings yields $\sigma^{\mathrm{pPb} \to \mathrm{J}/\psi\mathrm{J}/\psi +\mathrm{X}}_\text{SPS}$ = 16.5 $\pm$ 10.8 (stat) $\pm$ 0.1 (syst) nb and $\sigma^{\mathrm{pPb} \to \mathrm{J}/\psi\mathrm{J}/\psi + \mathrm{X}}_\text{DPS}$ = 5.4 $\pm$ 6.2 (stat) $\pm$ 0.4 (syst) nb, respectively. This latter result can be transformed into a lower bound on the effective DPS cross section, closely related to the squared average interparton transverse separation in the collision, of $\sigma_\text{eff}$ $\gt$ 1.0 mb at 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>On Extracting Thermal Parameters and Scenario in High-Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this minireview article, we examine the inconsistent results of thermal parameters derived from various models in high-energy collisions. Through a comprehensive literature review and based on the average transverse momentum or the root-mean-square transverse momentum, we propose model-independent parameters to address these inconsistencies. The relevant parameters include: the initial temperature, the effective temperature, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, and the average transverse velocity. Our findings indicate that these four parameters are larger in central collisions, within central rapidity regions, at higher energies, and in larger collision systems. As collision energy increases, excitation functions for all four parameters rise rapidly (slowly) within ranges below (above) approximately 7.7 GeV. At higher energies (&gt;39) GeV, fluctuations occur in trends for these excitation functions, with only slight changes observed in their growth rates. Additionally, this work reveals a mass-dependent multi-temperature scenario pertaining to both initial states and kinetic freeze-out processes.</description>
