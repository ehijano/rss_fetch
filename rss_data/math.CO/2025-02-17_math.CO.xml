      <title>Bernoulli Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale invariant scattering suggests that all Bernoulli numbers B_{2n} can be naturally partitioned, i.e., written as particular finite sums of same-signed, monotonic, rational numbers. Some properties of these rational numbers are discussed here, especially in the limit of large n.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable subgraphs in Ramsey graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study subgraphs that appear in large Ramsey graphs for a given graph $F$. The recent girth Ramsey theorem of the first two authors asserts that there are Ramsey graphs such that all small subgraphs are `forests of copies of $F$' amalgamated on vertices and edges. We derive a few further consequences from this structural result and investigate to which extent such forests of copies must be present in Ramsey graphs.</description>

      <title>Minimum maximal matchings in permutahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the minimal size $M(\pi_n)$ of a maximal matching in the permutahedron $\pi_n$ is asymptotically $n!/3$. On the one hand, we obtain a lower bound $M(\pi_n) \ge n! (n-1) / (3n-2)$ by considering $4$-cycles in the permutahedron. On the other hand, we obtain an asymptotical upper bound $M(\pi_n) \le n!(1/3+o(1))$ by multiple applications of Hall's theorem (similar to the approach of Forcade (1973) for the hypercube) and an exact upper bound $M(\pi_n) \le n!/3$ by an explicit construction. We also derive bounds on minimum maximal matchings in products of permutahedra.</description>

      <title>The Partition Dimension of Corona Product of Complete and Wheel Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph G is a pair of sets (V(G), E(G)), where V(G) is a finite set whose elements are called vertices, and E(G) is a set of pairs of members of V(G), which is called the edges. Let G be a simple graph. For an ordered k-partition \{\Pi\} = \{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_k\} of V(G), the representation of u with respect to \{\Pi\} is k-ordered pairs, r(u \mid \{\Pi\}) = (d(u, S_1), d(u, S_2), \dots, d(u, S_k)). The partition \{\Pi\} is called a resolving partition of G if r(u \mid \{\Pi\}) \neq r(v \mid \{\Pi\}) for all distinct u, v \in V(G). The resolving partition \{\Pi\} with the minimum cardinality is called minimum resolving partition. The partition dimension of G, denoted pd(G), is the cardinality of a minimum resolving partition of G.
  In this research, we determine the partition dimension of the corona product of a complete graph using some mathematical statements about resolving partitions, the concept of equivalent vertices, and same-level vertices. Several analysis results for the K_n \circ W_m vertices refer to equivalent vertices and the same-level vertices concept. The results show that for m = n, pd(K_n \circ W_m) = n, for n \geq 3, for m = n + 1, pd(K_n \circ W_m) = 3 for n = 3, and pd(K_n \circ W_m) = n for n \geq 3. For m = n + 2, pd(K_n \circ W_m) = 4 for n = 2, 3, and pd(K_n \circ W_m) = n for n \geq 4.</description>

      <title>On Some Algorithmic and Structural Results on Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A directed graph $F$ with a root node $r$ is called a flame if for every vertex $v$ other than $r$ the local edge-connectivity value $\lambda(r,v)$ from $r$ to $v$ is equal to $\varrho_F(v)$, the in-degree of $v$. It is a classic, simple and beautiful result of Lov\'asz that every digraph $D$ with a root node $r$ has a spanning subgraph $F$ that is a flame and the $\lambda(r,v)$ values are the same in $F$ as in $D$ for every vertex $v$ other than $r$. However, the complexity of finding the minimum weight of such a subgraph is open. In this paper we prove that this problem is solvable in strongly polynomial time for acyclic digraphs. Besides that, we prove a decomposition result of flames into a chain of smaller flames via edge-disjoint branchings and use this to prove a common generalization of Lov\'asz's above mentioned theorem and Edmonds' classic disjoint arborescences theorem.</description>

      <title>Intersection Hypergraph on D_n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $S$ be the set of all non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$. The intersection hypergraph of $G$, denoted by $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(G)$, is a hypergraph whose vertex set is $\{H \in S \,\, | \,\, H \cap K = \{e\} \,\, \text{for some} \, K \in S \}$ and hyperedges are the maximal subsets of the vertex set with the property that any two vertices in it have a trivial intersection. The aim of this paper is to study the intersection hypergraph of dihedral groups, $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. We examine some of the structural properties, viz., diameter, girth and chromatic number of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. Also, we provide characterizations for hypertreees, star structures of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$, and investigate the planarity and non-planarity of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$.</description>

      <title>Consecutive and quasi-consecutive patterns: $\mathrm{des}$-Wilf classifications and generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a correlation between the distribution of descents over permutations that avoid a consecutive pattern and those avoiding the respective quasi-consecutive pattern, as established in this paper, we obtain a complete $\des$-Wilf classification for quasi-consecutive patterns of length up to 4. For equivalence classes containing more than one pattern, we construct various descent-preserving bijections to establish the equivalences, which lead to the provision of proper versions of two incomplete bijective arguments previously published in the literature. Additionally, for two singleton classes, we derive explicit bivariate generating functions using the generalized run theorem.</description>

      <title>The radius capture number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classic cop and robber game, two players--the cop and the robber--take turns moving to a neighboring vertex or staying at their current position. The cop aims to capture the robber, while the robber tries to evade capture. A graph $G$ is called a cop-win graph if the cop can always capture the robber in a finite number of moves. In the cop and robber game with radius of capture $k$, the cop wins if he can come within distance $k$ of the robber. The radius capture number $\rc(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k$ for which the cop has a winning strategy in this variant of the game.
  In this paper, we establish that $\rc(H) \leq \rc(G)$ for any retract $H$ of $G$. We derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the radius capture number in terms of the graph's radius and girth, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the radius capture number in vertex-transitive graphs and identify several families $\cal{F}$ of vertex-transitive graphs with $\rc(G)=\rad(G)-1$ for any $G \in \cal{F}$. We further study the radius capture number in outerplanar graphs, Sierpi\'nski graphs, harmonic even graphs, and graph products. Specifically, we show that for any outerplanar graph $G$, $\rc(G)$ depends on the size of its largest inner face. For harmonic even graphs and Sierpi\'nski graphs $S(n,3)$, we prove that $\rc(G)=\rad(G)-1$. Regarding graph products, we determine exact values of the radius capture number for strong and lexicographic products, showing that they depend on the radius capture numbers of their factors. Lastly, we establish both lower and upper bounds for the radius capture number of the Cartesian product of two graphs.</description>

      <title>A Recolouring Version of a Conjecture of Reed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed conjectured that the chromatic number of any graph is closer to its clique number than to its maximum degree plus one. We consider a recolouring version of this conjecture, with respect to Kempe changes. Namely, we investigate the largest $\varepsilon$ such that all graphs $G$ are $k$-recolourable for all $k \ge \lceil \varepsilon \omega(G) + (1 -\varepsilon)(\Delta(G)+1) \rceil$. For general graphs, an existing construction of a frozen colouring shows that $\varepsilon \le 1/3$. We show that this construction is optimal in the sense that there are no frozen colourings below that threshold. For this reason, we conjecture that $\varepsilon = 1/3$. For triangle-free graphs, we give a construction of frozen colourings that shows that $\varepsilon \le 4/9$, and prove that it is also optimal. In the special case of odd-hole-free graphs, we show that $\varepsilon = 1/2$, and that this is tight up to one colour.</description>

      <title>Effective MC-finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integer sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is \emph{MC-finite} if for all $m$, the sequence $a_n \bmod m$ is eventually periodic. There are MC-finite sequences $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that the function $F: (m,n) \mapsto a_n \bmod m$ is not computable. In \cite{filmus2023mc} we presented concrete examples of MC-finite sequences taken from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) without discussing the computability of $F$. In this paper we discuss cases when this $F$ is effectively computable.</description>

      <title>Network fault costs based on minimum leaf spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fault-tolerance of networks from both the structural and computational point of view using the minimum leaf number of the corresponding graph $G$, i.e. the minimum number of leaves of the spanning trees of $G$, and its vertex-deleted subgraphs. We investigate networks that are leaf-guaranteed, i.e. which satisfy a certain stability condition with respect to minimum leaf numbers and vertex-deletion. Next to this, our main notion is the so-called fault cost, which is based on the number of vertices that have different degrees in minimum leaf spanning trees of the network and its vertex-deleted subgraphs. We characterise networks with vanishing fault cost via leaf-guaranteed graphs and describe, for any given network $N$, leaf-guaranteed networks containing $N$. We determine for all non-negative integers $k \le 8$ except $1$ the smallest network with fault cost $k$. We also give a detailed treatment of the fault cost $1$ case, prove that there are infinitely many $3$-regular networks with fault cost $3$, and show that for any non-negative integer $k$ there exists a network with fault cost exactly $k$.</description>

      <title>State transfer of Grover walks on unitary and quadratic unitary Cayley graphs over finite commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on two well-known families of Cayley graphs, namely, the unitary Cayley graphs and the quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring. The unitary Cayley graph $G_R$ has vertex set $R$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $u-v$ is a unit in $R$. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the periodicity of the Cayley graph $G_R$. We also completely determine the rings $R$ for which $G_R$ exhibits perfect state transfer. The quadratic unitary Cayley graph $\mathcal{G}_R$ has vertex set $R$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $u-v$ or $v-u$ is a square of some units in $R$. It is well known that any finite commutative ring $R$ can be expressed as $R_1\times\cdots\times R_s$, where each $R_i$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $M_i$ for $i\in\{1,...,s\}$. We characterize periodicity and perfect state transfer on $\mathcal{G}_R$ under the condition that $|R_i|/|M_i|\equiv 1 \pmod 4$ for $i\in\{1,...,s\}$. Also, we characterize periodicity and perfect state transfer on $\mathcal{G}_R$, where $R$ can be expressed as $R_0\times\cdots\times R_s$ such that $|R_0|/|M_0|\equiv3\pmod 4$, and $|R_i|/|M_i|\equiv1\pmod4$ for $i\in\{1,..., s\}$, where $R_i$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $M_i$ for $i\in\{0,...,s\}$.</description>

      <title>New infinite families of uniformly packed near-MDS codes and multiple coverings, based on the ternary Golay code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtained five new infinite families of linear near-MDS codes uniformly packed in the wide sense (UPWS); these codes are also almost perfect multiple coverings of the deep holes or farthest-off points (APMCF), i.e.\ the vectors lying at distance $R$ (covering radius) from the code. The families are constructed by $m$-lifting when one takes a starting code $C$ over the ground Galois field $F_q$ with a parity check matrix $H(C)$ and then considers the codes $C_m$ over $F_{q^m}$, $m\ge2$, with the same parity check matrix $H(C)$. As starting codes we used the ternary perfect Golay code and codes obtained by its extension and puncturing. To prove the needed combinatorial properties (UPWS and APMCF) we used the $m$-lifting of the dual codes and features of near-MDS codes. A general theorem on infinite families of UPWS near-MDS codes is proved.</description>

      <title>Totally odd immersions of complete graphs in graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The counterexamples that Catlin used to disprove Haj\'os' conjecture (that every graph $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_{\chi(G)}$) are the lexicographic product of cliques and cycles. In 1989, Lescure and Meyniel made a conjecture that is a weakening of Haj\'os' and that remains open: every graph contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. Can minimal counterexamples to this conjecture be produced through graph products? Collins, Heenehan, and McDonald recently gave a negative answer to this question for the lexicographic and Cartesian product. We consider a strengthening of the Lescure and Meyniel conjecture, different from that of Haj\'os, based on the notion of totally odd immersions. We study the largest totally odd immersion appearing in the graph product of two graphs. Our results imply that no minimal counterexample to this strengthened conjecture can be obtained from the Cartesian, lexicographic, direct (tensor) or strong product of graphs.</description>

      <title>A tropical approach to rigidity: counting realisations of frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A realisation of a graph in the plane as a bar-joint framework is rigid if there are finitely many other realisations, up to isometries, with the same edge lengths. Each of these finitely-many realisations can be seen as a solution to a system of quadratic equations prescribing the distances between pairs of points. For generic realisations, the size of the solution set depends only on the underlying graph so long as we allow for complex solutions. We provide a characterisation of the realisation number - that is the cardinality of this complex solution set - of a minimally rigid graph. Our characterisation uses tropical geometry to express the realisation number as an intersection of Bergman fans of the graphic matroid. As a consequence, we derive a combinatorial upper bound on the realisation number involving the Tutte polynomial. Moreover, we provide computational evidence that our upper bound is usually an improvement on the mixed volume bound.</description>

      <title>Pangraphs as models of higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs depict pairwise relationships between objects within a system. Higher-order interactions (HOIs), which involve more than two objects simultaneously, are common in nature. Such interactions can change the stability of a complex system. Hypergraphs can represent an HOI as an arbitrary subset of vertices. However, they fail to capture the specific roles of the vertices involved, which can be highly asymmetric, particularly in the case of interaction modifications.
  We introduce pangraphs, a robust and quantitative generalisation of graphs that accurately captures arbitrarily complex higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that several higher-order representations proposed in the literature are specific instances of pangraphs. Additionally, we introduce an incidence multilayer digraph representation of a pangraph, referred to as Levi digraph. We adapt degree and Katz centrality measures to the pangraph framework and show that a consistent generalisation of recursive graph measures cannot be simplified to a Levi digraph of a pangraph.
  We construct a pangraph for a real-world coffee agroecosystem and compare Katz centrality between its dihypergraph and pangraph representations, both analytically and numerically. The choice of representation significantly affects centrality values and alters vertex ranks. Additionally, we emphasise the use of real-valued incidence matrices to quantify interaction strengths and the roles of vertices within the system.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph removal with polynomial bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a fixed $k$-uniform hypergraph $F$, the $F$-removal lemma states that every hypergraph with few copies of $F$ can be made $F$-free by the removal of few edges. Unfortunately, for general $F$, the constants involved are given by incredibly fast-growing Ackermann-type functions. It is thus natural to ask for which $F$ one can prove removal lemmas with polynomial bounds. One trivial case where such bounds can be obtained is when $F$ is $k$-partite. Alon proved that when $k=2$ (i.e. when dealing with graphs), only bipartite graphs have a polynomial removal lemma. Kohayakawa, Nagle and R\"odl conjectured in 2002 that Alon's result can be extended to all $k&gt;2$, namely, that the only $k$-graphs $F$ for which the hypergraph removal lemma has polynomial bounds are the trivial cases when $F$ is $k$-partite. In this paper we prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Polynomial removal lemma for ordered matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every ordered matching $H$ on $t$ vertices, if an ordered $n$-vertex graph $G$ is $\varepsilon$-far from being $H$-free, then $G$ contains $\text{poly}(\varepsilon) n^t$ copies of $H$. This proves a special case of a conjecture of Tomon and the first author. We also generalize this statement to uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On the $(k+2,k)$-problem of Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os for $k=5,6,7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f^{(r)}(n;s,k)$ denote the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph containing no subgraph with $k$ edges and at most $s$ vertices. Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os [New directions in the theory of graphs (Proc. Third Ann Arbor Conf., Univ. Michigan 1971), pp. 53--63, Academic Press 1973] conjectured that the limit $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}n^{-2}f^{(3)}(n;k+2,k)$ exists for all $k$. The value of the limit was previously determined for $k=2$ in the original paper of Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os, for $k=3$ by Glock [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 51 (2019) 230--236] and for $k=4$ by Glock, Joos, Kim, K\"uhn, Lichev and Pikhurko [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., Series B, 11 (2024) 173-186] while Delcourt and Postle [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 152 (2024), 1881-1891] proved the conjecture (without determining the limiting value).
  In this paper, we determine the value of the limit in the Brown-Erd\H{o}s-S\'os Problem for $k\in \{5,6,7\}$. More generally, we obtain the value of $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}n^{-2}f^{(r)}(n;rk-2k+2,k)$ for all $r\geq 3$ and $k\in \{5,6,7\}$. In addition, by combining these new values with recent results of Bennett, Cushman and Dudek [arXiv:2309.00182] we obtain new asymptotic values for several generalised Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>The general position number under vertex and edge removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\rm gp}(G)$ be the general position number of a graph $G$. It is proved that ${\rm gp}(G-x)\leq 2{\rm gp}(G)$ holds for any vertex $x$ of a connected graph $G$ and that if $x$ lies in some ${\rm gp}$-set of $G$, then ${\rm gp}(G) - 1 \le {\rm gp}(G-x)$. Constructions are given which show that ${\rm gp}(G-x)$ can be much larger than ${\rm gp}(G)$ also when $G-x$ is connected. For diameter $2$ graphs it is proved that ${\rm gp}(G-x) \le {\rm gp}(G)$, and that ${\rm gp}(G-x) \ge {\rm gp}(G) - 1$ when the diameter of $G-x$ remains $2$. It is demonstrated that ${\rm gp}(G)/2\le {\rm gp}(G-e)\leq 2{\rm gp}(G)$ holds for any edge $e$ of a graph $G$. For diameter $2$ graphs these results can be improved to ${\rm gp}(G)-1\le {\rm gp}(G-e)\leq\ {\rm gp}(G) + 1$. All these bounds are proved to be sharp.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we extend results about unique $n^{\textrm{th}}$ roots and cancellation of finite disconnected graphs with respect to the Cartesian, the strong and the direct product, to the rooted hierarchical products, and to a modified lexicographic product. We show that these results also hold for graphs with countably many finite connected components, as long as every connected component appears only finitely often (up to isomorphism). The proofs are via monoid algebras and generalized power series rings.</description>

      <title>Generalized central sets theorem for partial semigroups and vip systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Central sets theorem was first introduced by H. Furstenberg
  [F] in terms of Dynamical systems. Later Hindman and Bergelson extended
  the theorem using Stone-$\v{C}$ech compactification $\beta$$\mathbb{N}$ of $\mathbb{N}$. In [SY] algebraic
  characterization of Central sets was done for semigroup and equivalence of
  Dynamical and Algebraic characterizations were shown. D. De, N. Hindman,
  and D. Strauss proved a stronger version of the Central sets theorem for semigroup. D. Phulara generalized that theorem for commutative semigroup taking
  a sequence of Central sets. Recently J. Podder and S. Pal established the
  Phulara type generalization of Central sets theorem near zero [PP]. We did
  this for arbitrary adequate partial semigroup and VIP systems.</description>

      <title>Equatorial Flow Triangulations of Gorenstein Flow Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing work of Athanasiadis for the Birkhoff polytope and Reiner and Welker for order polytopes, in 2007 Bruns and R\"omer proved that any Gorenstein lattice polytope with a regular unimodular triangulation admits a regular unimodular triangulation that is the join of a special simplex with a triangulated sphere. These are sometimes referred to as equatorial triangulations. We apply these techniques to give purely combinatorial descriptions of previously-unstudied triangulations of Gorensten flow polytopes. Further, we prove that the resulting equatorial flow polytope triangulations are usually distinct from the family of triangulations obtained by Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy via framings. We find the facet description of the reflexive polytope obtained by projecting a Gorenstein flow polytope along a special simplex. Finally, we show that when a partially ordered set is strongly planar, equatorial triangulations of a related flow polytope can be used to produce new unimodular triangulations of the corresponding order polytope.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the $k$-isolation number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isolation number of a graph $G$ (also called the vertex-edge domination number of $G$), denoted by $\iota(G)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set $V(G)$ of $G$ such that $G-N[D]$ (the graph obtained by deleting the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ from $G$) has no edges. For $k \geq 1$, the $k$-isolation number of $G$ is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of $V(G)$ such that the maximum degree of $G-N[D]$ is at most $k-1$. Thus, $\iota_1(G) = \iota(G)$. Let $n$ and $\ell$ be the number of vertices and the number of leaves of $G$, respectively. We show that if $n \geq 3$ and $G$ is connected, then $\iota_k(G) \leq \frac{n - \ell}{2}$. We also show that if $G$ is a tree $T$, then $\iota(T) \leq \frac{n + \ell}{4}$ and $\iota_k(T) \leq \frac{n + \ell}{2k+1}$ for $k \geq 2$. These bounds together improve the inequality $\iota_k(T) \leq \frac{n}{k+2}$ of Caro and Hansberg except that their inequality is better if $k \geq 2$ and $\frac{k-1}{k+2}n &lt; \ell &lt; \frac{k}{k+2}n$. Each of the new bounds is attainable if it is an integer. For each of them, we characterize all the graphs that attain it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a series of W-type differential operators, which appear naturally in the symmetry algebras of KP and BKP hierarchies. In particular, they include all operators in the W-constraints for tau functions of higher KdV hierarchies which satisfy the string equation. We will give simple uniform formulas for actions of these operators on all ordinary Schur functions and Schur's Q-functions. As applications of such formulas, we will give new simple proofs for Alexandrov's conjecture and Mironov-Morozov's formula, which express the Br\'{e}zin-Gross-Witten and Kontsevich-Witten tau-functions as linear combinations of Q-functions with simple coefficients respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study $2$-designs with $\lambda=2$ admitting a flag-transitive almost simple automorphism group with socle a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type, and we prove that such a $2$-design does not exist. In conclusion, we present a classification of $2$-designs with $\lambda=2$ admitting flag-transitive and point-primitive automorphism groups of almost simple type, which states that such a $2$-design belongs to an infinite family of $2$-designs with parameter set $((3^n-1)/2,3,2)$ and $X=PSL_n(3)$ for some $n\geq 3$, or it is isomorphic to the $2$-design with parameter set $(6,3,2)$, $(7,4,2)$, $(10,4,2)$, $(10,4,2)$, $(11,5,2)$, $(28,7,2)$, $(28,3,2)$, $(36,6,2)$, $(126,6,2)$ or $(176,8,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, a variation of the cop number, is an invariant suitable for infinite graphs and is a quasi-isometric invariant. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist locally finite infinite graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists locally finite vertex transitive graphs whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We test this question on Cayley graphs of wreath products, these are objects known for their exotic geometries. We prove that Cayley graphs of wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. The result is proved by defining a new pursuit and evasion game and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. We also include a short argument that Cayley graphs of Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak cop number.</description>

      <title>The Moran process on a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fixation probability for two versions of the Moran process on the random graph $G_{n,p}$ at the threshold for connectivity. The Moran process models the spread of a mutant population in a network. Throughtout the process there are vertices of two types, mutants and non-mutants. Mutants have fitness $s$ and non-mutants have fitness 1. The process starts with a unique individual mutant located at the vertex $v_0$. In the Birth-Death version of the process a random vertex is chosen proportional to its fitness and then changes the type of a random neighbor to its own. The process continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. In the Death-Birth version a uniform random vertex is chosen and then takes the type of a random neighbor, chosen according to fitness. The process again continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. The {\em fixation probability} is the probability that the process ends with $X=\emptyset$.
  We give asymptotically correct estimates of the fixation probability that depend on degree of $v_0$ and its neighbors.,</description>

      <title>Representation theory over semifields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study and classify representations of a torsion group $G$ over an idempotent semifield with special attention on the case over the Boolean semifield $\mathbb{B}$. In subsequent work we extend this theory to studying representations of matroids of low rank.</description>
