      <title>$\nu$ limits from Super-Kamiokande on dark matter-electron scattering in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle dark matter scattering on electrons in the Sun may gravitationally capture and self-annihilate inside it to neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, or other final states that in turn decay to them. Using up-to-date measurements by Super-Kamiokande of the fluxes of atmospheric electron-type and muon-type neutrinos, we set the most stringent limits on the electron scattering cross sections of dark matter down to about $10^{-40}-10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ over a mass range of 4$-$200 GeV. These outdo direct searches for dark matter-electron scattering and previously set limits at IceCube. We also derive corresponding reaches at Hyper-K, and show that atmospheric neutrino observations restricted to the direction of the Sun can improve sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter via Charged Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter direct-detection strategy using charged particle decays at accelerator-based experiments. If ultralight $(m_\phi \ll \text{eV})$ dark matter has a misalignment abundance, its local field oscillates in time at a frequency set by its mass. If it also couples to flavor-changing neutral currents, rare exotic decays such as $\mu \to e \phi$ and $\tau\to e(\mu)\phi$ inherit this modulation. Focusing on such charged lepton flavor-violating decays, we show that sufficient event samples can enable detection of ultralight dark matter candidates at Mu3e, Belle-II, and FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Analytic results for electroweak precision observables at NLO in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytic results for electroweak precision observables (EWPO) at next-to-leading order (NLO) in dimension-six SMEFT, with no assumptions on the flavour structure of SMEFT Wilson coefficients. The results are given in five different electroweak input schemes, thus offering a simple means, along with scale variations, of estimating theory uncertainties related to higher-order terms in the SMEFT expansion. Our results will be useful to assess the constraining power of existing and future lepton colliders for new physics scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses and mixing: Entering the era of subpercent precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an updated global analysis of the known and unknown parameters of the standard $3\nu$ framework as of 2025. The known oscillation parameters include three mixing angles $(\theta_{12},\,\theta_{23},\,\theta_{13})$ and two squared mass gaps, chosen as $\delta m^2=m^2_2-m^2_1&gt;0$ and $\Delta m^2=m^2_3-{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(m^2_1+m^2_2)$, where $\alpha=\mathrm{sign}(\Delta m^2)$ distinguishes normal ordering (NO, $\alpha=+1$) from inverted ordering (IO, $\alpha=-1$). With respect to our previous 2021 update, the combination of oscillation data leads to appreciably reduced uncertainties for $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ and $|\Delta m^2|$. In particular, $|\Delta m^2|$ is the first $3\nu$ parameter to enter the domain of subpercent precision (0.8\% at $1\sigma$). We underline some issues about systematics, that might affect this error estimate. Concerning oscillation unknowns, we find a relatively weak preference for NO versus IO (at $2.2\sigma$), for CP violation versus conservation in NO (1.3$\sigma$) and for the first $\theta_{23}$ octant versus the second in NO ($1.1\sigma$). We discuss the status and qualitative prospects of the mass ordering hint in the plane $(\delta m^2,\,\Delta m^2_{ee})$, where $\Delta m^2_{ee}=|\Delta m^2|+{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\alpha(\cos^2\theta_{12}-\sin^2\theta_{12})\delta m^2$, to be measured by the JUNO experiment with subpercent precision. We also discuss upper bounds on nonoscillation observables. We report $m_\beta&lt;0.50$~eV and $m_{\beta\beta}&lt;0.086$~eV ($2\sigma$). Concerning the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma$, we discuss representative combinations of data, with or without augmenting the $\Lambda$CDM model with extra parameters accounting for possible systematics or new physics. The resulting $2\sigma$ upper limits are roughly spread around the bound $\Sigma &lt; 0.2$~eV within a factor of three. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Explaining the KM3-230213A Detection without Gamma-Ray Emission: Cosmic-Ray Dark Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a high-energy neutrino event, designated KM3-230213A, was observed by the KM3NeT/ARCA detector in the Mediterranean Sea. This event is characterized by a reconstructed muon energy of approximately 120 PeV, corresponding to a median neutrino energy of roughly 220 PeV. To understand the origin, it is essential to investigate consistency with multi-messenger observations--particularly gamma-ray constraints--in various theoretical scenarios within and beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by this, we explore the possibility that the detected event does not originate from conventional neutrinos but rather from right-handed neutrinos (sterile neutrinos) mixing with active neutrinos, leading to the observed muon signal. Such cosmic-ray dark radiation may have originated either in the early Universe or through dark matter decay in the present epoch. We show that in both cases, while satisfying existing general constraints on light sterile neutrinos, the stringent multi-messenger gamma-ray limits can be significantly alleviated. A distinct prediction of this scenario is that such events can arrive from directions through Earth that would typically attenuate conventional neutrinos. A related scenario involving cosmic-ray boosted WIMP dark matter is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Brief History of Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known since the 1950's that an unstable particle is associated with a complex pole in the propagator. This had to be rediscovered twice: in the early 1970's in the context of hadronic resonances, and in the early 1990's in the context of the $Z$ boson. The physical mass of the particle is the real part of the pole in the complex energy plane. In hadronic physics, this replaced the ``Breit-Wigner mass,'' which was found to depend on the parameterization of the ``energy-dependent width.'' In $Z$ physics, it replaced the ``on-shell'' mass, which was found to be gauge dependent. Although the mass defined from the complex pole position has been widely discussed in the literature, it has not yet made its way into quantum field theory textbooks.</description>

      <title>The Pierre Auger Observatory and Physics Beyond the Standard Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest cosmic ray detector, plays a pivotal role in exploring the frontiers of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. By the observation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, Auger provides critical insights into two major scenarios: super heavy dark matter and Lorentz invariance violation. Super heavy dark matter, hypothesized to originate in the early universe, offers a compelling explanation for the dark matter problem and is constrained by Auger through searches for photons and neutrinos resulting from its decay. Lorentz invariance violations, motivated by quantum gravity theories implying deviations from fundamental symmetries, are probed by Auger through alterations of the particle dispersion relation and the energy thresholds of their interactions with astrophysical photons backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Discriminative versus Generative Approaches to Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the fundamental, emergent, and phenomenological parameters of particle and nuclear physics are determined through parametric template fits. Simulations are used to populate histograms which are then matched to data. This approach is inherently lossy, since histograms are binned and low-dimensional. Deep learning has enabled unbinned and high-dimensional parameter estimation through neural likelihiood(-ratio) estimation. We compare two approaches for neural simulation-based inference (NSBI): one based on discriminative learning (classification) and one based on generative modeling. These two approaches are directly evaluated on the same datasets, with a similar level of hyperparameter optimization in both cases. In addition to a Gaussian dataset, we study NSBI using a Higgs boson dataset from the FAIR Universe Challenge. We find that both the direct likelihood and likelihood ratio estimation are able to effectively extract parameters with reasonable uncertainties. For the numerical examples and within the set of hyperparameters studied, we found that the likelihood ratio method is more accurate and/or precise. Both methods have a significant spread from the network training and would require ensembling or other mitigation strategies in practice.</description>

      <title>Constraints on new vector boson mediated electron-nucleus interactions from spectroscopy of polar diatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A measurement of parity violation in the hyperfine structure of $^{138}$Ba$^{19}$F [E. Altunta\c{s} et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 142501 (2018)] is reinterpreted with density functional theory calculations in terms of beyond Standard Model vector boson mediated electron-nucleus interactions. Our results set constraints on previously unexplored, new boson mediated axial vector-vector nucleus-electron interactions. Similar bounds are obtained by analyzing the atomic parity violation experiment with $^{133}$Cs. Moreover, we show that future experiments with cold heavy diatomic molecules like $^{225}$RaF will improve on the present sensitivity to axial vector-vector nucleon-nucleus interactions by at least four orders of magnitudes assuming current experimental resolution.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Matrix with broken Scaling in light of LMA and Dark-LMA Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we have investigated some patterns of broken ``scaling" ansatz of the neutrino mass matrix. The scaling neutrino mass matrix is disallowed by the current neutrino oscillation data as, among others, it predicts vanishing reactor angle ($\theta_{13}=0$). We study its possible breaking scenarios in light of the large mixing angle (LMA) and Dark-LMA solutions suggested by current neutrino oscillation data. The normal hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum is ruled out in all three possible breaking patterns. Also, one of the interesting features of these breaking scenarios is the interplay between $\theta_{23}$-octant and possible CP violation. We find that the model allows maximal CP violation for $\theta_{23}$ above $6\%$ of its maximal value which, interestingly, is close to its current best-fit value for inverted hierarchical neutrino masses. We have, also, investigated the implications for effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter $|M_{ee}|$ for allowed breaking patterns. The correlation behavior of Majorana CP phases, which can be probed in $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments, is found to have the capability of distinguishing LMA and Dark-LMA solutions.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Drell-Yan process by an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongest electromagnetic fields in nature are created in high energy nuclear collisions and expected to change the dynamic scattering processes in the early stage. The magnetic field effect on the Drell-Yan process is investigated in this work. The single photon decay into quark pairs and lepton pairs in an external magnetic field leads to a significant Drell-Yan suppression in low and intermediate invariant mass region. The calculation up to the Landau level $n-1$ is complete in the energy region $s&lt;2/3n(eB)$, and the enlarged phase space at higher landau levels may enhance the dilepton spectrum in the high mass region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the help of a semi-classical kinetic theory, a new collision kernel is proposed, which simultaneously conserves the energy-momentum tensor and the spin tensor of a relativistic fluid of spin-1/2 particles irrespective of the frame and matching conditions, even when relaxation time is momentum dependent. The relativistic Boltzmann's equation is solved using this new collision kernel to obtain the expressions of the transport coefficients with general definitions for the frame and matching conditions. The results indicate the expected existence of Barnett-like effect and the non-existence of Einstein--de-Haas-like effects.</description>

      <title>Superkick Effect in Vortex Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex states of photons or electrons are a novel and promising experimental tool across atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Various experimental schemes to generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed. However, diagnosing the characteristics of vortex states at high energies remains a significant challenge, as traditional low-energy detection schemes become impractical for high-energy vortex particles due to their extremely short de Broglie wavelength. We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme based on a mechanism called "superkick" that is free from many drawbacks of the traditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this paper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the superkick effect in elastic electron scattering and systematically investigate the impact of various factors on its visibility. In particular, we argue that the vortex phase can be identified either by detecting the two scattered electrons in coincidence or by analyzing the characteristic azimuthal asymmetry in individual final particles.</description>

      <title>Testing the dark origin of neutrino masses with oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown to date. One popular idea involves interactions between neutrinos and ultralight dark matter, described as fields or particles with masses $m_\phi \ll 10\,\mathrm{eV}$. Due to the large phase-space number density, this type of dark matter exists in coherent states and can be effectively described by an oscillating classical field. As a result, neutrino mass-squared differences undergo field-induced interference in spacetime, potentially generating detectable effects in oscillation experiments. We demonstrate that if $m_\phi\gg 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the mechanism becomes sensitive to dark matter density fluctuations, which suppresses the oscillatory behavior of flavor-changing probabilities as a function of neutrino propagation distance in a model-independent way, thereby ruling out this regime. Furthermore, by analyzing data from the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND), a benchmark long-baseline reactor experiment, we show that the hypothesis of a dark origin for the neutrino masses is disfavored for $m_\phi \ll 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, compared to the case of constant mass values in vacuum. This result holds at more than the 4$\sigma$ level across different datasets and parameter choices. The mass range $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$ can be further tested in current and future oscillation experiments by searching for time variations (rather than periodicity) in oscillation parameters.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P_{\psi}^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ within the Bethe-Salpeter framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining the effective Lagrangian and Bethe-Salpeter framework, we studied the mass spectra, wave functions, and strong decay widths of the two pentaquark states $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ reported by LHCb in 2019. We calculate the one-boson-exchange interaction kernel of $\bar D^*\Sigma_c$ in the isospin-$\frac12$ configuration. Then we present the Bethe-Salpeter equation(BSE) and wave functions for the bound states of a vector meson and a $\frac12$ baryon with $J^P={\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$. By solving the BSE we obtain 2 bound states for both ${\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$ spin-parity configuration, and the mass results favor the $(\frac32)^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ configuration for the $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$. Combining the effective Lagrangians and the obtained BS wave functions, we further calculate the strong decay channels $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$, $J/\psi(\eta_c) p$, and $\bar D\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ for the two $P_\psi^N$ states. In the favored $\frac32^-$ and $\frac12^-$ configuration, the obtained total widths are 34.8 MeV and $2.2$ MeV for $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$, respectively, which are substantially consistent with the LHCb data. The obtained decay widths suggest that $\bar D^{*0}\Lambda_c^+$ and $\bar D\Sigma_c$ are the dominant decay channels to detect $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$. Taking into account both the mass spectra and decay widths, our results favor the interpretation of $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$ as the isospin-$\frac12$ $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ molecular states with $J^P$ configuration $(\frac{3}{2})^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Investigating the broadening phenomenon in two-particle correlations induced by gluon saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been found that the gluon density inside the proton grows rapidly at small momentum fractions. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that this growth can be regulated by nonlinear effects, ultimately leading to gluon saturation. Within the color glass condensate framework, nonlinear QCD effects are predicted to suppress and broaden back-to-back angular correlations in collisions involving heavy nuclei. While suppression has been observed in various experiments in $d/p$$+$A collisions compared to $p$$+$$p$ collisions, the predicted broadening remains unobserved. This study investigates the contributions of intrinsic transverse momentum ($k_T$), which is associated with saturation physics, as well as parton showers and transverse motion from fragmentation ($p_T^{\mathrm{frag}}$), which are not saturation dependent, to the width of the correlation function. Our findings show that the non-saturation dependent effects, especially the initial-state parton shower and $p_T^{\mathrm{frag}}$, which occur independently of the collision system, smear the back-to-back correlation more than gluon saturation does, making the broadening phenomenon difficult to observe.</description>

      <title>Light-by-Light scattering in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions: Estimating inelastic contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art theoretical estimations lead to cross-sections for $AA \to \gamma \gamma AA$ which are somewhat smaller than the measured ones by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, which motivates the searching and calculation of subleading corrections disregarded in these previous studies. In this paper, we estimate the contribution of inelastic channels to the Light - by - Light (LbL) scattering in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions (UPHICs), in which one or both of the incident nuclei dissociate ($A A \to \gamma \gamma X Y$ where $X, Y = A, A'$) due to the photon emission. These new mechanisms are related to extra emissions that are rather difficult to identify at the LHC and can be mistakenly interpreted as enhanced $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ scattering compared to the Standard Model result. We include processes of coupling of photons to individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) in addition to coherent coupling to the whole nuclei (called standard approach here). Both elastic (nucleon in the ground state) and inelastic (nucleon in an excited state) in the couplings of photons to nucleons are taken into account. The inelastic nucleon fluxes are calculated using CT18qed photon in nucleon PDFs. The inelastic photon fluxes are shown and compared to standard photon fluxes in the nucleus. In addition, we show the ratio of the inelastic corrections to the standard contribution as a function of diphoton invariant mass and photon rapidity difference. We find the maximal effect of the inelastic corrections at $M_{\gamma \gamma} \sim$ 14 GeV for the ATLAS rapidity and transverse momentum acceptance. Furthermore, the inelastic contribution increases gradually with photon rapidity difference. Our results indicate that the inelastic contributions can increase locally by 10-15 \% the traditional (no nuclear excitation) predictions for the LbL scattering in UPCs.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenlike molecules composed of $D_1D_1$, $D_1D^*_2$ and $D^*_2D^*_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically explore the S-wave $D_1D_1$, $D_1D^*_2$ and $D^*_2D^*_2$ states with various isospin-spin-orbit ($ISL$) configurations in the quark model. We propose nine stable dimeson states with the $ISL$ configurations, $ISL=001$, $010$, $012$, $100$, $102$, $110$, $112$, $120$, and $122$, against dissociation into their constituent mesons. Those bound states are hydrogenlike molecular states, where the two subclusters are moderately overlapped and the QCD covalent bond is formed due to the delocalization of light quarks. The QCD covalent bond serves as the primary binding mechanism in the bound states with $I=1$. However, the exchange of $\pi$ and $\sigma$-meson plays a pivotal role in the bound states with $I=0$. The coupled-channel effect is essential in the formation of the bound states with $ISL=001$, $010$, $012$, $100$, and $102$.</description>

      <title>On new physics off the Z peak in $H \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a small but intriguing excess observed in the decay mode $ H\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- \gamma$ reported by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, we explore the possibility that new physics contributes directly to the effective $ H \ell \overline{\ell} \gamma $ coupling rather than modifying the $ Z $ peak. Concretely, we consider a dimension-8 operator that could arise from new particles via box diagrams. Such non-resonant contribution may provide an alternative origin for current or future excesses. We examine how experimental cuts may distinguish between possible modifications of the $ Z $ peak and non-resonant contributions. The currently measured excess requires that the new physics scale is relatively low $( \Lambda_R \sim v $). However, we show that it may remain within current experimental bounds. In particular, we illustrate this using a simplified model, motivated by the dark matter problem, and discuss its other experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavored meson spectrum under the action of external magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Schr{\"o}dinger equation in a magnetic field is utilized to study the effect of the magnetic field on $B$ mesons. The mass spetrum of $B$ mesons are numerically calculated for different magnetic field strengths by solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation under the non-relativistic Cornell potential model, incorporating the Zeeman effect and the harmonic oscillator basis vector expansion method. The external magnetic field is assumed to be sufficiently strong in the calculations, so that the spin-orbit interaction energies can be omitted in comparison with the energies induced by the field. The Zeeman term in the Schr{\"o}dinger equation is taken to be $ \frac{eB_s}{2m_ec}(m\pm1)$ where $m=0, \pm1$. The results demonstrate Zeeman splitting of energy levels in the external magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than a decade ago, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered a diffuse flux of 10 TeV - 10 PeV neutrinos from our Universe. This flux of unknown origin most likely emanates from an extragalactic population of neutrino sources, which are individually too faint to appear as bright emitters. We review constraints on extragalactic neutrino source populations based on the non-detection of the brightest neutrino source. Extending previous work, we discuss limitations of source populations based on general neutrino luminosity functions. Our method provides more conservative but also statistically more robust predictions for the expected number of observable sources. We also show that the combined search of the brightest neutrino sources via weighted stacking searches or the analysis of non-Poissonian fluctuations in event-count histograms can improve the discovery potential by a factor of 2-3 relative to the brightest source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After obtaining the flavor $D6$-brane gauge fields/their fluctuations in the type IIA dual of T&gt;T_c QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling (via the ${\cal M}$-theory uplift's ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections) in the absence/presence of a strong magnetic field, we compute the photoproduction spectral function and get a nice agreement with gauged supergravity backgrounds arXiv:2204.00024 [hep-th]. We demonstrate from the EoS that the holographic dual, in principle, could correspond to several $T&gt;T_c$ scenarios: stable wormhole, stable wormhole transitioning via a smooth crossover to dark energy as the universe cools, and a paramagnetic pressure/energy-anisotropic plasma. Given that $T&gt;T_c$ QGP is expected to be paramagnetic, see Bali et al '14, the third possibility appears to be the preferred one. We also show that it is not possible that the anisotropic plasma leads to the formation of a compact star. IR renormalization of the DBI action requires a boundary Log-det-Ricci-tensor counter term. {\it Noting (i) photoproduction spectral function, speed of sound, etc. determined from gauge field fluctuations receiving ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrections, if complexified, include a non-analytic-complexified gauge-coupling dependence, and correspond to Contact 3-Structures; (ii) pressure/energy density, etc. determined from world-volume gauge fields and not ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected, if complexified, are analytic in the complexified gauge coupling, and correspond to Almost Contact 3-Structures (AC3S) both induced from the $G_2$ structure of a closed seven-fold, we conjecture (i) the lack of $N$-path connectedness in the parameter space associated with AC3S and C3S arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th] to be equivalent to that gauge field fluctuations can not be finite, and (zero-instanton sector) ${\cal O}(R^4)$ non-renormalized gauge fields produce ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected gauge fluctuation; (ii) C3S--UV--&gt; AC3S.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Cosmic Neutrino Background Capture on Astrophysical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic background are captured by objects in the sky that contain material susceptible of single beta decay. Neutrons, which compose most of a neutron star, capture low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic neutrino background and release a high-energy electron in the MeV range. Also, planets contain unstable isotopes that capture the cosmic neutrinos. We show that this process is feasible and results in a non-negligible flux of electrons in the MeV range in neutron stars. We present a novel observable, the redshift evolution of the temperature of neutron stars due to neutrino capture, that could provide a route for detection of the cosmic neutrino background from future gravitational waves observatories. For planets the flux is significantly smaller and a measurement is not possible with currently envisioned technology. While the signature from neutron stars is small and challenging, it could result in a novel way to detect the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

Abstract: We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 18 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we extrapolate the value of this contribution to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of the black hole photon ring as a probe of ultralight dilaton fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have facilitated unprecedented probing of superradiant phenomena in the vicinities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), establishing an ideal laboratory to detect ultralight bosons beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we delve into how ultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the form $f(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing simulations covering a range of plasma densities and dilaton coupling strengths, we reveal a periodic distortion in the photon ring morphology, with the periodicity aligning with that of the dilaton-driven plasma frequency oscillations. We then assess the magnitude of this effect under the current angular resolution constraints of VLBI observations. Our analysis indicates that a comprehensive search for superradiant dilaton clouds based on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling would necessitate radio interferometric baselines significantly exceeding the Earth's diameter to resolve the corresponding signatures.</description>

      <title>On the Interference between Meson Exchange and One-Body Currents in Quasielastic Electron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the interference between meson exchange currents (MEC) and one-body currents in quasielastic electron scattering, with a focus on the sign of this interference in the transverse response for one-particle emission. We prove that the interference of both the Delta and pion-in-flight currents with the one-body current is negative, leading to a partial cancellation with the seagull current. This is mathematically demonstrated within the framework of the Fermi gas model. By comparing these interferences across various independent particle models, both relativistic and non-relativistic, our results indicate that all studied models display the same behavior. This consistency suggests that the interference is negative in models that do not incorporate tensor correlations in the nuclear wave function.</description>

      <title>Density matrices in quantum field theory: Non-Markovianity, path integrals and master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density matrices are powerful mathematical tools for the description of closed and open quantum systems. Recently, methods for the direct computation of density matrix elements in scalar quantum field theory were developed based on thermo field dynamics (TFD) and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this article, we provide a more detailed discussion of these methods and derive expressions for density matrix elements of closed and open systems. At first, we look at closed systems by discussing general solutions to the Schr\"odinger-like form of the quantum Liouville equations in TFD, showing that the dynamical map is indeed divisible, deriving a path integral-based expression for the density matrix elements in Fock space, and explaining why perturbation theory enables us to use the last even in situations where all initial states in Fock space are occupied. Subsequently, we discuss open systems in the same manner after tracing out environmental degrees of freedom from the solutions for closed systems. We find that, even in a general basis, the dynamical map is not divisible, which renders the dynamics of open systems non-Markovian. Finally, we show how the resulting expressions for open systems can be used to obtain quantum master equations, and comment on the artificiality of time integrals over density matrices that usually appear in many other master equations in the literature but are absent in ours.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</description>

      <title>Comments on Compton forward scattering singularity in the NCQED</title>

Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of head-to-head high energy Compton scattering in the $\theta$-exact noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the Moyal space (NCQED) in the amid its unresolved forward scattering singularity. We model the effect of the currently unknown resolution to this unavoidable collinear singularity by cut-offs which are functions of the control variable $s/\Lambda_{\rm NC}^2$, and find that such cut-off functions can suppress NC corrections to the inverse Compton scattering to negligible. Discussed cut-offs leave the unpolarised integral cross section of the forward region larger than the backward region all the time, making the former potentially easier to observe. Our estimations indicate that such an effect may be visible in the future collider experiments when the NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\gtrsim1$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Production of the heavy-flavour decay lepton in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study on the production of the heavy-flavour decay lepton (HFL) in high-energy nuclear collisions at the LHC. The pp-baseline is calculated by the FONLL program, which matches the next-to-leading order pQCD calculation with the next-to-leading-log large-$p_T$ resummation. The in-medium propagation of heavy quarks is driven by the modified Langevin equations, which consider both the elastic and inelastic partonic interactions. We propose a method to separate the respective influence of the six factors, such as pp-spectra, the cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, in-medium energy loss (E-loss), fragmentation functions (FFs), coalescence (Coal), and decay channels, which may contribute to the larger $R_{AA}$ of HFL $\leftarrow b$ compared to that of HFL $\leftarrow c$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Based on quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that both coalescence hadronization, decay channels and the mass-dependent E-loss play an essential role at $p_T&lt;5$ GeV, while the latter dominates the higher $p_T$ region. It is also found that the influences of the CNM effects and FFs are insignificant. At the same time, different initial pp-spectra of charm and bottom quarks have a considerable impact at $p_T&gt;5$ GeV. Furthermore, we explore the path-length dependence of jet quenching by comparing the HFL $R_{AA}$ in two different collision systems. Our investigations show smaller HFL $R_{AA}$ in Pb+Pb than in Xe+Xe within the same centrality bin, consistent with the ALICE data. The longer propagation time and more effective energy loss of heavy quarks in Pb+Pb collisions play critical roles in the stronger yield suppression of the HFL compared to that in Xe+Xe. In addition, we observe a scaling behavior of the HFL $R_{AA}$ in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of the quark-meson model with omega and rho vector mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The functional renormalization group (FRG) is a non-perturbative method that considers quantum and thermal fluctuations. Using the FRG flow equations, the critical region of the two-flavor quark-meson model in a finite isospin chemical potential with omega and rho vector mesons interactions is investigated in this work. We also use the traditional mean-field method to calculate the phase diagram in the chiral limit for comparison. The results show that the influences of the omega meson and rho meson on the phase structure are quite different. The existence of the isospin chemical potential also causes significant changes in the phase structure.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of (multi)strange hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$ TeV using EPOS4 and AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is anticipated that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collect data from oxygen-oxygen ($O+O$) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV to explore the effects observed in high multiplicity proton-proton ($p+p$) and proton-lead ($p+pb$) collisions that closely related to lead-lead ($Pb+Pb$) collisions. These effects include azimuthal asymmetries in particle production, as well as variations in the abundances and momentum distributions across different hadron species, which are indicative of collective particle production mechanisms induced by the interactions in the presence of a QGP. The upcoming data on $O+O$ collisions at the LHC are expected to constrain the model parameters and refine our understanding of theoretical models. In this work, the predicted transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$), particle yield ratios, and $p_T$-differential ratios of (multi)strange hadrons produced in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV using AMPT and EPOS4 models are presented. AMPT focuses on preformed hadronic interactions, while EPOS4 incorporates a QGP phase. Stronger radial flow in EPOS4 as compared to AMPT is also observed. AMPT incorporates some flow effects, but the implementation of full hydrodynamic flow in EPOS4 appears to be significantly more effective in reproducing the existing experimental data. Both models predict the final state multiplicity overlap with $p+p$, $p+pb$, and $Pb+Pb$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Classification of Coupled-Channel Near-Threshold Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since 2003, plenty of resonant structures have been observed in the heavy quarkonium regime. Many of them are close to the thresholds of a few pairs of heavy hadrons. They are candidates of exotic hadrons and have attracted immense attentions. Based on a coupled-channel nonrelativistic effective field theory, we classify the near-threshold structures of a symmetry-related two-channel system by studying the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes and pole positions with the variation of the single-channel scattering length and channel coupling strength. We show that the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes can be understood from the pole trajectories in the complex energy plane, and the pole evolution can be traced back to the renormalization group fixed points. We provide a dictionary of correspondence between the evolution of line shapes and pole trajectories along with varying interaction and channel coupling strengths, which can be used to understand the experimental observations of the near-threshold structures.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation of electroweak scale from the conformal sector: A strongly coupled Higgs via the Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel pathway to generate the electroweak (EW) scale via non-perturbative dynamics of a conformally invariant scalar sector at the classical level. We provide a method to estimate the non-perturbative EW scale generation using the exact solution of the background equations of motion in a scalar theory via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an analytical result for the Higgs mass in the strongly coupled regime in terms of its quartic self interaction term and the cut-off scale of the theory. We also show that the Higgs sector is an essential part of the Standard Model as, without it, a Yang--Mills gauge theory cannot acquire mass even if a self-interaction term is present. Our analysis lead to a more realistic model building with possible solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and, in general, to the dynamical generation of any scales scales in nature, be it the visible sector or the dark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the stress within a strongly coupled scalar nucleon, and now dissect the gravitational form factors into contributions from its constituents, the (mock) nucleon and the (mock) pion. The computation is based on a non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa model in the light-front Hamiltonian formalism with a Fock sector expansion including up to one nucleon and two pions. By employing the ``good currents" $T^{++}_i$, $T^{+-}_i$ and $T^{12}_i$, we extract the full set of gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$, $\bar c_i$ without the contamination of the spurious form factors, and free of uncanceled UV divergences. With these results, we decompose the mass of the system into its constituents and compute the matter and mechanical radii, gaining insights into the strongly coupled system.</description>

      <title>Muon collider probes of Majorana neutrino dipole moments and masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana neutrinos may have transitional dipole moments, which violate lepton number as well as lepton flavour. We estimate the sensitivity of future colliders to the electron-muon neutrino dipole moment, $\lambda_{e\mu}$, by considering same-sign dilepton final states. We find that hadron colliders, even the proposed FCC-hh, are sensitive only to $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\gtrsim 10^{-9}\mu_B$ (with $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton), a value two-three orders of magnitude larger than current bounds from astrophysics and low-energy neutrino-scattering experiments. In the case of a future muon collider, we show that the sensitivity varies from $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\sim 5\cdot 10^{-9}\mu_B$ for energy $\sqrt{s}\simeq 3$ TeV, to $\sim 10^{-12}\mu_B$ for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 50$ TeV, matching the current laboratory bounds for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 30$ TeV. The singular advantage of the muon collider signal would be a direct, clean identification of lepton number and flavour violation. We also show that a muon collider would improve by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on $m_{e\mu}$ and $m_{\mu\mu}$, two of the entries of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix. These bounds could be as strong as $\sim 50$ keV, still far above the neutrino mass scale.</description>

      <title>Monojets from compressed weak frustrated dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the so-called hyperchargeless Higgs triplet model to include a weak triplet of Dirac fermions and a Dirac fermion $X$ transforming trivially under the Standard Model gauge group. We are motivated in part by a collection of anomalies that can be interpreted as a new scalar state with mass of approximately 152 GeV coupling to $W$ but not $Z$ bosons, which may be consistent with the electrically neutral triplet scalar in this model (provided that it mixes very slightly with the Standard Model Higgs boson). Meanwhile, the lightest neutral fermion in the model is stable and can be thermal dark matter with the correct relic abundance if it mixes lightly with the neutral triplet fermion, such that the dark matter is composed mostly of $X$. Because $X$ couples to the Standard Model only through a Yukawa-like interaction with the pair of triplets, this model falls into the frustrated dark matter paradigm. Finally, the spectrum of exotic fermions in this model can exhibit the strong compression favored by the current excess in the monojet channel, and evades multijet constraints in the region favored by monojets. In this work we explore this model's phenomenology and compare the parameter space regions best suited to each of the aforementioned excesses and constraints.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are employed to solve the Dyson--Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Euclidean space, with a focus on the non-perturbative generation of the fermion's dynamical mass function in the Landau gauge. By inserting the integral equation directly into the loss function, our PINN framework enables a single neural network to learn a continuous and differentiable representation of the mass function over a spectrum of momenta. Also, we benchmark our approach against a traditional numerical algorithm showing the main differences among them. Our novel strategy, which can be extended to other quantum field theories, paves the way for forefront applications of machine learning in high-level theoretical physics.</description>

Abstract: In an intermediate-momentum regime where mass effects are significant, heavy quark suppression and anisotropic flow are computed to investigate the transition between the collisional and radiative energy loss. Based on the collision kernel for diffusion, elastic scattering and semi-collinear gluon-bremsstrahlung can be consistently incorporated into a Boltzmann equation that involves the heavy quark diffusion coefficient. Using the running coupling constant and the diffusion coefficient constrained by lattice QCD data, the collisional and radiative energy-loss contributions to the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ are studied in hydrodynamically expanding thermal media. The evolution of the observables, the bulk flow effect, and the dependence on mass and centrality are discussed in noncentral heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble, and use event generators to study their decay and subsequent evolution of the decay products to obtain the spectrum of emitted photons and neutrinos as a long-range signature. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlators (EECs) within high energy jets serve as a key experimentally accessible quantity to probe the scale and structure of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The CMS Collaboration's first measurement of the modification to the EEC within single inclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions reveals a significant enhancement at small angles, which may arise from jet transverse momentum $p_T$ selection biases due to jet energy loss. We investigate the dependence of jet EECs on the flavor of the initiating parton. The EEC distribution of a gluon jet is broader and the peak of transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regime occurs at a larger angle than a quark jet. Such flavor dependence leads to the different EECs for $\gamma$-jets and single inclusive jets due to their different flavor composition. It is also responsible for a colliding energy dependence of EECs of single inclusive jets at fixed jet energy. We also investigate the impact of flavor composition variation on the $p_T$ dependence of the jet EEC. We further propose that a change in the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions compared to p+p can also contribute to a non-negligible enhancement of the medium modified EEC at small angles. Using the \textsc{Jewel} model, we predict the reduction of the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions and estimate its impact on the EEC.</description>

      <title>Filtered cogenesis of PBH dark matter and baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in the Universe by utilising a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the dark sector containing an asymmetric Dirac fermion $\chi$. Due to the mass difference of $\chi$ across the bubble walls, it is energetically favourable for $\chi$ to get trapped in the false vacuum leading to the formation of Fermi-ball, which can self-collapse to form primordial black hole (PBH) if $\chi$ has a sufficiently large Yukawa interaction. While such PBH formed out of false vacuum collapse can give rise to the DM in the Universe, a tiny amount of asymmetric $\chi$ leaking into the true vacuum through the bubble walls can transfer the dark asymmetry into the visible sector via decay. The same mass difference of $\chi$ across the two minima which decides the amount of trapping or filtering of $\chi$, also allows $\chi$ decay into visible sector in the true minima while keeping it stable in the false vacuum.

      <title>Single pion resonant production in BSM scenarios: cross sections and amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework describing single pion resonant production through inelastic dark fermion-nucleon interactions mediated by resonances in the GeV-scale regime. Building upon the Rein-Sehgal approach, we derive differential cross sections for processes in which an incoming dark fermion scatters off a nucleon, exciting a resonance that subsequently decays into a nucleon and a pion. Our formulation accommodates various mediator types-namely, dark photons with vector and axial couplings, as well as scalar and pseudoscalar mediators-thereby extending the conventional approach that Rein, Sehgal and Berger performed for neutrino interactions. Transition amplitudes for the nucleon-to-resonance conversion are computed using the relativistic harmonic-oscillator quark model from Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal, while a Breit-Wigner prescription is employed to incorporate finite resonance widths. This framework offers a robust tool for interpreting experimental data in dark sector and matter searches and represents a contribution to elucidate the role of resonances in GeV-scale phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that measurements of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at spallation sources are valuable probes of muon-decay physics. Using COHERENT data we derive the first direct constraint on the Michel parameters governing the $\bar\nu_\mu$ energy distribution. We also discuss future sensitivities and assess the implications for the Lorentz structure of the interactions mediating muon decay.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis with perturbations in type-II and type-III seesaw models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density perturbations have recently been shown to lead to a novel effect in the freeze-out of heavy particles called "acoustically driven freeze-out." This leads to an enhancement in the yield in standard leptogenesis. We extend this calculation to include $2 \to 2$ washout processes in type-I leptogenesis and the Sommerfeld-enhanced $2 \to 2$ gauge annihilations in type-II and type-III leptogenesis. These CP conserving gauge annihilations suppress the yield of heavy particles sourcing the asymmetry. We show the acoustically driven freeze-out leads to novel enhancements in the baryon asymmetry in type-II and type-III leptogenesis, already in the weak washout regime, in contrast with type-I leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Reduced Hubble Tension in Dark Radiation Models after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, contributing to the effective number of neutrinos $N_\text{eff}$, as $\Delta N_\text{eff}\equiv N_\text{eff}-3.044\geq 0$, in light of the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the DESI collaboration. We analyze one-parameter extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model where dark radiation (DR) is free streaming or behaves as a perfect fluid, due to self-interactions. We report a significant relaxation of upper bounds on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, with respect to previous BAO data from SDSS+6dFGS, when additionally employing Planck data (and supernovae data from Pantheon+), setting $\Delta N_\text{eff}\leq 0.39$ ($95\%$ C.L.) for free streaming DR, and a very mild preference for fluid DR, $\Delta N_\text{eff} = 0.221^{+0.088}_{-0.18}$ ($\leq 0.46$, $95\%$ C.L.). Applying constraints from primordial element abundances leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, but they are avoided if DR is produced after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For fluid DR we estimate the tension with the SH$_0$ES determination of $H_0$ to be less than $3\sigma$ and as low as $2\sigma$, and for free-streaming DR the tension is below $3\sigma$ if production occurs after BBN. This lesser degree of tension motivates a combination with SH$_0$ES in these cases, resulting in a $4.4\sigma-5\sigma$ evidence for dark radiation with $\Delta N_\text{eff}\simeq 0.6$ and large improvements in $\chi^2$ over $\Lambda$CDM, $-18\lesssim \Delta \chi^2\lesssim -25$. Upcoming data releases by DESI and other CMB and LSS surveys will decisively confirm or disfavour this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with dark matter: equiparticle model in a two fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former, we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoid the collapse of the star due to the lack of degeneracy pressure. Our results point out possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from the NASA NICER measurements of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, including the latest observational data, as well as the observed HESS J1731-347 mass-radius relationship. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.</description>

      <title>Methodology for constraining ultralight vector bosons with gravitational wave searches targeting merger remnant black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons are a hypothetical class of particles predicted under various extensions of Standard Model physics. As a result of the superradiance mechanism, we expect ultralight bosons, should they exist in certain mass ranges, to form macroscopic clouds around rotating black holes, so that we can probe their existence by looking for the long-transient gravitational wave emission produced by such clouds. In this paper, we propose a statistically robust framework for constraining the existence of ultralight vector bosons in the absence of detecting such a signal from searches targeting merger remnant black holes, effectively marginalizing over the uncertainties present in the properties of the target black holes. We also determine the impact of weak kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon and vector mass generation through a hidden Higgs mechanism on the constraining power of these searches. We find that individual follow-up searches, particularly with the next-generation gravitational wave detectors, can probe regions of parameter space for such models where robust constraints are still lacking.</description>

      <title>Data taking strategy for $\psi(3770)$ and $\Upsilon(4S)$ branching fraction measurements at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\psi(3770)$ and $\Upsilon(4S)$ states predominantly decay into open-flavor meson pairs, whereas the decays of $\psi(3770) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}D\bar{D}$ and $\Upsilon(4S) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}B\bar{B}$ are rare but crucial for elucidating the inner structure and decay dynamics of heavy quarkonium states. To achieve precise branching fraction measurements for $\psi(3770) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}D\bar{D}$ and $\Upsilon(4S) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}B\bar{B}$ decays at the high luminosity $e^+e^-$ annihilation experiments, we employed Monte Carlo simulations and Fisher information to evaluate various data taking scenarios, ultimately determining the optimal scheme. The consistent results of both methodologies indicate that the optimal energy points for studies of $\psi(3770) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}D\bar{D}$ decays are $3.769~\gev$ and $3.781~\gev$, whereas those for $\Upsilon(4S) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}B\bar{B}$ decays are $10.574~\gev$ and $10.585~\gev$. In addition, we studied the dependence of the precision in branching fraction measurements on the integrated luminosity, with the branching fractions spanning several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>
