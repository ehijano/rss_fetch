      <title>The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses.</description>

      <title>In-medium similarity renormalization group for a pairing-plus-particle-hole model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We benchmark two implementations of the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) method, IMSRG(2) and IMSRG(2*), for the low-lying states of a pairing-plus-particle-hole model with varying numbers of fermions. In IMSRG(2), all operators are truncated up to the normal-ordered two-body terms, whereas IMSRG(2*) includes an additional term to partially account for higher-body contributions. The results are compared against exact solutions. We find that IMSRG(2*) consistently outperforms IMSRG(2) for both ground and excited states, although achieving convergence for excited states remains more challenging in strongly correlated systems than for the ground state.</description>

      <title>Impact of shape coexistence on the symmetric to asymmetric fission mode transition in Th isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of fission modes along the Th isotopic chain using a microscopic framework combining the time-dependent generator coordinate method and finite-temperature covariant density functional theory. Theoretical fission fragment charge distributions agree well with experiments, and reveal a rapid symmetric-to-asymmetric transition from $A=222$ to 234. By analyzing the free energy surfaces and time evolution of collective probability density distributions, we demonstrate that this fission mode transition is strongly correlated with the rapidly deepening asymmetric fission valley $-$ a phenomenon driven by the reduction of deformation energies of both the heavy and light fragments formed in the asymmetric fission valley. Further analysis attributes the decrease of light-fragment deformation energies to the onset of a coexisting large-deformed minimum in neutron-rich Kr and Sr isotopes (dominated isotopes for light asymmetric peak), which arises from a deformed proton $Z=38$ shell closure near $\beta_2\approx0.46$. Notably, we identify, for the first time, the pivotal role of the light fragment and its shape coexistence structure on the fission mode transition in Th isotopes in a fully microscopic framework.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Curvature as a Probe of Exotic Core Phases in Neutron Stars within Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) on the curvature of neutron stars (NSs) by using three relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) and three hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) EOSs. Neutron stars, with their extreme densities and strong gravitational fields, provide an ideal laboratory for testing General Relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime and for exploring possible deviations via modified gravity. EMSG extends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor, characterized by a coupling parameter $\alpha$. We focus on the Kretschmann, Ricci, and Weyl curvature scalars, analyzing their dependence on baryon density and radial coordinate for varying values of $\alpha$. Our results indicate that EMSG can significantly alter the curvature profiles of neutron stars. In particular, the magnitude of both Weyl and Kretschmann scalars increases (decreases) for a positive (negative) EMSG parameter, with the former exhibiting a larger dependence. Similarly, the surface curvature (SC) is notably affected by $\alpha$. Interestingly, we further observe distinct discontinuities in the curvature profiles at hadron-quark phase transitions, especially in the soft and intermediate HQPT models. These signatures may provide observable imprints of exotic core phases in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Nucleon energy correlators as a probe of light-quark dipole operators at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose nucleon energy correlators (NECs) as a novel framework to probe electroweak light-quark dipole operators in deep inelastic scattering with an unpolarized nucleon. These operators encode chirality-flipping interactions, whose effects are usually quadratically suppressed in unpolarized cross sections. We construct a chiral-odd quark NEC that accesses quark transverse spin via azimuthal angle asymmetries in the energy flow of the target fragmentation region. These asymmetries serve as clean and powerful observables, enabling linear constraints on the quark dipole couplings. Unlike existing methods, our approach requires neither polarized nucleon beams nor final-state hadron identification, relying instead on fully inclusive calorimetric measurements. This work establishes one of the first applications of energy correlator observables to new physics searches and opens a promising direction for precision studies of chirality-flipping effects at electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>On the High Excitation 7$\alpha$ De-exciting States in $^{28}$Si$^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct comparison and analysis of published spectra for the 7$\alpha$ disassembly of $^{28}$Si projectiles excited in collisions with $^{12}$C at 35 MeV/u reveals striking agreement in the derived excitation energies of high excitation energy resonances observed in two different experiments, in contrast to some earlier conclusions reported in the literature. Many of the observed resonances have excitation energies consistent with those arrived at in recent theoretical investigations explicitly predicting the excitation energies and spins of toroidal nuclei. Some additional peaks are observed and the possibility that they correspond to other favored geometries is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium in a QCD medium with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the properties of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium using a newly proposed collision kernel that consistently incorporates the particle's momentum dependence into the relaxation time scale of the medium. The longitudinal component of the gluon self-energy, along with the Debye screening mass, is computed within the one-loop hard thermal loop framework by incorporating non-equilibrium corrections. A modified kinetic theory with an extended relaxation time approximation is employed to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of the QCD medium. The sensitivity of the heavy quarkonia potential to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is studied. Further, we studied the binding energy and thermal width of quarkonia states within this new kinetic theory. Sizable variations in the temperature behavior of these quantities are observed in comparison with the standard relaxation time approximation method due to the particle momentum dependence on the relaxation timescale of the QCD medium. Our findings highlight that accounting for the microscopic nature of the collision timescale is crucial for understanding the quarkonium behavior in a QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Proper effective temperature and order parameters in relativistic non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their connection with the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs). The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\pi \eta $ and $\eta \eta^{\prime}$. In this work, we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit and express the extracted $M_1M_2$ GDAs in terms of meson distribution amplitudes that have been constrained by the previous experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF that violates the conservation law of EMT when the hadronic matrix element of the EMT operator is considered separately for each quark flavor. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs in the perturbative limit. In the future, the GDAs and the EMT FFs studied in this paper can be probed at Belle II. Our study enhances the accessibility to the $P$-wave GDAs in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, and provides a promising approach for searching for exotic hybrid mesons in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>
