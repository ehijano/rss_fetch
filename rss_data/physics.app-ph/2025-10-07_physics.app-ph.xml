      <title>Seal Whisker-Inspired Sensor for Amplifying Wake-Induced Vibrations in Underwater Marine Animal Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater marine animal monitoring is essential for assessing biodiversity, evaluating ecosystem health, and understanding the effects of offshore structures. Traditional approaches such as tagging, sonar, and camera systems are often invasive, energy-intensive, or limited by poor visibility and water turbidity. Inspired by the hydrodynamic sensing of seal whiskers, wavy whisker vibration sensors have been developed for flow velocity and angle-of-attack detection. However, most prior work has focused on sensor characterization and only forward modeling, with limited exploration of the inverse problem of inferring animal movement. Moreover, current sensor sensitivity to vortex street wakes generated by swimming animals remains insufficient for practical monitoring. To address this gap, we develop a whisker-inspired sensor with a spiral-perforated base that amplifies vibrations within frequency ranges relevant to animal-induced wakes. We further characterize the influence of spiral parameters on the sensitive frequency band, enabling adaptation of the design to specific species. We evaluated the amplification effect of the spiral-perforated design using frequency response simulations of the whisker-base structure under harmonic water pressure. Results show up to 51x enhancement in root mean squared displacement at the target sensor location within frequency bands associated with animal-induced wakes compared to the baseline design, confirming the effectiveness of the amplification.</description>

      <title>Agile manoeuvring of dandelion-inspired micro-flyers with vortex-enabled stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manoeuvring untethered, centimetre-scale airborne structures has been a long-standing challenge. Active flight systems, relying on high-power-density actuators alongside mechanical and electronic components, are constrained by critical limitations in energy delivery and miniaturisation. In contrast, passive systems transported and distributed by the wind typically lack the capability for mid-air controlled manoeuvrability. Here we report an ultra-light (1.2 mg) hexagonal polymeric assembly capable of passive flight with optical control of its trajectory. This dandelion-inspired micro-flyer incorporates six radially arranged filamentous structures, of which morphology is dynamically controlled through photomechanical deformation by six independent soft actuators made of liquid crystalline elastomer thin films. Compared to the diaspore of the dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), micro-flyer demonstrate a similar terminal velocity (~0.5 m s-1), 45% better positional stability and nearly zero rotational rate (1.68 s-1; natural seeds: 50.8 s-1). Particle image velocimetry reveals that a stable asymmetric separated vortex ring underlies its flight stability, enabling mid-air steerability. When free-falling in a low-turbulent airstream, the light-driven hexapodal fliers demonstrate precise altitude control, reversible body flipping, pattern formation, interactive swarm, and controlled trajectories across three-dimensional space. The results show that responsive materials with light-induced asymmetry can bring about manoeuvrability in air, paving the way for agile, untethered controlled micro-fliers.</description>

      <title>Surface Acoustic Wave Gas Sensors: Innovations in Functional Materials, Sensing Dynamics, and Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface Acoustic Wave gas sensors have garnered increasing attention as highly sensitive, miniaturized, and wireless compatible platforms for molecular detection. Their unique ability to convert surface perturbations into measurable acoustic shifts makes them ideal for gas sensing across diverse environments. This review synthesizes reported SAW platforms across substrates and modes Rayleigh, SH-SAW, Love links transduction pathways to material choice, and benchmarks performance for key analytes, e.g., NO2, NH3, VOCs, CO2, etc. We catalogue nanostructured oxides, polymers, carbon based films, and hybrid heterojunction coatings, highlighting attributes such as porosity, surface chemistry, and interfacial charge transfer that govern sensitivity and reversibility. We also highlight the emerging use of SAW devices to probe adsorption desorption dynamics, offering analyte specific interaction signatures beyond equilibrium, offering a new perspective into analyte specific interaction pathways. Additionally, the integration of machine learning is discussed as a transformative tool for signal decoding, environmental compensation, and adaptive calibration. We also identify key challenges, cross sensitivity, signal drift, material degradation, and deployment at the edge and review recent strategies to address them. Looking ahead, we envision the evolution of SAW platforms into intelligent, autonomous sensing systems with applications in environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnonic spintronic system for tunable broadband signal filtering and microwave generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-conventional beyond-the-state-of-the-art signal processing schemes require parallelism, scalability, robustness and energy efficiency to meet the demands of complex data-driven applications. With further research, magnonic and spintronic circuits can potentially help to fulfill these requirements. We present an experimental proof-of-concept of a hybrid device that can employ broad deteriorated microwave signals to excite and detect low energy propagating spin waves (SWs). For this, we use the output signal of a spin-transfer torque nano-oscillator (STNO) and connect it to a RF filter based on a magnonic delay-line. The STNO serves as a tunable nano-scaled signal generator with a broad output linewidth. Its RF output is fed as input into the magnonic delay-line circuit. Tuning the magnetic field solely at the magnonic circuit, we demonstrate the capability to selectively filter a broad RF input, obtaining a spin-wave output signal with a much narrower linewidth. This allows to tune the frequency of the RF signal at the output simply by tuning the magnetic field. Our findings are a first step towards a versatile, energy-efficient and compact wave-based filter with high sensitivity. Such a device can use even low-power, degraded signals and convert them into tunable SW outputs, effectively reducing the need for charge-based signal processing.</description>

      <title>Electron-beam-induced Contactless Manipulation of Interlayer Twist in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to dynamically control the relative orientation of layers in two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures represents a critical step toward the realization of reconfigurable nanoscale devices. Existing actuation methods often rely on mechanical contact, complex architectures, or extreme operating conditions, which limit their applicability and scalability. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of contactless electrostatic actuation based on electron-beam-induced charge injection. By locally charging an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on an electrically grounded graphene layer, we create an interfacial electric field that generates in-plane electrostatic torque and induces angular displacement. We validate the induced rotation through in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>High Cycle S-N curve prediction for Al 7075-T6 alloy using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal swimming with body compliance in an overdamped medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elongate animals and robots use undulatory body waves to locomote through diverse environments. Geometric mechanics provides a framework to model and optimize such systems in highly damped environments, connecting a prescribed shape change pattern (gait) with locomotion displacement. However, existing approaches assume precise execution of prescribed gaits, whereas in practice environmental interactions with compliant bodies of animals or robots frequently perturb the realized trajectories. In this work, we extend geometric mechanics to predict locomotor performance and search for optimal swimming strategy of compliant undulators. We introduce a compliant extension of Purcell's three-link swimmer by incorporating series-connected springs at the joints. Body dynamics are derived with resistive force theory. Geometric mechanics is incorporated into movement prediction and into an optimization framework that identifies strategies for controlling compliant swimmers to achieve maximal displacement. We validate our framework on a physical cable-driven three-link limbless robot, and demonstrate accurate prediction and optimization of locomotor performance under varied programmed, state-dependent compliance in a granular medium. Our results establish a systematic physics-based approach for modeling and controlling compliant swimming locomotion, highlighting compliance as a design feature that can be exploited for robust movement in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Based Dual-Basis Polarization Beam Splitter for efficient entanglement witnessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement witnessing is essential for quantum technologies such as computing, key distribution, and networking. Conventional bulk-optics methods require sequential reconfiguration across multiple polarization bases, limiting efficiency and scalability. We propose a metasurface-based analyzer that performs dual-basis (\sigma_z and \sigma_y) projections simultaneously by mapping them to orthogonal spatial modes. This allows direct access to the commuting two-photon correlators \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle and \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle required for entanglement witnessing. The metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent linear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control, resulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L components. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to sequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for chip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward efficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution image projection over an extended depth of field using a diffractive decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image projection systems must be efficient in data storage, computation and transmission while maintaining a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP) at their output. Here, we introduce a hybrid image projection system that achieves extended depth-of-field (DOF) with improved resolution, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based digital encoder with an all-optical diffractive decoder. A CNN-based encoder compresses input images into compact phase representations, which are subsequently displayed by a low-resolution (LR) projector and processed by an analog diffractive decoder for all-optical image reconstruction. This optical decoder is completely passive, designed to synthesize pixel super-resolved image projections that feature an extended DOF while eliminating the need for additional power consumption for super-resolved image reconstruction. Our pixel super-resolution (PSR) image projection system demonstrates high-fidelity image synthesis over an extended DOF of ~267xW, where W is the illumination wavelength, concurrently offering up to ~16-fold SBP improvement at each lateral plane. The proof of concept of this approach is validated through an experiment conducted in the THz spectrum, and the system is scalable across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This image projection architecture can reduce data storage and transmission requirements for display systems without imposing additional power constraints on the optical decoder. Beyond extended DOF PSR image projection, the underlying principles of this approach can be extended to various applications, including optical metrology and microscopy.</description>

      <title>A van der Waals material exhibiting room temperature broken inversion symmetry with ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the initial synthesis of van der Waals two-dimensional indium selenide was first documented in 1957, five distinct polymorphs and their corresponding polytypes have been identified. In this study, we report a unique phase of indium selenide via Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis in the synthesized large-area films -- which we have named the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase. The quintuple layers of the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase, characterized by a unique zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths from the middle selenium atom, are distinct from any other previously reported phase of indium selenide. Cross-sectional STEM analysis has revealed that the $\beta^\text{p}$ layers exhibit intralayer shifting. We found that indium selenide films with $\beta^\text{p}$ layers display electric-field-induced switchable polarization characteristic of ferroelectric materials, suggesting the breaking of the inversion symmetry. Experimental observations of nonlinear optical phenomena -- Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses further support this conclusion. This study reports a $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide showing ferroelectricity over large areas at room temperature in a low-dimensional limit.</description>

Abstract: In this study, binary $ZnSe:Fe^{2+}$ crystals and ternary $Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}Se:Fe^{2+}$ crystals $(0 &lt; x &lt; 0.6)$ were grown by the vertical Bridgman method in graphite crucibles under high argon pressure. A comparative characterization of the structural, energetic, and optical parameters of the obtained crystals was performed. Theoretical explanations of the observed experimental characteristics, including the specific red-shift of the absorption and emission spectra with increasing solid-solution concentration, are provided. These results could be useful for the development of new laser media based on simple and complex AIIBVI crystals and for targeted engineering of their optical properties.</description>

Abstract: Single-electron detectors are a key component of electron microscopes and advanced electron optics experiments. We present a YAG:Ce scintillator-based single-electron detector with a spatial resolution of 1 micrometer at an electron energy of 17 keV. Single-electron detection events are identified with an efficiency and purity larger than 0.8 at an electron energy of 17 keV, reaching 0.96 at 30 keV. We show that the detector enables electron diffraction studies with a sample-detector distance comparable to the mean free path of electrons at atmospheric pressure, potentially enabling atmospheric electron diffraction studies.</description>

      <title>Tamm Plasmon-Enhanced Widely Tunable Near-Infrared Nanolaser with Superior Efficiency and Output Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04827v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic resonances attract significant interest due to their ability to tightly confine electromagnetic fields. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are widely used in plasmonic nanolasers, but performance is often affected by coupling into reflective and transmissive directions and multiple far-field modes, mainly due to higher-order diffraction from the plasmonic crystal. Here, we utilize the Tamm plasmon mode at the interface between a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and a metal layer to achieve lasing in the NIR region with wide tunability. Optical Tamm states are excited at the metal-DBR interface by a pump pulse, and emission is enhanced via extraordinary optical transmission through a metallic nanohole array, which suppresses higher-order diffraction and ensures a directional far-field pattern. A second DBR beneath the pump side further suppresses backward emission and enhances forward lasing intensity. The combination of Tamm plasmon excitation and dual-DBR feedback improves cavity response and overall lasing efficiency. This approach provides a cost-effective and versatile route to plasmonic nanolasers with enhanced efficiency, tunability, and integration potential for next-generation on-chip photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced the "Virtual VNA" concept which estimates the $N \times N$ scattering matrix characterizing an arbitrarily complex linear reciprocal system with $N$ monomodal lumped ports by inputting and outputting waves only via $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while terminating the $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ remaining ports with known tunable individual loads. However, vexing ambiguities about the signs of the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports remained. If only phase-insensitive measurements were used, an additional blockwise phase ambiguity ensued. Here, inspired by the emergence of "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" in wireless communications, we lift all ambiguities with at most $N_\mathrm{S}$ additional measurements involving a known multi-port load network. We experimentally validate our approach based on an 8-port chaotic cavity, using a simple coaxial cable as two-port load network. Endowed with the multi-port load network, the "Virtual VNA 2.0" is now able to estimate the entire scattering matrix without any ambiguity, even without ever measuring phase information explicitly. Potential applications include the challenging characterization of large and/or embedded antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric truss metamaterials: data-driven design and additive manufacturing</title>

Abstract: In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis and simulation of lateral memristive devices: Schottky, ohmic, and multi-dimensional electrode models</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the numerical analysis and simulations of a multi-dimensional memristive device model. Memristive devices and memtransistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have demonstrated promising potential for neuromorphic computing and next-generation memory technologies. Our charge transport model describes the drift-diffusion of electrons, holes, and ionic defects self-consistently in an electric field. We incorporate two types of boundary models: ohmic and Schottky contacts. The coupled drift-diffusion partial differential equations are discretized using a physics-preserving Voronoi finite volume method. It relies on an implicit time-stepping scheme and the excess chemical potential flux approximation. We demonstrate that the fully discrete nonlinear scheme is unconditionally stable, preserving the free-energy structure of the continuous system and ensuring the non-negativity of carrier densities. Novel discrete entropy-dissipation inequalities for both boundary condition types in multiple dimensions allow us to prove the existence of discrete solutions. We perform multi-dimensional simulations to understand the impact of electrode configurations and device geometries, focusing on the hysteresis behavior in lateral 2D memristive devices. Three electrode configurations -- side, top, and mixed contacts -- are compared numerically for different geometries and boundary conditions. These simulations reveal the conditions under which a simplified one-dimensional electrode geometry can well represent the three electrode configurations. This work lays the foundations for developing accurate, efficient simulation tools for 2D memristive devices and memtransistors, offering tools and guidelines for their design and optimization in future applications.</description>
