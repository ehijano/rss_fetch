      <title>Minkowski weak embedding theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of Assouad states that metric spaces satisfying the doubling property can be snowflaked and bi-Lipschitz embedded into Euclidean spaces. Due to the invariance of many geometric properties under bi-Lipschitz maps, this result greatly facilitates the study of such spaces. We prove a non-injective analog of this embedding theorem for spaces of finite Minkowski dimension. This allows for non-doubling spaces to be weakly embedded and studied in the usual Euclidean setting. Such spaces often arise in the context of random geometry and mathematical physics with the Brownian continuum tree and Liouville quantum gravity metrics being prominent examples.</description>

      <title>Generalized Voronoi Diagrams and Lie Sphere Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Lie sphere geometry to describe two large categories of generalized Voronoi diagrams that can be encoded in terms of the Lie quadric, the Lie inner product, and polyhedra. The first class consists of diagrams defined in terms of extremal spheres in the space of Lie spheres, and the second class includes minimization diagrams for functions that can be expressed in terms of affine functions on a higher-dimensional space. These results unify and generalize previous descriptions of generalized Voronoi diagrams as convex hull problems. Special cases include classical Voronoi diagrams, power diagrams, order $k$ and farthest point diagrams, Apollonius diagrams, medial axes, and generalized Voronoi diagrams whose sites are combinations of points, spheres and half-spaces. We describe the application of these results to algorithms for computing generalized Voronoi diagrams and find the complexity of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>

      <title>Topological and Dynamic Properties of the Sublinearly Morse Boundary and the Quasi-Redirecting Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sublinearly Morse boundaries of proper geodesic spaces are introduced by Qing, Rafi and Tiozzo. Expanding on this work, Qing and Rafi recently developed the quasi-redirecting boundary, denoted $\partial G$, to include all directions of metric spaces at infinity. Both boundaries are topological spaces that consist of equivalence classes of quasi-geodesic rays and are quasi-isometrically invariant. In this paper, we study these boundaries when the space is equipped with a geometric group action. In particular, we show that $G$ acts minimally on $\partial_\kappa G$ and that contracting elements of G induces a weak north-south dynamic on $\partial_\kappa G$. We also prove, when $\partial G$ exists and $|\partial_\kappa G|\geq3$, $G$ acts minimally on $\partial G$ and $\partial G$ is a second countable topological space. The last section concerns the restriction to proper CAT(0) spaces and finite dimensional \CAT cube complexes. We show that when $G$ acts geometrically on a finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex (whose QR boundary is assumed to exist), then a nontrivial QR boundary implies the existence of a Morse element in $G$. Lastly, we show that if $X$ is a proper cocompact CAT(0) space, then $\partial G$ is a visibility space.</description>

      <title>When Gr\"unbaum meets Poncelet -- Infinite Classes of Movable $n_4$ Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relations between $(n_4)$ incidence configurations and the classical Poncelet Porism. Poncelet's result studies two conics and a sequence of points and lines that inscribes one conic and circumscribes the other. Poncelet's Porism states that whether this sequence closes up after $m$ steps only depends on the conics and not on the initial point of the sequence. In other words: Poncelet polygons are movable. We transfer this motion into a flexibility statement about a large class of $(n_4)$ configurations, which are configurations where 4 (straight) lines pass through each point and four points lie on each line. A first instance of such configurations in real geometry had been given by Gr\"unbaum and Rigby in their classical 1990 paper where they constructed the first known real geometric realisation of a well known combinatorial $(21_4)$ configuration (which had been studied by Felix Klein), now called the Gr\"unbaum-Rigby configuration. Since then, there has been an intensive search for movable $(n_4)$ configurations, but it is very surprising that the Gr\"unbaum-Rigby $(21_4)$ configuration admits nontrivial motions. It is well-known that the Gr\"unbaum-Rigby configuration is the smallest example of an infinite class of $(n_4)$ configurations, the trivial celestial configurations. A major result of this paper is that we show that all trivial celestial configurations are movable via Poncelet's Porism and results about properties of Poncelet grids. Alternative approaches via geometry of billiards, in-circle nets, and pentagram maps that relate the subject to discrete integrable systems are given as well.</description>

      <title>Explicit Constructions for Poncelet Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of Poncelet $n$-gons from a projective point of view. In particular we present explicit constructions of Poncelet $n$-gons for certain $n$ and derive algebraic characterisations in terms of bracket polynomials. Via the connections of Poncelet polygons and $(N_4)$-configurations, the results of this article can be used to construct a large class of specific movable $(N_4)$-configurations, the trivial celestial 4-configurations, which up to this point were all thought to be rigid and to require regular polygons for their construction.</description>

      <title>Graphs with nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery curvature without Quadrilateral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of Ricci curvature on graphs in Bakry-\'Emery's sense based on curvature dimension condition was introduced by Lin and Yau [\emph{Math. Res. Lett.}, 2010]. Hua and Lin [\emph{Comm. Anal. Geom.}, 2019] classified unweighted graphs satisfying the curvature dimension condition $CD(0,\infty)$ whose girth are at least five. In this paper, we classify all of connected unweighted normalized $C_4$-free graphs satisfying curvature dimension condition $CD(0,\infty)$ for minimum degree at least 2 and the case with non-normalized Laplacian without degree condition..</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study isometries of quantum Wasserstein distances and divergences on the quantum bit state space. We describe isometries with respect to the symmetric quantum Wasserstein divergence $d_{sym}$, the divergence induced by all of the Pauli matrices. We also give a complete characterization of isometries with respect to $D_z$, the quantum Wasserstein distance corresponding to the single Pauli matrix $\sigma_z$.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoperimetric inequalities for infinite plane graphs with bounded vertex and face degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.04394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sharp bounds for the isoperimetric constants of infinite plane graphs (tessellations) with bounded vertex and face degrees. For example, if $G$ is a plane graph satisfying the inequalities $p_1 \leq \mbox{deg}\ v \leq p_2$ for $v \in V(G)$ and $q_1 \leq \mbox{deg}\ f \leq q_2$ for $f \in F(G)$, where $p_1, p_2, q_1$, and $q_2$ are natural numbers such that $1/p_i + 1/q_i \leq 1/2$, $i=1,2$, then we show that \[ \Phi (p_1, q_1) \leq \inf_S \frac{|\partial S|}{|V(S)|} \leq \Phi (p_2, q_2), \] where the infimum is taken over all finite nonempty subgraphs $S \subset G$, $\partial S$ is the set of edges connecting $S$ to $G \setminus S$, and $\Phi(p,q)$ is defined by \[ \Phi (p, q) = (p-2) \sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{(p-2)(q-2)}}. \] For $p_1=3$ this gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture by Lawrencenko, Plummer, and Zha from 2002, and for general $p_i$ and $q_i$ our result fully resolves a question posed in the book by Lyons and Peres from 2016, where they extended the conjecture of Lawrencenko et al. to the above form.</description>

      <title>On the Gromov hyperbolicity of the minimal metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the hyperbolicity in the sense of Gromov of domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d\geq3)$ with respect to the minimal metric introduced by Forstneri\v{c} and Kalaj. In particular, we prove that every bounded strongly minimally convex domain is Gromov hyperbolic and its Gromov compactification is equivalent to its Euclindean closure. Moreover, we prove that the boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic convex domain does not contain non-trivial conformal harmonic disks. Finally, we study the relation between the minimal metric and the Hilbert metric in convex domains.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter groups have infinite weak cop number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, a variation of the cop number, is an invariant suitable for infinite graphs and is a quasi-isometric invariant. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist locally finite infinite graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists locally finite vertex transitive graphs whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We test this question on Cayley graphs of wreath products, these are objects known for their exotic geometries. We prove that Cayley graphs of wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. The result is proved by defining a new pursuit and evasion game and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. We also include a short argument that Cayley graphs of Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak cop number.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of harmonic functions on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the H\"older regularity condition for harmonic functions on metric measure spaces and prove that under mild volume regular condition and upper heat kernel estimate, the H\"older regularity condition, the weak Bakry-\'Emery non-negative curvature condition, the heat kernel H\"older continuity with or without exponential terms and the heat kernel near-diagonal lower bound are equivalent. As applications, firstly, we prove the validity of the so-called generalized reverse H\"older inequality on the Sierpi\'nski carpet cable system, which was left open by Devyver, Russ, Yang (Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN (2023), no. 18, 15537-15583). Secondly, we prove that two-sided heat kernel estimates alone imply gradient estimate for the heat kernel on strongly recurrent fractal-like cable systems, which improves the main results of the aforementioned paper. Thirdly, we obtain H\"older (Lipschitz) estimate for heat kernel on general metric measure spaces, which extends the classical Li-Yau gradient estimate for heat kernel on Riemannian manifolds.</description>
