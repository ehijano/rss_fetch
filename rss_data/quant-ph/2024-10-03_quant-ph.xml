      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mumax3-cQED: an extension of Mumax3 to simulate magnon-photon interactions in cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the well-known micromagnetic package Mumax3 to simulate magnon-polaritons in realistic magnetic materials and nanostructures. Mumax3-cQED leverages the full GPU-accelerated capabilities of Mumax3 to model standard spin-spin interactions and the coupling of magnetic moments to external space- and time-dependent magnetic fields, with the additional unique feature of including the coupling to a cavity. We validate the code against results obtained from the Dicke model in both the paramagnetic and the superradiant phases. We show that hybrid magnon-light states can be calculated, as well as the non-equilibrium dynamics and their approach to equilibrium. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of Mumax3-cQED to reproduce experimental results and design magnon-cavity experiments, including three-dimensional and coplanar waveguide resonators. The code is fully available and will be useful for designing experiments involving microscopic saturated ferromagnets as well as systems featuring spin textures such as domain walls, vortices, or skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-private distributed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks will provide unconditional security for communication, computation and distributed sensing tasks. We report on an experimental demonstration of private parameter estimation, which allows a global phase to be evaluated without revealing the constituent local phase values. This is achieved by sharing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state among three users who first verify the shared state before performing the sensing task. We implement the verification protocol, based on stabilizer measurements, and measure an average failure rate of 0.038(5) which we use to establish the security and privacy parameters. We validate the privacy conditions established by the protocol by evaluating the quantum Fisher information of the experimentally prepared GHZ states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a sequence of multi-site gates which transform an easily constructed product state into an approximation to the superfluid ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model. The mapping is exact in the one dimensional hard core limit, and for non-interacting particles in both one and two dimensions. The gate sequence has other applications, such as being used as part of a many-body interferometer which probes the existence of doublons.</description>

      <title>Flux-pump induced degradation of $T_1$ for dissipative cat qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative stabilization of cat qubits autonomously corrects for bit flip errors by ensuring that reservoir-engineered two-photon losses dominate over other mechanisms inducing phase flip errors. To describe the latter, we derive an effective master equation for an asymmetrically threaded SQUID based superconducting circuit used to stabilize a dissipative cat qubit. We analyze the dressing of relaxation processes under drives in time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory for weakly anharmonic bosonic degrees of freedom, and in numerically exact Floquet theory. We find that spurious single-photon decay rates can increase under the action of the parametric pump that generates the required interactions for cat-qubit stabilization. Our analysis feeds into mitigation strategies that can inform current experiments, and the methods presented here can be extended to other circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a flexible microwave stripline measured by a superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the demand for scalable cryogenic microwave circuitry continuously rising, recently developed flexible microwave striplines offer the tantalyzing perspective of increasing the cabling density by an order of magnitude without thermally overloading the cryostat. We use a superconducting quantum circuit to test the thermalization of input flex cables with integrated $60\,$dB of attenuation distributed at various temperature stages. From the measured decoherence rate of a superconducting fluxonium qubit, we estimate a residual population of the readout resonator below $3.5\cdot10^{-3}$ photons and we measure a $0.28\,$ms thermalization time for the flexible stripline attenuators. Furthermore, we confirm that the qubit reaches an effective temperature of $26.4\,$mK, close to the base temperature of the cryostat, practically the same as when using a conventional semi-rigid coaxial cable setup.</description>

      <title>Error exponent of activated non-signaling assisted classical-quantum channel coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a tight asymptotic characterization of the error exponent for classical-quantum channel coding assisted by activated non-signaling correlations. Namely, we find that the optimal exponent\, -- \,also called reliability function\, -- \,is equal to the well-known sphere packing bound, which can be written as a single-letter formula optimized over Petz-R\'enyi divergences. Remarkably, there is no critical rate and as such our characterization remains tight for arbitrarily low rates below the capacity. On the achievability side, we further extend our results to fully quantum channels. Our proofs rely on semi-definite program duality and a dual representation of the Petz-R\'enyi divergences via Young inequalities. As a result of independent interest, we find that the Petz-R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha\in[0,2]$ are upper bounded by the sandwiched R\'enyi divergences of order $1/(2-\alpha)\in[1/2,\infty]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a symmetric informationally-complete positive operator-valued measure exists in a given dimension $d$ if and only if there exists a $d^2$-dimensional operator system satisfying certain order-theoretic conditions. We also describe a method of constructing such an operator system and demonstrate that the first step of this construction can be carried out successfully. We obtain analogous results for the existence of $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases in a given dimension.</description>

      <title>H-DES: a Quantum-Classical Hybrid Differential Equation Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an original hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on a variational quantum algorithm for solving systems of differential equations. The algorithm relies on a spectral method, which involves encoding the solution functions in the amplitudes of the quantum states generated by different parametrized circuits and transforms the task of solving the differential equations into an optimization problem. We first describe the principle of the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. We provide a detailed pseudo-code of the algorithm, on which we conduct a complexity analysis to highlight its scaling properties. We apply it to a set of examples, showcasing its applicability across diverse sets of differential equations. We discuss the advantages of our method and potential avenues for further exploration and refinement.</description>

      <title>Phase-coding quantum-key-distribution system based on Sagnac-Mach-Zehnder interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability and robustness are important criteria to evaluate the performance of a quantum-key-distribution (QKD) system in real-life applications. However, the inherent birefringence effect of the fiber channel and disturbance caused by the variation of the deployment environment of the QKD system tremendously decreases its performance. To eliminate this adverse impact, we propose a polarization-insensitive phase-coding QKD system based on Sagnac-Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Verified by theoretical analysis and experimental tests, this QKD system is robust against channel polarization disturbance. The robustness and long-term stability of the QKD system is confirmed with a 10-day continuous operation over a 12.6-dB channel, which consists of a 50-km fiber spool and a polarization scrambler (2 rad/s). As a result, an average quantum bit error rate of 0.958% and a sustained secure key rate of 3.68 kbps are obtained. Moreover, the secure key rate of the QKD system for a typical channel loss of 10 dB reaches 6.89 kbps, and the achievable maximum transmission distance exceeds 125 km.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of quantum secure imaging based on quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum secure imaging (QSI) scheme based on the phase encoding and weak + vacuum decoy-state BB84 protocol of quantum key distribution (QKD). It allows us to implement a computational ghost imaging (CGI) system with more simplified equipment and reconstructed algorithms by using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) to preset the specific spatial distribution of the light intensity. What's more, the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the secure key rate analytical functions of QKD are used to see through the intercept-resend jamming attacks and ensure the authenticity of the imaging information. In the experiment, we obtained the image of the object quickly and efficiently by measuring the signal photon counts with single-photon detector (SPD), and achieved a secure key rate of 571.0 bps and a secure QBER of 3.99%, which is well below the lower bound of QBER of 14.51$\%$. Besides, our imaging system uses a laser with invisible wavelength of 1550 nm, whose intensity is low as single-photon, that can realize weak-light imaging and is immune to the stray light or air turbulence, thus it will become a better choice for quantum security radar against intercept-resend jamming attacks.</description>

      <title>Low depth amplitude estimation without really trying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard quantum amplitude estimation algorithms provide quadratic speedup to Monte-Carlo simulations but require a circuit depth that scales as inverse of the estimation error. In view of the shallow depth in near-term devices, the precision achieved by these algorithms would be low. In this paper we bypass this limitation by performing the classical Monte-Carlo method on the quantum algorithm itself, achieving a higher than classical precision using low-depth circuits. We require the quantum algorithm to be weakly biased in order to avoid error accumulation during this process. Our method is parallel and can be as weakly biased as the constituent algorithm in some cases.</description>

      <title>Informed Dynamic Scheduling for QLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that syndrome-based belief propagation using layered scheduling (sLBP) can not only accelerate the convergence rate but also improve the error rate performance by breaking the quantum trapping sets for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, showcasing a result distinct from classical error correction codes. In this paper, we consider edge-wise informed dynamic scheduling (IDS) for QLDPC codes based on syndrome-based residual belief propagation (sRBP). However, the construction of QLDPC codes and the identical prior intrinsic information assignment will result in an equal residual in many edges, causing a performance limitation for sRBP. Two strategies, including edge pool design and error pre-correction, are introduced to tackle this obstacle and quantum trapping sets. Then, a novel sRBP equipped with a predict-and-reduce-error mechanism (PRE-sRBP) is proposed, which can provide a performance gain on considered QLDPC codes of over one order of magnitude compared to sLBP.</description>

      <title>A coherence method generating macroscopic quantum features using polarization-basis control and its projection measurements of laser light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement between paired photons is the foundation of optical quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum networks. Traditionally, quantum information science has focused on the particle nature of photons at the microscopic scale, often neglecting the phase information of single photons, even for the bipartite quantum entanglement. Recently, a coherence-based approach has been explored to understand the so-called quantum mystery of nonlocal intensity fringes emerging from local randomness. Here, a pure coherence method is presented to create macroscopic quantum features using conventional laser light via linear optics-based measurement modifications. To achieve this, a polarization-basis control of the laser light is conducted to generate indistinguishable characteristics between orthogonally polarized light pairs. Using projection measurements of the polarization-controlled light pairs, we derive coherence solutions of local randomness and nonlocal correlations between independently controlled local parameters, where a fixed relative phase relationship between paired lights is an essential condition to determine the corresponding Bell states.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Preparation of Low-Temperature Gibbs States for 2D Toric Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for preparing the Gibbs state of the two-dimensional toric code Hamiltonian at any temperature, starting from any initial condition, significantly improving upon prior estimates that suggested exponential scaling with inverse temperature. Our approach combines the Lindblad dynamics using a local Davies generator with simple global jump operators to enable efficient transitions between logical sectors. We also prove that the Lindblad dynamics with a digitally implemented low temperature local Davies generator is able to efficiently drive the quantum state towards the ground state manifold. Despite this progress, we explain why protecting quantum information in the 2D toric code with passive dynamics remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Resource Estimation for Delayed Choice Quantum Entanglement Based Sneakernet Networks Using Neutral Atom qLDPC Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is a vital phenomenon required for realizing secure quantum networks, so much that distributed entanglement can be re-imagined as a commodity which can be traded to enable and maintain these networks. We explore the idea of commercializing entanglement-based cryptography and future applications where advanced quantum memory systems support less advanced users. We design a sneakernet-based quantum communication network with a central party connecting the users through delayed-choice quantum entanglement swapping, using quantum Low-Density-Parity-Check (qLDPC) encoded qubits on neutral atoms. Our analysis compares this approach with traditional surface codes, demonstrating that qLDPC codes offer superior scaling in terms of resource efficiency and logical qubit count. We show that with near-term attainable patch sizes, one can attain medium-to-high fidelity correlations, paving the way towards large-scale commercial quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant quantum neural networks (QNNs) are promising quantum machine learning models that exploit symmetries to provide potential quantum advantages. Despite theoretical developments in equivariant QNNs, their implementation on near-term quantum devices remains challenging due to limited computational resources. This study proposes a resource-efficient model of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) called equivariant split-parallelizing QCNN (sp-QCNN). Using a group-theoretical approach, we encode general symmetries into our model beyond the translational symmetry addressed by previous sp-QCNNs. We achieve this by splitting the circuit at the pooling layer while preserving symmetry. This splitting structure effectively parallelizes QCNNs to improve measurement efficiency in estimating the expectation value of an observable and its gradient by order of the number of qubits. Our model also exhibits high trainability and generalization performance, including the absence of barren plateaus. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the equivariant sp-QCNN can be trained and generalized with fewer measurement resources than a conventional equivariant QCNN in a noisy quantum data classification task. Our results contribute to the advancement of practical quantum machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I argue that scientific determinism is not supported by facts, but results from the elegance of the mathematical language physicists use, in particular from the so-called real numbers and their infinite series of digits. Classical physics can thus be interpreted in a deterministic or indeterministic way. However, using quantum physics, some experiments prove that nature is able to continually produce new information, hence support indeterminism in physics.</description>

      <title>Statistical Virtual Temperature of Classical and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a foundational definition of statistical virtual temperature, derived from the spectrum of the Gibbs Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and formulated using d-1 indices of purity (IP), where d represents the Hilbert space dimension within the C*-algebra framework. We demonstrate that the universal physical bounds between von Neumann entropy and statistical virtual temperature are constrained by these IPs, which may offer broader applications to quantum systems. Additionally, we geometrize classical optical polarization states of an arbitrary electromagnetic field and provide an interpretation of the quantum Mpemba effect, where a quantum system prepared at a higher statistical virtual temperature relaxes to equilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. This behavior is explained through a novel concept of temperature-resolved entanglement asymmetry. Additionally, we present a geometric interpretation of the third law of thermodynamics using these entropy-temperature diagrams. Nevertheless, the defined statistical virtual temperature inherently exhibits the third law of thermodynamics. We believe that this work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of classical polarization theory, quantum information theory, and quantum thermodynamics, and it may establish new connections and insights into these fields.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One cannot justifiably presuppose the physical salience of structures derived via decoherence theory based upon an entirely uninterpreted use of the quantum formalism. Non-probabilistic accounts of the emergence of probability via decoherence are thus unconvincing. An alternative account of the emergence of probability involves the combination of \textit{quasi-probabilistic emergence}, via a partially interpreted decoherence model, with \textit{semi-classical emergence}, via averaging of observables with respect to a positive-definite \textit{quasi-probability} function and neglect of terms $O(\hbar)$. This approach avoids well-known issues with constructing classical probability measures in the context of the full set of states of a quantum theory. Rather, it considers a generalised \textit{quasi-measure} structure, \textit{partially interpreted} as weighting of possibilities, over a more general algebra, and delimits the context in which the combination of decoherence and a semi-classical averaging allows us to recover a classical probability model as a coarse-grained description which neglects terms $O(\hbar)$.</description>

      <title>The temperature dependent thermal potential in Quantum Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the thermal transport procedure driven by temperature gradient in terms of linear response theory, Luttinger et al. proposed the thermal scalar and vector potential[1,2] . In this manuscript, we try to address the microscopic origin of these phenomenological thermal potentials. Based on the temperature dependent damping force derived from quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), we express the thermal scalar and vector potential by the distribution function in damping force, which originates from the scattering of conduction electrons. We illustrate this by the scattering of electron-phonon interaction in some systems. The temperature and temperature gradient in the local equilibrium distribution function will have effect on the thermal scalar and vector potentials, which is compatible with the previous works[1,2] . The influence from quantum correction terms in QBE are also considered, which contribute not only to the damping force, but also to the anomalous velocity in the drift term. An approximated solution for the QBE is given, the numerical results for the damping force, thermal current density as well as other physical observable are shown in figures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cryptography from Meta-Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) are the minimal assumption, while recent active studies have demonstrated that OWFs are not necessarily the minimum assumption in quantum cryptography. Several new primitives have been introduced such as pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs), one-way state generators (OWSGs), one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), and EFI pairs. They are believed to be weaker than OWFs, but they still imply many useful applications. Now that the possibility of quantum cryptography without OWFs has opened up, the most important goal in the field is to provide them with concrete instantiations. However, in quantum cryptography, all known constructions of those primitives are only from OWFs. We therefore have the following important open problem: Do they have instantiations based on some concrete hardness assumptions that will not imply OWFs? Ideally, the assumptions should be the ones that are studied in other contexts than cryptography. In this paper, we give a candidate answer to the question by showing that quantum-average-hardness of GapK problem implies the existence of OWPuzzs. As far as we know, this is the first time that a ``Microcrypt'' primitive is constructed based on concrete hardness assumptions that do not seem to imply OWFs. Moreover, the assumptions are studied in other contexts than cryptography, especially in the field of meta-complexity.</description>

      <title>Supermaps between channels of any type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermaps between quantum channels (completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps of matrix algebras) were introduced in [Chiribella et al., EPL 83(3) (2008)]. In this work we generalise to supermaps between channels of any type; by channels we mean CPTP maps of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Channels include POVMs, quantum instruments, classically controlled families of quantum channels, classical channels, quantum multimeters, and more. We show that deterministic supermaps between channels of any type can be realised using simple circuits, recovering the previous realisation theorems of [Chiribella et al., EPL 83(3) (2008)] (for deterministic supermaps between quantum channels) and [Bluhm et al. (2024)] (for deterministic supermaps between quantum multimeters) as special cases. To prove this realisation theorem we use the graphical calculus of the 2-category of finite-dimensional 2-Hilbert spaces; the paper includes an accessible and elementary introduction to this graphical calculus, and no prior knowledge of category theory is expected of the reader.</description>

      <title>BEADS: A Canonical Visualization of Quantum States for Applications in Quantum Information Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we introduce a generalized phase-space representation of qubit systems called the BEADS representation which makes it possible to visualize arbitrary quantum states in an intuitive and an easy to grasp way. At the same time, our representation is exact, bijective, and general. It bridges the gap between the highly abstract mathematical description of quantum mechanical phenomena and the mission to convey them to non-specialists in terms of meaningful pictures and tangible models. Several levels of simplifications can be chosen, e.g., when using the BEADS representation in the communication of quantum mechanics to the general public. In particular, this visualization has predictive power in contrast to simple metaphors such as Schr\"odinger's cat.</description>

      <title>Universal and robust dynamic decoupling controls for zero-field magnetometry by using molecular clock sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in diamond and silicon carbide (SiC), and molecular spins through a host matrix control are promising for nanoscale quantum sensing because they can be optically addressable, coherently controllable, and placed proximate to the targets. However, large transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) is often inevitable due to their intrinsic symmetry and/or the high local strains of the host matrix. Although spin coherence can be extended due to magnetic noise-insensitive clock transitions at a vanishing magnetic field, the eigenstates of these sensors are not sensitive to weak magnetic signals in the linear order. We address this challenge by employing a combination of radio-frequency (RF) field driving along the NV orientation and microwave (MW) dynamic decoupling pulse sequences. RF driving can effectively mitigate the transverse ZFS effect and enhance the NV center's sensitivity to AC magnetic field signals. This combination not only suppresses environmental noise but also enables quantum frequency mixing between the transverse ZFS and the signal. It also offers the potential to detect weak AC signals at intermediate and high frequencies with high resolution, a task difficult to achieve using conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have hinted towards an upcoming era of quantum utility, in which quantum hardware is able to outperform classical simulation methods for a variety of real-world applications. In this work, we show how application-inspired families of Clifford circuits can be used to benchmark the capabilities of current hardware for running certain applications, providing a prediction as to how measured expectation value fidelities scale with circuit depth. Considering the specific example of simulating kicked-Ising circuits, we benchmark a 127-qubit superconducting device and suggest how our circuits can also be used to benchmark recent classical simulation methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new scheme for near-term photonic quantum device that allows to increase the expressive power of the quantum models beyond what linear optics can do. This scheme relies upon state injection, a measurement-based technique that can produce states that are more controllable, and solve learning tasks that are not believed to be tackled classically. We explain how circuits made of linear optical architectures separated by state injections are keen for experimental implementation. In addition, we give theoretical results on the evolution of the purity of the resulting states, and we discuss how it impacts the distinguishability of the circuit outputs. Finally, we study a computational subroutines of learning algorithms named probability estimation, and we show the state injection scheme we propose may offer a potential quantum advantage in a regime that can be more easily achieved that state-of-the-art adaptive techniques. Our analysis offers new possibilities for near-term advantage that require to tackle fewer experimental difficulties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Photonic Gates with Two-Dimensional Random Walkers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gates are essential elements for processing quantum information. However, realizing them in a photonic platform is challenging due to the unique way photons propagate and interfere. In this study, we introduce new design of quantum photonic gates that operate based on continuous time two-dimensional random walking photons. These gates can be implemented using the inverse design method, where photons randomly walk in a two-dimensional silicon host medium embedded with silicon dioxide scatterers. We propose a C-NOT gate as a multiqubit gate and an X-gate as a single qubit gate. We will also provide numerical demonstrations of the gate operations using quantum formalism. Additionally, our investigation involves studying the non-trivial spatial correlations of random walking photons by utilizing the quantum correlation function. The results demonstrate high-fidelity probabilistic quantum gates. Further work is required to address error-correction. This work advances the practical implementation of integrated photonics in linear quantum optics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Faraday effect can be derived from a simple two-state model. This approach uses a quantized electromagnetic field and does not make reference to differences in refractive indices of left- and right-circularly polarized light. Instead it treats the effect as a forward Rayleigh scattering process between two orthogonal modes of the quantized field, and thus emphasises the quantum-mechanical aspects of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation and transfer of nonclassical states in strongly interacting light-matter systems in cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose leveraging strong and ultrastrong light-matter coupling to efficiently generate and exchange nonclassical light and quantum matter states. Two initial conditions are considered: (a) a displaced quadrature-squeezed matter state, and (b) a coherent state in a cavity. In both scenarios, polaritons mediate the dynamical generation and transfer of nonclassical states between light and matter. By monitoring the dynamics of both subsystems, we uncover the emergence of beatings in the collective matter oscillations. The beating period depends on the particle density through the vacuum Rabi splitting and peaks sharply under light-matter resonance conditions. For initial condition (a), nonclassicality is efficiently transferred from matter to photons under strong and ultrastrong coupling. However, for initial condition (b), nonclassical photonic states are generated only in the ultrastrong coupling regime due to the counter-rotating terms, highlighting the advantages of ultrastrong coupling. Furthermore, in the ultrastrong coupling regime, distinctive asymmetries relative to cavity detuning emerge in dynamical observables of both light and matter. The nonclassical photons can be extracted through a semi-transparent cavity mirror, while nonclassical matter states can be detected via time-resolved spectroscopy. This work highlights that hybrid polariton states can be utilized for dynamically generating nonclassical states, with potential applications in quantum state transfer.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information theory explores numerous properties that surpass classical paradigms, offering novel applications and benefits. Among these properties, negative conditional von Neumann entropy (CVNE) is particularly significant in entangled quantum systems, serving as an indicator of potential advantages in various information-theoretic tasks, despite its indirect observability. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between CVNE and the violation of Bell inequalities. Our goal is to establish upper bounds on CVNE through semi-definite programming applied to entangled qubits and qutrits, utilizing selected Bell operators.
  Our findings reveal that a semi-device-independent certification of negative CVNE is achievable and could be practically beneficial. We further explore two types of robustness: robustness against detection efficiency loopholes, measured by relative violation, and robustness against white noise and imperfections in state preparation, measured by critical visibility. Additionally, we analyze parametrized families of Bell inequalities to identify optimal parameters for different robustness criteria.
  This study demonstrates that different Bell inequalities exhibit varying degrees of robustness depending on the desired properties, such as the type of noise resistance or the target level of negative CVNE. By bridging the gap between Bell inequalities and CVNE, our research enhances understanding of the quantum properties of entangled systems and offers insights for practical quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Echo protocols of an optical quantum memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on new obtained analytical results, the main properties of photon echo quantum memory protocols are analysed and discussed together with recently achieved experimental results. The main attention is paid to studying the influence of spectral dispersion and nonlinear interaction of light pulses with resonant atoms. The distinctive features of the effect of spectral dispersion on the quantum storage of broadband signal pulses in the studied echo protocols are identified and discussed. Using photon echo area theorem, closed analytical solutions for echo protocols of quantum memory are obtained, describing the storage of weak and intense signal pulses, allowing us to find the conditions for the implementation of high efficiency in the echo protocols under strong nonlinear interaction of signal and control pulses with atoms. The key existing practical problems and the ways to solve them in realistic experimental conditions are outlined. We also briefly discuss the potential of using the considered photon echo quantum memory protocols in a quantum repeater.</description>

      <title>MaxSAT decoders for arbitrary CSS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for operating quantum computers in the presence of noise. Here, we accurately decode arbitrary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes via the maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. We show how to map quantum maximum likelihood problem of CSS codes of arbitrary geometry and parity check weight into MaxSAT problems. We incorporate the syndrome measurements as hard clauses, while qubit and measurement error probabilities, including biased and non-uniform, are encoded as soft MaxSAT clauses. For the code capacity of color codes on a hexagonal lattice, our decoder has a higher threshold and superior scaling in noise suppression compared to belief propagation with ordered statistics post-processing (BP-OSD), while showing similar scaling in computational cost. Further, we decode surface codes and recently proposed bivariate quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes where we find lower error rates than BP-OSD. Finally, we connect the complexity of MaxSAT decoding to a computational phase transition controlled by the clause density of the MaxSAT problem, where we show that our mapping is always in the computationally ''easy`` phase. Our MaxSAT decoder can be further parallelised or implemented on ASICs and FPGAs, promising potential further speedups of several orders of magnitude. Our work provides a flexible platform towards practical applications on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Conditional entropy and information of quantum processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What would be a reasonable definition of the conditional entropy of bipartite quantum processes, and what novel insight would it provide? We develop this notion using four information-theoretic axioms and define the corresponding quantitative formulas. Our definitions of the conditional entropies of channels are based on the generalized state and channel divergences, such as quantum relative entropy, min- and max-relative entropy, etc. We show that the conditional entropy of quantum channels can potentially reveal important features of the channel, such as its underlying causal structure, which cannot be captured by the entropy of quantum channels or the conditional entropy of bipartite states. Specifically, if the von Neumann conditional entropy $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}$ of a quantum channel $\mathcal{N}_{A'B'\to AB}$ is strictly less than $-\log|A|$, then the channel necessarily has causal influence from $A'$ to $B$. Furthermore, we show that our definition of conditional entropy establishes the strong subadditivity of the entropy for quantum channels. We study the total amount of correlations possible due to quantum processes by defining the multipartite mutual information of quantum channels.</description>

      <title>The horocycle regulator: exact cutoff-independence in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the entanglement entropy of a single subregion in quantum field theory is formally infinite and requires regularization, certain combinations of entropies are perfectly finite in the limit that the regulator is removed, the mutual information being a common example. For generic regulator schemes, such as a holographic calculation with a uniform radial cutoff, these quantities show non-trivial dependence on the regulator at finite values of the cutoff. We investigate a holographic regularization scheme defined in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space constructed from \textit{horocycles}, curves in two-dimensional hyperbolic space perpendicular to all geodesics approaching a single point on the boundary, that leads to finite information measures that are \textit{totally} cutoff-independent, even at finite values of the regulator. We describe a broad class of such information measures, and describe how the field theory dual to the horocycle regulator is inherently non-local.</description>

      <title>Itinerant magnetism in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of experimental platforms, ranging from semiconductor quantum-dot arrays to moir\'e materials, have recently emerged as powerful quantum simulators for studying the Hubbard model and its variants. Motivated by these developments, here, we investigate a generalization of the Hubbard model which includes the effects of long-range Coulomb interactions. Working on finite-sized two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, we use exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group calculations to probe the magnetic structure of the ground state in the strong-coupling regime, where $U$ (the onsite repulsion) $\gg$ $t$ (the nearest-neighbor hopping). For small electron dopings above the half-filled antiferromagnet, we numerically uncover a rich variety of magnetically ordered states, and in conjunction with theoretical arguments, infer the phase diagram of the system as a function of doping and interaction strengths. In particular, we find that the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interactions induces an instability of high-spin states$\unicode{x2014}$such as the saturated Nagaoka ferromagnet$\unicode{x2014}$towards phase separation and stripe ordering. We also present proposals for the observation of some of our key findings in experiments that would shed further light on this paradigmatic strongly correlated system.</description>

      <title>First-principles computational methods for quantum defects in two-dimensional materials: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum defects are atomic defects in materials that provide resources to construct quantum information devices such as single-photon emitters (SPEs) and spin qubits. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials gained prominence as a host of quantum defects with many attractive features derived from their atomically thin and layered material formfactor. In this perspective, we discuss first-principles computational methods and challenges to predict the spin and electronic properties of quantum defects in 2D materials. We focus on the open quantum system nature of the defects and their interaction with external parameters such as electric field, magnetic field, and lattice strain. We also discuss how such prediction and understanding can be used to guide experimental studies, ranging from defect identification to tuning of their spin and optical properties. This perspective provides significant insights into the interplay between the defect, the host material, and the environment, which will be essential in the pursuit of ideal two-dimensional quantum defect platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic condensation through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and open new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>

      <title>Measuring Blackbody Noise in Silica Optical Fibres for Quantum and Classical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deployment of practical quantum networks, which operate at or near single photon levels, requires carefully quantifying noise processes. We investigate noise due to blackbody radiation emitted into the guided mode of silica single mode optical fibres near room temperature, which to date is under-explored in the literature. We utilise a single photon avalanche detector and lock in detection to measure $\approx$0.1 photons/s/THz ($\approx$-170dBm/THz) at 40{\deg}C near the optically thick limit of 20km in silica fibre. We also measure a coarse spectrum to validate the blackbody behaviour, and observe a prominent anomaly around the 1430nm CWDM channel, likely due to -OH impurities. Though the magnitude of this noise is small, it is additive noise which imposes a fundamental limit in raw fidelity in quantum communication, and a fundamental noise floor in classical communication over optical fibres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plasma mirror is an optical device for high-power, ultrashort-wavelength electromagnetic fields, utilizing a sheet of relativistic oscillating electrons to generate and manipulate light. In this work, we propose that the spatiotemporally varying plasma oscillation, induced by an ultra-high-intensity laser beam, functions as a "spacetime mirror" with significant potential for exploring quantum light. We find that the spacetime mirror exhibits several exotic features: (i) a superluminal spacetime boundary, (ii) time reflection and refraction, and (iii) quantum light sources with pair generation. Our theoretical and simulation results are in excellent agreement, and experimental verification is underway. Our work demonstrates the interplay with emerging fields such as time varying media, suggesting the plasma mirror as an ideal platform to study strong-field quantum optics at extremes.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Resonator with Extreme Dispersion to Enable a Test of the Electric-Scalar Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cylindrical microwave cavity resonator operating in the TM$_{0,1,0}$ mode was excited using an interferometric configuration that allowed manipulation of the electric field and potential within the resonator by adjusting the phase and amplitude in the two interferometer arms driving the resonator. With precise tuning of the phase and amplitude, 25 dB suppression of the electric field at the resonance frequency was achieved while simultaneously resonantly enhancing the amplitude of the time-varying electric-scalar potential. Under these balanced conditions, the system demonstrated extreme dispersion in the cavity response due to the introduction of an anti-resonance at the resonance frequency. This creates a phenomenon similar to electromagnetically induced transparency, leading to an increase in the cavity phase response by an order of magnitude. This work presents an experimental setup with the features that will allow the electric-scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect to be tested under conditions involving a time-varying electric-scalar potential, without the presence of an electric field or magnetic vector potential, an experiment that has not yet been realised.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in the study of topological multi-boundary entanglement in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory (with gauge group $G$ and level $k$) suggest a strong interplay between entanglement measures and number theory. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, we conjecture that the 'sum of the negative powers of the quantum dimensions of all integrable highest weight representations at level $k$' is an integer multiple of the Witten zeta function of $G$ when $k \to \infty$. This provides an alternative way to compute these zeta functions, and we present some examples. Next, we use this conjecture to investigate number-theoretic properties of the R\'enyi entropies of the quantum state associated with the $S^3$ complement of torus links of type $T_{p,p}$. In particular, we show that in the semiclassical limit of $k \to \infty$, these entropies converge to a finite value. This finite value can be written in terms of the Witten zeta functions of the group $G$ evaluated at positive even integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current climate models often struggle with accuracy because they lack sufficient resolution, a limitation caused by computational constraints. This reduces the precision of weather forecasts and long-term climate predictions. To address this issue, we explored the use of quantum computing to enhance traditional machine learning (ML) models. We replaced conventional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Encoder-Decoder frameworks with their quantum versions: Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), Quantum Multilayer Perceptrons (QMLP), and Quantum Encoder-Decoders (QED). These quantum models proved to be more accurate in predicting climate-related outcomes compared to their classical counterparts. Using the ClimSim dataset, a large collection of climate data created specifically for ML-based climate prediction, we trained and tested these quantum models. Individually, the quantum models performed better, but their performance was further improved when we combined them using a meta-ensemble approach, which merged the strengths of each model to achieve the highest accuracy overall. This study demonstrates that quantum machine learning can significantly improve the resolution and accuracy of climate simulations. The results offer new possibilities for better predicting climate trends and weather events, which could have important implications for both scientific understanding and policy-making in the face of global climate challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of an electrostatic logarithmic trap (ELT) on an ionic gas confined in a cylindric chamber are studied in detail, with special reference to the effects of the ion-ion Coulombic interactions and the resulting low-temperature thermodynamics. The collapse of the ions in radially localized states, about the axial cathode, is shown to cause an abrupt (but not critical) transition from non degeneration to strong degeneration, at a special temperature $T_c$. This transition could actually involve both Bosons and Fermions and is not to be confused with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is excluded in principle. However, while for Bosons the resulting effects on the pressure are observable in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) regime, the Fermions' density should fall well below UHV, for the pressure change to be observable. This is because the ion-ion \emph{exchange} interactions increase the kinetic energy along the axial cathode, which makes the Fermi level and the non degeneration threshold temperature increase accordingly.</description>

      <title>Short-time Accuracy and Intra-electron Correlation for Nonadiabatic Quantum-Classical Mapping Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic quantum-classical mapping approaches have significantly gained in popularity in the past several decades because they have acceptable accuracy while remaining numerically tractable even for large system sizes. In the recent few years, several novel mapping approaches have been developed that display higher accuracy than the traditional Ehrenfest method, linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR), and Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME) approaches. While various benchmarks have already demonstrated the advantages and limitations of those methods, rigorous theoretical justifications of their short-time accuracy are still demanded. In this article, we systematically examine the intra-electron correlation, as a statistical measure of electronic phase space, which has been first formally proposed for mapping approaches in the context of the generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation (GDTWA) and which is a key ingredient for the improvement of short-time accuracy of such mapping approaches. We rigorously establish the connection between short-time accuracy and intra-electron correlation for various widely used models. We find that LSC-IVR, PBME, and Ehrenfest methods fail to correctly reproduce the intra-electron correlation. While some of the traceless Meyer--Miller--Stock--Thoss (MMST) approaches, partially linearized density matrix (PLDM) approach, and spin partially linearized density matrix (Spin-PLDM) approach are able to sample the intra-electron correlation correctly, the spin linearized semiclassical (Spin-LSC) approach and the other traceless MMST approaches sample the intra-correlation faithfully only for two-level systems. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into the short-time accuracy of semiclassical methods and presents mathematical justifications for previous numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Rabi oscillations at three-photon laser excitation of a single rubidium Rydberg atom in an optical dipole trap</title>

Abstract: In an experiment on three-photon laser excitation $5S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2} \to 6S_{1/2} \to 37P_{3/2}$ of a single $^{87}$Rb Rydberg atom in an optical dipole trap, we have observed for the first time three-photon Rabi oscillations between the ground and the Rydberg states. The single atom was detected optically by measuring the signal of resonant fluorescence with a low-noise sCMOS video camera. Relative probability of the atom to remain in the trap after the action of three synchronized laser excitation pulses was measured for their durations varied in the range from 100 ns to 2 $\mu$s. A specific feature of the experiment was the usage of intense laser radiation at the wavelength of 1367 nm on the second excitation step, which provided the single-photon Rabi frequency up to 2 GHz to control the effective detunings of the intermediate levels of the three-photon transition due to ac Stark effect. We have detected Rabi oscillations with frequency from 1 to 5 MHz depending on the intensities of the laser pulses on the first and the second excitation steps with the coherence time of 0.7-0.8 $\mu$s. The ways to increase the coherence time and contrast of the three-photon Rabi oscillations for applications in quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms are discussed.</description>

      <title>Revealing non-Markovian Kondo transport with waiting time distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-Markovian transport dynamics and signatures of the Kondo effect in a single impurity Anderson model. The model consists of a quantum dot (QD) with ultra-strong coupling to a left lead and weak coupling to a right lead acting as a detector. We calculate the waiting time distribution (WTD) of electrons tunneling into the detector using a combination of the hierarchical equations of motion approach (HEOM) and a dressed master equation. Oscillations emerge in the short-time WTD, becoming more pronounced with stronger left-lead coupling. Fourier analysis reveals a blue shift in the oscillation frequency as coupling increases, indicating enhanced system-bath hybridization. Crucially, comparison with a dressed master equation confirms that these oscillations are a direct consequence of non-Markovian system-bath correlations. We examine the Kondo effect's influence on these oscillations by varying the quantum dot's Coulomb repulsion. Increasing this interaction enhances the WTD oscillations, coinciding with the signatures of a strengthened Kondo resonance in the quantum dot's density of states. Our results demonstrate that WTD oscillations offer a valuable tool for probing non-Markovian system-bath interactions and the emergence of Kondo correlations within quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>$^{229}\mathrm{ThF}_4$ thin films for solid-state nuclear clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After nearly fifty years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited [1,2] and measured with high spectroscopic precision [3]. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust [4,5] than and may outperform [6,7] current optical atomic clocks. They also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model [5,8,9]. In light of these important advances and applications, a dramatic increase in the need for $^{229}$Th spectroscopy targets in a variety of platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration $^{229}$Th-doped crystals [5] used in previous measurements [1-3,10] are challenging due to the scarcity and radioactivity of the $^{229}$Th material. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by demonstrating laser excitation of the nuclear transition in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films grown with a physical vapor deposition process, consuming only micrograms of $^{229}$Th material. The $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical \thor-doped crystals [1-3,10]. The high nuclear emitter density in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime. Finally, we describe the operation and present the estimation of the performance of a nuclear clock based on a defect-free ThF$_4$ crystal.</description>

      <title>Diosi-Penrose criterion for solids and electrical components in quantum superpositions and application to a single-photon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.00353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Diosi-Penrose criterion is applied to solids in quantum superpositions that are slightly displaced against each other or have different expansions in the superposed states. The calculations take the microscopic mass distribution of the solid's nuclei into account, where the spatial variation of the nuclei is calculated with Debye's model for acoustical phonons. The contribution resulting from the mass concentration in the solid's nuclei can be neglected for displacements larger than ten lattice constants but dominates the superposition's decay for displacements smaller than the spatial variation of the nuclei in the order of a tenth of an Angstroem. In this regime, the parameter-free Diosi-Penrose model predicts significantly higher decay rates than the version in which the mass density is averaged. With the results for solids, formulas for the decay of superposed electrical components, as plate capacitors, resistors, wires and piezo actuators, are derived, which are used to analyse how long a single-photon detector can stay in a superposition of a photon-detected and a no-photon-detected state, and how its lifetime shortens when it displaces a mass with a piezo actuator.</description>

      <title>On exploring the potential of quantum auto-encoder for learning quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequent interactions between quantum computing and machine learning revolutionize both fields. One prototypical achievement is the quantum auto-encoder (QAE), as the leading strategy to relieve the curse of dimensionality ubiquitous in the quantum world. Despite its attractive capabilities, practical applications of QAE have yet largely unexplored. To narrow this knowledge gap, here we devise three effective QAE-based learning protocols to address three classically computational hard learning problems when learning quantum systems, which are low-rank state fidelity estimation, quantum Fisher information estimation, and Gibbs state preparation. Attributed to the versatility of QAE, our proposals can be readily executed on near-term quantum machines. Besides, we analyze the error bounds of the trained protocols and showcase the necessary conditions to provide practical utility from the perspective of complexity theory. We conduct numerical simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed three protocols. Our work sheds new light on developing advanced quantum learning algorithms to accomplish hard quantum physics and quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Branching States as The Emergent Structure of a Quantum Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.05497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism builds on decoherence theory to explain the emergence of classical behavior in a fundamentally quantum universe. Within this framework we prove two crucial insights about the emergence of classical phenomenology, centered around quantum discord as the measure of quantumness of correlations. First, we show that the so-called branching structure of the joint state of the system and environment is the only one compatible with zero discord. Second, we prove that for small but nonzero discord and for good but not perfect decoherence, the structure of the globally pure state must be arbitrarily close to the branching form, with each branch exhibiting low entanglement. Our results significantly improve on previous bounds and reinforce the existing evidence that this class of branching states is the only one compatible with the emergence of classical phenomenology, as described by Quantum Darwinism.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Formulation of the Quantum Phase Estimation Using Projection-Based Tensor Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper an alternative version of the quantum phase estimation is proposed, in which the Hadamard gates at the beginning are substituted by a quantum Fourier transform. This new circuit coincides with the original one, when the ancilla is initialized with $\ket{0}$. With the help of a projection-based tensor decomposition and closed-form expressions of its exponential, this new method can be interpreted as a multiplier coupled to the Hamiltonian of the corresponding target unitary operator. Based on this observation a recursive decomposition is derived.</description>

      <title>Recycling of a quantum field and optimal states for single-qubit rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08242v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of quantized field states that can perform exact (entanglement- and error-free) rotations of a two-level atom starting from a specific state on the Bloch sphere. We discuss the similarities and differences between these states and the recently-introduced "transcoherent states." Our field states have the property that they are left unchanged after the rotation, and we find they are the asymptotic states obtained when a field interacts with a succession of identically prepared ancillary atoms. Such a scheme was recently proposed [npj Quantum Information 3:17 (2017)] as a way to "restore" a field state after its interaction with a two-level atom, so as to reuse it afterwards, thus reducing the energy requirements for successive quantum logical operations. We generalize this scheme to find optimal pulses for arbitrary rotations, and also study analytically what happens if the ancillas are in a mixed, rather than a pure state. Consistent with the numerical results in the original proposal, we find that as long as the ancilla preparation error is small (of the order of $1/\bar n$, where $\bar n$ is the average number of atoms in the pulses considered) it will introduce only higher-order errors in the performance of the restored pulse.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-assisted quantum architecture search for variational quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function. Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem. The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with an $\epsilon$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods we propose in the thesis can be readily adapted to address a wide range of other VQAs.</description>

      <title>Linear cross-entropy certification of quantum computational advantage in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Validation of quantum advantage claims in the context of Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) currently relies on providing evidence that the experimental samples genuinely follow their corresponding ground truth, i.e., the theoretical model of the experiment that includes all the possible losses that the experimenters can account for. This approach to verification has an important drawback: it is necessary to assume that the ground truth distributions are computationally hard to sample, that is, that they are sufficiently close to the distribution of the ideal, lossless experiment, for which there is evidence that sampling, either exactly or approximately, is a computationally hard task. This assumption, which cannot be easily confirmed, opens the door to classical algorithms that exploit the noise in the ground truth to efficiently simulate the experiments, thus undermining any quantum advantage claim. In this work, we argue that one can avoid this issue by validating GBS implementations using their corresponding ideal distributions directly. We explain how to use a modified version of the linear cross-entropy, a measure that we call the LXE score, to find reference values that help us assess how close a given GBS implementation is to its corresponding ideal model. Finally, we analytically compute the score that would be obtained by a lossless GBS implementation.</description>

      <title>Dissipative phase transition: from qubits to qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of dissipative phase transitions in quantum many-body systems when the individual constituents are qudits ($d$-level systems) instead of qubits. As an example system, we employ a permutation-invariant $XY$ model of $N$ infinite-range interacting $d$-level spins undergoing individual and collective dissipation. In the mean-field limit, we identify a dissipative phase transition, whose critical point is independent of $d$ after a suitable rescaling of parameters. When the decay rates between all adjacent levels are identical and $d\geq 4$, the critical point expands, in terms of the ratio between dissipation and interaction strengths, to a critical region in which two phases coexist and which increases as $d$ grows. In addition, a larger $d$ leads to a more pronounced change in spin expectation values at the critical point. Numerical investigations for finite $N$ reveal symmetry breaking signatures in the Liouvillian spectrum at the phase transition. The phase transition is furthermore marked by maximum entanglement negativity and a significant purity change of the steady state, which become more pronounced as $d$ increases. Considering qudits instead of qubits thus opens new perspectives on accessing rich phase diagrams in open many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tree-like process tensor contraction for automated compression of environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algorithm "automated compression of environments" (ACE) [Nat. Phys. 18, 662 (2022)] provides a versatile way of simulating an extremely broad class of open quantum systems. This is achieved by encapsulating the influence of the environment, which is determined by the interaction Hamiltonian(s) and initial states, into compact process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) representations. The generality of the ACE method comes at high numerical cost. Here, we demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvement of ACE is possible by changing the order of PT-MPO contraction from a sequential to a tree-like scheme. The problem of combining two partial PT-MPOs with large inner bonds is solved by a preselection approach. The drawbacks of the preselection approach are that the MPO compression is suboptimal and that it is more prone to error accumulation than sequential combination and compression. We therefore also identify strategies to mitigate these disadvantages by fine-tuning compression parameters. This results in a scheme that is similar in compression efficiency and accuracy to the original ACE algorithm, yet is significantly faster. Our numerical experiments reach similar conclusions for bosonic and fermionic test cases, suggesting that our findings are characteristic of the combination of PT-MPOs more generally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fault-tolerant quantum computer must decode and correct errors faster than they appear to prevent exponential slowdown due to error correction. The Union-Find (UF) decoder is promising with an average time complexity slightly higher than $O(d^3)$. We report a distributed version of the UF decoder that exploits parallel computing resources for further speedup. Using an FPGA-based implementation, we empirically show that this distributed UF decoder has a sublinear average time complexity with regard to $d$, given $O(d^3)$ parallel computing resources. The decoding time per measurement round decreases as $d$ increases, the first time for a quantum error decoder. The implementation employs a scalable architecture called Helios that organizes parallel computing resources into a hybrid tree-grid structure. Using a Xilinx VCU129 FPGA, we successfully implement $d$ up to 21 with an average decoding time of 11.5 ns per measurement round under 0.1\% phenomenological noise, and 23.7 ns for $d=17$ under equivalent circuit-level noise. This performance is significantly faster than any existing decoder implementation. Furthermore, we show that Helios can optimize for resource efficiency by decoding $d=51$ on a Xilinx VCU129 FPGA with an average latency of 544ns per measurement round.</description>

Abstract: Current benchmarks for mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are limited in scalability or the types of error they can quantify, necessitating new techniques for quantifying their performance. Here, we introduce a theory for learning Pauli noise in MCMs and use it to create MCM cycle benchmarking, a scalable method for benchmarking MCMs. MCM cycle benchmarking extracts detailed information about the rates of errors in randomly compiled layers of MCMs and Clifford gates, and we demonstrate how its results can be used to quantify correlated errors during MCMs on current quantum hardware. Our method can be integrated into existing Pauli noise learning techniques to scalably characterize and benchmark wide classes of circuits containing MCMs.</description>

      <title>Robustness of contextuality under different types of noise as quantifiers for parity-oblivious multiplexing tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised contextuality is the notion of nonclassicality powering up a myriad of quantum tasks, among which is the celebrated case of a two-party information processing task where classical information is compressed in a quantum channel, the parity-oblivious multiplexing (POM) task. The success rate is the standard quantifier of resourcefulness for this task, while robustness-based quantifiers are as operationally motivated and have known general properties. In this work, we leverage analytical and numerical tools to estimate robustness of contextuality in POM scenarios under different types of noise. We conclude that for the 3-to-1 case robustness of contextuality to depolarisation, as well as a minimisation of robustness of contextuality to dephasing over all bases, are good quantifiers for the nonclassical advantage of this scenario. Moreover, we obtain a general relation between robustness of contextuality to depolarisation and the success rate in any $n$-to-1 POM scenario and show how it can be used to bound the number of bits encoded in this task.</description>

      <title>Advances in quantum algorithms for the shortest path problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an undirected, weighted graph, and two special vertices $s$ and $t$, the problem is to find the shortest path between them. We give two bounded-error quantum algorithms in the adjacency list model that solve the problem on structured instances. The first approach is based on sparsifying the original graph via sampling the quantum flow state and running a classical algorithm on the smaller problem. It has query complexity of $\tilde{O}(l^2\sqrt{m})$ and uses $O(\log{n})$ space, where $l$ is the length (or total weight, in case of weighted graphs) of the shortest $s$-$t$ path. The main result is the second approach which is based on a divide and conquer procedure that outputs the shortest path in $\tilde{O}(l\sqrt{m})$ steps when using $O(\log{n})$ space and can be parallelised to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{lm})$ circuit depth when using $O(l\log{n})$ space. With the latter, we partially resolve with an affirmative answer the open problem of whether a path between two vertices can be found in the time required to detect it.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED Spectra in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime: How They Differ from Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between resonator-confined radiation and natural atoms or other formally equivalent quantum excitations, under conditions where the quantum nature of photons is relevant. Phenomena studied in cavity QED can also be explored using superconducting artificial atoms and microwave photons in superconducting resonators. These circuit QED systems offer the possibility to reach the ultrastrong coupling regime with individual artificial atoms, unlike their natural counterparts. In this regime, the light-matter coupling strength reaches a considerable fraction of the bare resonance frequencies in the system. Here, we provide a careful analysis of both incoherent and coherent spectra in circuit QED systems consisting of a flux qubit interacting with an LC resonator. Despite these systems can be effectively described by the quantum Rabi model, as the corresponding cavity QED ones, we find distinctive features, depending on how the system is coupled to the output port, which become evident in the ultrastrong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing versus classical solvers: Applications, challenges and limitations for optimisation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, harnessing the power of qubits' superposition and entanglement for computational advantages over classical systems. However, scalability poses a primary challenge for these machines. By implementing a hybrid workflow between classical and quantum computing instances, D-Wave has succeeded in pushing this boundary to the realm of industrial use. Furthermore, they have recently opened up to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, expanding their applicability to many relevant problems in the field of optimisation. However, the extent of their suitability for diverse problem categories and their computational advantages remains unclear. This study conducts a comprehensive examination by applying a selection of diverse case studies to benchmark the performance of D-Wave's hybrid solver against that of industry-leading solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and IPOPT. The findings indicate that D-Wave's hybrid solver is currently most advantageous for integer quadratic objective functions and shows potential for quadratic constraints. To illustrate this, we applied it to a real-world energy problem, specifically the MILP unit commitment problem. While D-Wave can solve such problems, its performance has not yet matched that of its classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Element-specific, non-destructive profiling of layered heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures is now so precise that metrology has become a key challenge for progress in science and applications. It is now relatively straightforward to characterize classic III-V and group IV heterostructures consisting of slabs of different semiconductor alloys with thicknesses of $\sim$5 nm and greater using sophisticated tools such as X-ray diffraction, high energy X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. However, profiling thin layers with nm or sub-nm thickness, e.g. atomically thin dopant layers ($\delta$-layers), of impurities required for modulation doping and spin-based quantum and classical information technologies is more challenging.
  Here, we present theory and experiment showing how resonant-contrast X-ray reflectometry meets this challenge. The technique takes advantage of the change in the scattering factor of atoms as their core level resonances are scanned by varying the X-ray energy. We demonstrate the capability of the resulting element-selective, non-destructive profilometry for single arsenic $\delta$-layers within silicon, and show that the sub-nm electronic thickness of the $\delta$-layers corresponds to sub-nm chemical thickness. In combination with X-ray fluorescence imaging, this enables non-destructive three-dimensional characterization of nano-structured quantum devices. Due to the strong resonances at soft X-ray wavelengths, the technique is also ideally suited to characterize layered quantum materials, such as cuprates or the topical infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations, mixed states and bistability at the onset of lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a model for a single mode laser that includes all two particle quantum correlations between photons and electrons. In contrast to the predictions of semi-classical models, we find that lasing takes place in the presence of quantum bistability between a non-lasing and a non-classical coherent state. The coherent state is characterized by a central frequency and a finite linewidth and emerges with finite amplitude from a saddle-node bifurcation together with an unstable coherent state. Hence coherent emission in nanolasers originates through a mixing of lasing and non-lasing states. In the limit of a macrolaser with a large number of emitters and non-resonant modes, the laser threshold approaches the prediction of the semi-classical theory, but with the important difference that lasing can be achieved only in the presence of finite size perturbations.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism for a Quenched Quantum Inverted Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-dependent behaviour of quantum correlations of a system of an inverted oscillator governed by out-of-equilibrium dynamics using the well-known Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in presence of quantum mechanical quench. Considering a generalized structure of a time-dependent Hamiltonian for an inverted oscillator system, we use the invariant operator method to obtain its eigenstates and continuous energy eigenvalues. Using the expression for the eigenstates, we further derive the most general expression for the generating function as well as the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) for the given system using this formalism. Further, considering the time-dependent coupling and frequency of the quantum inverted oscillator characterized by quench parameters, we comment on the dynamical behaviour, specifically the early, intermediate and late time-dependent features of the OTOC for the quenched quantum inverted oscillator. Next, we study a specific case, where the system of inverted oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviour by computing the quantum Lyapunov exponent from the time-dependent behaviour of OTOC in presence of the given quench profile.</description>

      <title>Thermal Purcell effect and cavity-induced renormalization of dissipations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been great interest towards optical cavities as a tool to manipulate the properties and phases of embedded quantum materials. Due to the Purcell effect, a cavity changes the photon phase space and thus the rate of electromagnetic transitions within the material, modifying the exchange rate of heat radiation with the photon environment. Here, I derive a simple expression for the radiative heat power absorbed by the material, investigate how it changes in the presence of a cavity and show that it is enhanced dramatically for appropriate cavity geometries. I compare this effect with typical energy dissipation processes, provide a criterion to establish its impact on the temperature of a material coupled to the cavity and apply it to 1T-TaS$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of weak static perturbations of a flat potential on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas. {We consider the perturbative effects of potential perturbations at first order and restrict to the mean-field stable regime. We first study cosinusoidal potential perturbations at a given spatial frequency; this allows us to understand the effects of optical lattices as well as of isolated momentum contributions in the Fourier decomposition of an arbitrary potential. We then study potential perturbations characterized by a static white-noise spectrum over a given momentum range; this captures the effects of inherent optical aberrations in setups that create uniform optical dipole traps.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bounce solutions and associated negative modes in the class of piecewise linear triangular-shaped potentials that may be viewed as approximations of smooth potentials. In these simple potentials, the bounce solution and action can be obtained analytically for a general spacetime dimension $D$. The eigenequations for the fluctuations around the bounce are universal and have the form of a Schr\"odinger-like equation with delta-function potentials. This Schr\"odinger equation is solved exactly for the negative modes whose number is confirmed to be one. The latter result may justify the usefulness of such piecewise linear potentials in the study of false vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Energy change and Landauer's principle in the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and anti-Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a "temperature", which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove that Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy are generalizations of the entanglement entropy that involve post-selection. In this work we analyze their properties as measures on the spaces of quantum states and argue that their excess provides useful characterization of a difference between two (i.e. pre-selected and post-selected) states, which shares certain features and in certain cases can be identified as a metric. In particular, when applied to link complement states that are associated to topological links via Chern-Simons theory, these generalized entropies and their excess provide a novel quantification of a difference between corresponding links. We discuss the dependence of such entropy measures on the level of Chern-Simons theory and determine their asymptotic values for certain link states. We find that imaginary part of the pseudo-entropy is sensitive to, and can diagnose chirality of knots. We also consider properties of these entropy measures for simpler quantum mechanical systems, such as generalized SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states, and tripartite GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the fields of quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of &lt;1% at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. To achieve both spin channels in $\pi$-diradicals, we leverage on weaker spin-orbit couplings beyond the nearest-neighbour approximation, made possible by careful control of orbital nodal structures and group-theoretical considerations. These analyses are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around 30% under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings during electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>
