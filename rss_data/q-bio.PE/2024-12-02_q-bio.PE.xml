      <title>Multistage spatial model for informing release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes as disease control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolbachia is a naturally occurring bacterium that can infect Aedes mosquitoes and reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials have been conducted worldwide to suppress local epidemics. We introduce a novel partial differential equation model to simulate the spread of Wolbachia infection in mosquito populations. Our model incorporates the intricate Wolbachia maternal transmission cycle and detailed mosquito life stages, while also accounting for the spatial heterogeneity induced by mosquito dispersion across a two-dimensional domain. Prior modeling studies and field data indicate that a critical threshold of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes is necessary for infection to persist among the mosquito population. Through our spatial model, we identify a threshold condition, termed the ``critical bubble'', for having a self-sustainable Wolbachia infection in the field. When releasing beyond this threshold, the model predicts a spatial wave of Wolbachia infection. We further quantify how this threshold and infection wave velocity depend on the diffusion process and other parameters. We numerically study various intervention scenarios to inform efficient Wolbachia release strategies. Our findings suggest that: (1) integrating Wolbachia release with pre-release mitigations targeting the adult mosquitoes, rather than the aquatic stages, better reduces the threshold for Wolbachia establishment; Habitats modification before the release may increase the threshold; (2) releases in the dry regions lower the threshold, though the infection waves may slow down or stall at the dry-wet interfaces due to the difference in carrying capacities; and (3) initiating releases just before the wet season further reduces the release threshold.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics in the global coral symbiont network under temperature variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coral reefs are crucial to marine biodiversity and rely on a delicate symbiotic relationship between corals and zooxanthellae algae. Water temperature variations, however, disrupt this association, leading to coral bleaching events that severely affect marine ecosystems. This study presents a mathematical model for the population dynamics of coral and symbiont species considering the coral symbiont network and recurrent warming events. The model incorporates thermal tolerances of species and coupled growth dynamics (between corals and symbionts) to investigate how network structure and thermal tolerance influence the species' growth. Using real data from different ocean regions, results reveal that network connectivity plays a significant role in population growth after successive warming events, with generalist species demonstrating greater growth across all regions analyzed. The comparatively higher correlation between node degree and final population also emphasizes the impact of ecological network structure on species growth, offering valuable insights into coral reef population dynamics under climate change. This research highlights the need to consider network structure beyond species' thermal tolerances when evaluating the ecological responses of corals to environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Modelling plausible scenarios for the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant from early-stage surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We used a spatially explicit agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission combined with spatially fine-grained COVID-19 observation data from Public Health Scotland to investigate the initial rise of the Omicron (BA.1) variant of concern. We evaluated plausible scenarios for transmission rate advantage and vaccine immune escape relative to the Delta variant based on the data that would have been available at that time. We also explored possible outcomes of different levels of imposed non-pharmaceutical intervention. The initial results of these scenarios were used to inform the Scottish Government in the early outbreak stages of the Omicron variant.
  Using the model with parameters fit over the Delta variant epidemic, some initial assumptions about Omicron transmission rate advantage and vaccine escape, and a simple growth rate fitting procedure, we were able to capture the initial outbreak dynamics for Omicron. We found that the modelled dynamics hold up to retrospective scrutiny. The modelled imposition of extra non-pharmaceutical interventions planned by the Scottish Government at the time would likely have little effect in light of the transmission rate advantage held by the Omicron variant and the fact that the planned interventions would have occurred too late in the outbreak's trajectory. Finally, we found that any assumptions made about the projected distribution of vaccines in the model population had little bearing on the outcome, in terms of outbreak size and timing. Instead, it was the landscape of prior immunity that was most important.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Stochastic Importation Dynamics and Establishment of Novel Pathogenic Strains using a General Branching Processes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importation and subsequent establishment of novel pathogenic strains in a population is subject to a large degree of uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Mathematical models need to take this stochasticity in the early phase of an outbreak in order to adequately capture the uncertainty in disease forecasts. We propose a general branching process model of disease spread that includes host-level heterogeneity, and that can be straightforwardly tailored to capture the salient aspects of a particular disease outbreak. We combine this with a model of case importation that occurs via an independent marked Poisson process. We use this framework to investigate the impact of different control strategies, particularly on the time to establishment of an invading, exogenous strain, using parameters taken from the literature for COVID-19 as an example. We also demonstrate how to combine our model with a deterministic approximation, such that longer term projections can be generated that still incorporate the uncertainty from the early growth phase of the epidemic. Our approach produces meaningful short- and medium-term projections of the course of a disease outbreak when model parameters are still uncertain and when stochasticity still has a large effect on the population dynamics.</description>
