      <title>Adaptation of Wallace's Approach to the Specific Heat of Elemental Solids with Significant Intrinsic Anharmonicity, Particularly the Light Actinide Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasiharmonic approximation is the most common method for modeling the specific heat of solids; however, it fails to capture the effects of intrinsic anharmonicity in phonons. In this study, we introduce the "elastic softening approximation," an alternative approach to modelling intrinsic anharmonic effects on thermodynamic quantities which is grounded in Wallace's thermodynamic framework (Thermodynamics of Crystals, 1972) and focused on tracking entropy changes due to the continuous softening of phonons as a function of temperature. A key finding of our study is a direct correlation between Poisson's ratio and the differential rate of phonon softening at finite frequencies, compared to lower frequencies relevant to elastic moduli measurements. We observe that elemental solids such as alpha-Be, diamond, Al, Cu, In, W, Au, and Pb, which span a wide range of Poisson's ratios and exhibit varying degrees of intrinsic anharmonicity, consistently follow this trend. When applied to alpha-U, alpha-Pu, and delta-Pu, our method reveals unusually large anharmonic phonon contributions at elevated temperatures across all three light actinide metals. These findings are attributed to the unique combination of enhanced covalency and softer elastic moduli inherent in the actinides, potentially influenced by their 5f-electron bonding.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Coupling Breaks Energy Symmetry in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors are extensively studied for applications ranging from bioelectronics to analog and neuromorphic computing. Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored. Here, we examine the coupling between the benchmark semiconductor PEDOT:PSS and ionic liquids to explain the bistable and non-volatile behavior observed in OECTs. Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the electronic and energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct, stable states, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight a compelling method to control charge carrier dynamics via the electrolyte, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized tool for enabling novel device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Consequences of magneto-electrical coupling in multiferroic VSe$_{2}$$/$Sc$_{2}$CO$_{2}$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures are potential game changers both in understanding the fundamental physics and in the realization of various devices that exploit magnetism at the nanoscale. Multiferroic heterostructures comprising a two-dimensional ferroelectric and a two-dimensional ferromagnet are ideal candidates for electrical control of properties of the ferromagnets that can lead to non-volatile memory devices, for example. Relatively new but immensely promising two-dimensional materials, MXene and transition metal dichalcogenides, can be effectively combined to achieve the goal as both have flexibilities in their structures and compositions that are tunable. In this work, using Density Functional Theory, we have investigated the magneto-electric coupling driven transitions in the electronic ground states of VSe$_{2}$-Sc$_{2}$CO$_{2}$ bi-layer and tri-layer heterostructures. Our results demonstrate that the change in the ferroelectric polarisation in the MXene layer leads to changes in the spin-polarized band structures of the magnetic component VSe$_{2}$ enabling a semiconductor to half-metal transition in these heterostructures. We propose several applications of this magneto-electric coupling in these multiferroic heterostructures that can lead to the efficient operation of Field Effect transistors and achieve non-volatility in memory devices at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Colossal terahertz emission with ultrafast tunability based on van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology is critical for quantum material physics, biomedical imaging, ultrafast electronics, and next-generation wireless communications. However, standing in the way of widespread applications is the scarcity of efficient ultrafast THz sources with on-demand fast modulation and easy on-chip integration capability. Here we report the discovery of colossal THz emission from a van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI$_2$. Using THz emission spectroscopy, we observe a THz generation efficiency an order of magnitude higher than that of ZnTe, a standard nonlinear crystal for ultrafast THz generation. We further uncover the underlying generation mechanisms associated with its large ferroelectric polarization by studying the THz emission dependence on excitation wavelength, incident polarization and fluence. Moreover, we demonstrate the ultrafast coherent amplification and annihilation of the THz emission and associated coherent phonon oscillations by employing a double-pump scheme. These findings combined with first-principles calculations, inform new understanding of the THz light-matter interaction in emergent vdW ferroelectrics and pave the way to develop high-performance THz devices on them for quantum materials sensing and ultrafast electronics.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Accelerated Surface Exploration of Reconstructed BiVO$_{4}$(010) and Characterization of Their Aqueous Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the semiconductor-electrolyte interface in photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems is crucial for optimizing stability and reactivity. Despite the challenges in establishing reliable surface structure models during PEC cycles, this study explores the complex surface reconstructions of BiVO$_{4}$(010) by employing a computational workflow integrated with a state-of-the-art active learning protocol for a machine-learning interatomic potential and global optimization techniques. Within this workflow, we identified 494 unique reconstructed surface structures that surpass conventional chemical intuition-driven, bulk-truncated models. After constructing the surface Pourbaix diagram under Bi- and V-rich electrolyte conditions using density functional theory and hybrid functional calculations, we proposed structural models for the experimentally observed Bi-rich BiVO$_{4}$ surfaces. By performing hybrid functional molecular dynamics simulations with explicit treatment of water molecules on selected reconstructed BiVO$_{4}$(010) surfaces, we observed spontaneous water dissociation, marking the first theoretical report of this phenomenon. Our findings demonstrate significant water dissociation on reconstructed Bi-rich surfaces, highlighting the critical role of bare and under-coordinated Bi sites (only observable in reconstructed surfaces) in driving hydration processes. Our work establishes a foundation for understanding the role of complex, reconstructed Bi surfaces in surface hydration and reactivity. Additionally, our theoretical framework for exploring surface structures and predicting reactivity in multicomponent oxides offers a precise approach to describing complex surface and interface processes in PEC systems.</description>

      <title>1D Kinetic Energy Density Functionals learned with Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory promises to deliver linear-scaling electronic structure calculations. This requires the knowledge of the non-interacting kinetic-energy density functional (KEDF), which should be accurate and must admit accurate functional derivatives, so that a minimization procedure can be designed. In this work, symbolic regression is explored as an alternative means to machine-learn the KEDF, which results into analytical expressions, whose functional derivatives are easy to compute. The so-determined semi-local functional forms are investigated as a function of the electron number, and we are able to track the transition from the von Weizs\"acker functional, exact for the one-electron case, to the Thomas-Fermi functional, exact in the homogeneous electron gas limit. A number of separate searches are performed, ranging from totally unconstrained to constrained in the form of an enhancement factor. This work highlights the complexity in constructing semi-local approximations of the KEDF and the potential of symbolic regression to advance the search.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical heat flow in passive chiral solids is third rank, not odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral, directionally isotropic gyroid lattices are observed to exhibit nonclassical thermal effects incompatible with an asymmetric (``odd'') second rank conductivity tensor but consistent with a third rank tensor property that provides a curl term. The lattices are passive materials so no driving torques are needed to obtain transverse flow. A method for determination of the length scale associated with chirality is provided. The polymer gyroid lattice made by 3D printing is a metamaterial which allows chirality that is tunable by geometry.</description>

      <title>A phenomenological magnetomechanical model for hysteresis loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a simple phenomenological model for magnetization curves of stressed samples. The magnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the arctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. Despite of its simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves, reproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization curves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops. The popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a simple scaling of the magnetic field. By introducing a small increase in the maximum magnetization a Villary reversal point can be also modelled. Reducing the complex effect of stress to a single-parameter scaling of the magnetization function argument can greatly simplify analysis and understanding of the effect of stress on the magnetization curves. We show that the differential susceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all magnetization values.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Strong Orbital Moments in Perpendicularly Magnetized Magnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balance between the orbital and spin magnetic moments in a magnetic system is the heart of many intriguing phenomena. Here, we show experimental evidence of a large orbital moment, which competes with its spin counterpart in a ferrimagnetic insulator thulium iron garnet, Tm3Fe5O12. Leveraging element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), we establish that the dominant contribution to the orbital moment originates from 4f orbitals of Tm. Besides the large Tm orbital moment, intriguingly, our results also reveal a smaller but evident non-zero XMCD signal in the O K edge, suggesting additional spin-orbit coupling and exchange interactions with the nearest neighbour Fe atoms. The unquenched orbital moment is primarily responsible for a significant reduction in g-factor, typically 2 in transition metals, as determined independently using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our findings reveal a non-linear reduction in the g-factor from 1.7 at 300 K to 1.56 at 200 K in Tm3Fe5O12 thin films. These results provide critical insights into the role of the f orbitals in long-range magnetic order and stimulate further exploration in orbitronics.</description>

      <title>High-temperature Phonon Coherence and Tunneling Effect in Semiconductor Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons, the quanta of lattice vibrations, are primary heat carriers for semiconductors and dielectrics. The demand of effective phonon manipulation urgently emerges, because the thermal management is crucial for the ongoing development of micro/nano semiconductor devices towards higher integration and power densities1, 2. Phonons also show wave-particle duality, while they are commonly treated as particle flows in current semiconductor structures3, 4. However, it sees constraints when the structure size reduces to nano and atomic scales, where the wave behavior of phonons begins to dominate, and studies of these phonon behaviors and their manipulations become long-standing challenges in experiments5. Here we show the experimental realization of coherent phonon transport, a wave-based thermal conduction fashion, in semiconductor structures. We report the successful observation of robust phonon coherence and tunneling effect in InAs/AlAs superlattices over an extensive temperature range up to 500 K, a breakthrough towards practical-application temperature for semiconductors compared with cryogenic conditions6. Our results demonstrate that the phonon coherence is robust even at a record-high interface density due to the dominating long-wavelength phonons, and the first-principles calculations clearly reveal their wave-particle duality. This revelation heralds a promising pathway towards efficient thermal phonon engineering at extreme scales, holding implications for a broad spectrum of semiconductor device applications, including microelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>High-order AMR in two-dimensional magnetic monolayers from spin mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is a well-known magnetoelectric coupling phenomenon, commonly exhibiting two-fold symmetry relative to the magnetic field. In this study, we reveal the existence of high-order AMRs in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic monolayers. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe3GeTe2 and CrTe2 monolayers, we find that different energy bands contribute uniquely to AMR behavior. The high-order AMR is attributed to strong spin mixing at band crossing points, which induces significant Berry curvature. This curvature also contributes to the AMR for electrons with dominant spin-up or spin-down polarization characteristics. However, for electrons exhibiting strong spin mixing, the Berry curvature effect becomes nontrivial, resulting in high-order AMR. Our findings provide an effective approach to identifying and optimizing materials with high-order AMR, which is critical for designing high-performance spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of {\it virtual} topological states -- topological phases away from the Fermi energy -- against the electron-electron interaction and band filling. As a case study, we employ a realistic model to investigate the properties of vacancy-driven topological phases in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and establish a connection between the degree of localization of topological wave functions, the vacancy density, and the electron-electron interaction strength with the topological phase robustness. We demonstrate that electron-electron interactions play a crucial role in degrading topological phases thereby determining the validity of single-particle approximations for topological insulator phases. Our findings can be naturally extended to virtual topological phases of a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Doping-Induced Charge Density Wave and Ferromagnetism in the Van der Waals Semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials with one-dimensional electronic bands, electron-electron interactions can produce intriguing quantum phenomena, including spin-charge separation and charge density waves (CDW). Most of these systems, however, are non-magnetic, motivating a search for anisotropic materials where the coupling of charge and spin may affect emergent quantum states. Here, electron doping the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr induces an electronically driven quasi-1D CDW, which survives above room temperature. Lithium intercalation also increases the magnetic ordering temperature to 200 K and changes its interlayer magnetic coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. The spin-polarized nature of the anisotropic bands that give rise to this CDW enforces an intrinsic coupling of charge and spin. The coexistence and interplay of ferromagnetism and charge modulation in this exfoliatable material provides a promising platform for studying tunable quantum phenomena across a range of temperatures and thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Gold diamond Nanocomposites Efficiently Generate Hydrated Electrons upon Absorption of Visible Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient source of hydrated electrons generated by visible light has the potential to have a major impact on solar homogeneous catalysis. Diamond has potentially a high capability of emitting hydrated electrons, but only using ultraviolet light (lambda&lt;225 nm). In this work, we demonstrate the efficient absorption of visible light by nanocomposites consisting of detonation nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles (AuNP@DNDs), which subsequently emit electrons into the aqueous environment in which they are suspended. This has been done by exciting the AuNP@DND with visible laser light and monitoring the appearance and intensity of the transient absorption of hydrated electrons centered at around 720 nm. We suggest that this mechanism is made possible by the plasmonic enhancement of visible absorption by sp2-hybridized islands on the DND surface. Optimization of this process could lead to important breakthroughs in solar photocatalysis of energy-intensive reactions such as N2 and CO2 reduction as well as providing a non-toxic source of hydrated electrons for applications in wastewater management and nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hydrodynamics Meets Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of quantum-hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations from the Wigner distribution function. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra. Additionally, we examine the role of the quantum potential, interpreted as a gradient correction to the Thomas--Fermi kinetic energy. Our results provide new insights into quantum effects in plasmonic systems, with significant implications for future advances in nanophotonics through the lens of hydrodynamic theory.</description>

      <title>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3D topological insulator (TI) is wrapped by a metallic surface that is topologically protected. While this surface is promising for generating non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) for topological quantum computing, it is a challenge to gap out the whole surface to get rid of low-energy quasiparticles to realize a well-defined fermion parity. Here we propose a novel TI platform that solves this problem and gives rise to a robust topological phase. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of the axial magnetic field with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$ and can be tuned by a back gate to attain vanishing $I_c$ minima, an indication that the supercurrent is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>

      <title>Larger grains in high-Tc superconductors synthesized by the solid-state reaction route</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state synthesis is widely used in exploratory research to study various structural modifications that affect the properties (critical temperature, critical current density, irreversibility field, etc.) of superconductors. The popularity of this method is due to its relative simplicity and availability of the necessary equipment. Combining solid-state synthesis and top-seeded melt growth allows us to increase the grain size in a Tm- and Nd-based 1-2-3 superconductor. Samples with a grain size up to 0.1 mm have been obtained. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and magnetization measurements have been used for investigating this superconducting material. The magnetization width {\Delta}M has increased significantly in the synthesized samples. However the temperature dependence of the intragrain critical current density and the pinning force scaling give evidences that the pinning mechanism in the obtained superconductor is essentially the same as in polycrystalline superconductors synthesized by standard solid-state technology. The increase in grain size in the synthesized samples is the main reason for the high values of {\Delta}M.</description>

      <title>A computational framework to predict weld integrity and microstructural heterogeneity: application to hydrogen transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel computational framework to assess the structural integrity of welds. In the first stage of the simulation framework, local fractions of microstructural constituents within weld regions are predicted based on steel composition and welding parameters. The resulting phase fraction maps are used to define heterogeneous properties that are subsequently employed in structural integrity assessments using an elastoplastic phase field fracture model. The framework is particularised to predicting failure in hydrogen pipelines, demonstrating its potential to assess the feasibility of repurposing existing pipeline infrastructure to transport hydrogen. First, the process model is validated against experimental microhardness maps for vintage and modern pipeline welds. Additionally, the influence of welding conditions on hardness and residual stresses is investigated, demonstrating that variations in heat input, filler material composition, and weld bead order can significantly affect the properties within the weld region. Coupled hydrogen diffusion-fracture simulations are then conducted to determine the critical pressure at which hydrogen transport pipelines will fail. To this end, the model is enriched with a microstructure-sensitive description of hydrogen transport and hydrogen-dependent fracture resistance. The analysis of an X52 pipeline reveals that even 2 mm defects in a hard heat-affected zone can drastically reduce the critical failure pressure.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of orbital torque, pumping and mixing conductance in metallic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion between spin and orbital currents is at the origin of the orbital torque and its Onsager reciprocal, the orbital pumping. Here, we propose a phenomenological model to describe the orbital torque in magnetic bilayers composed of an orbital source (i.e., a light metal such as Ti, Ru, CuOx...) and a spin-orbit coupled magnet (i.e., typically Ni, (Co/Pt)$_n$, etc.). This approach accounts for spin-to-orbit and orbit-to-spin conversion in the ferromagnet and at the interface. We show that the orbital torque arises from a compromise between orbital current injection from the orbital source to the ferromagnet and spin current backflow from the ferromagnet back to the orbital source. We also discuss the concept of orbital-mixing conductance and introduce the "orbit-spin-" and "spin-orbit-mixing" conductances that govern the orbital torque and orbital pumping, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer composite performance depends significantly on the polymer matrix, additives, processing conditions, and measurement setups. Traditional physics-based optimization methods for these parameters can be slow, labor-intensive, and costly, as they require physical manufacturing and testing. Here, we introduce a first step in extending Polymer Informatics, an AI-based approach proven effective for neat polymer design, into the realm of polymer composites. We curate a comprehensive database of commercially available polymer composites, develop a scheme for machine-readable data representation, and train machine-learning models for 15 flame-resistant, mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, validating them on entirely unseen data. Future advancements are planned to drive the AI-assisted design of functional and sustainable polymer composites.</description>

      <title>Evidence for multiband gapless superconductivity in the topological superconductor candidate 4Hb-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on single crystals of transition-metal dichalcogenide material 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$, which has recently been proposed as a topological superconductor candidate. In zero field, a small residual linear term $\kappa_{0}/T$ is observed, indicating the existence of a residual density of states in the superconducting state. The slow field dependence of $\kappa_{0}/T$ at low fields rules out the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap, and the S-shaped field dependence across the full field range suggests multiple superconducting gaps in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$. Our results provide evidence for multiband gapless superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$, and the residual density of states come from certain gapless Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Matbench Discovery -- A framework to evaluate machine learning crystal stability predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) in domain sciences necessitates best practices and standardized benchmarking for performance evaluation. We present Matbench Discovery, an evaluation framework for ML energy models, applied as pre-filters for high-throughput searches of stable inorganic crystals. This framework addresses the disconnect between thermodynamic stability and formation energy, as well as retrospective vs. prospective benchmarking in materials discovery. We release a Python package to support model submissions and maintain an online leaderboard, offering insights into performance trade-offs. To identify the best-performing ML methodologies for materials discovery, we benchmarked various approaches, including random forests, graph neural networks (GNNs), one-shot predictors, iterative Bayesian optimizers, and universal interatomic potentials (UIP). Our initial results rank models by test set F1 scores for thermodynamic stability prediction: EquiformerV2 + DeNS &gt; Orb &gt; SevenNet &gt; MACE &gt; CHGNet &gt; M3GNet &gt; ALIGNN &gt; MEGNet &gt; CGCNN &gt; CGCNN+P &gt; Wrenformer &gt; BOWSR &gt; Voronoi fingerprint random forest. UIPs emerge as the top performers, achieving F1 scores of 0.57-0.82 and discovery acceleration factors (DAF) of up to 6x on the first 10k stable predictions compared to random selection. We also identify a misalignment between regression metrics and task-relevant classification metrics. Accurate regressors can yield high false-positive rates near the decision boundary at 0 eV/atom above the convex hull. Our results demonstrate UIPs' ability to optimize computational budget allocation for expanding materials databases. However, their limitations remain underexplored in traditional benchmarks. We advocate for task-based evaluation frameworks, as implemented here, to address these limitations and advance ML-guided materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: Ionic conductors have great potential for interesting tunable physical properties via ionic liquid gating and novel energy storage applications such as all-solid-state lithium batteries. In particular, low migration barriers and high hopping attempt frequency are the keys to achieve fast ion diffusion in solids. Taking advantage of the oxygen-vacancy channel in $\mathrm{Li}_{x}\mathrm{{Sr}_{2}{Co}_{2}{O}_{5}}$, we show that migration barriers of lithium ion are as small as 0.28~0.17eV depending on the lithium concentration rates. Our first-principles calculation also investigated hopping attempt frequency and concluded the room temperature ionic diffusivity and ion conductivity is high as ${10}^{-7}\sim{10}^{-6}~\mathrm{{cm}^{2}~s^{-1}}$ and ${10}^{-3}\sim{10}^{-2}~\mathrm{S\cdot{cm}^{-1}}$ respectively, which outperform most of perovskite-type, garnet-type and sulfide Li-ion solid-state electrolytes. This work proves $\mathrm{Li}_{x}\mathrm{{Sr}_{2}{Co}_{2}{O}_{5}}$ as a promising super-ionic conductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doped semiconductors can exhibit metallic-like properties ranging from superconductivity to tunable localized surface plasmon resonances. Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low-energy excitations is provided by valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and near-field infrared spectroscopy. The measured spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Our calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a crossover characteristic of metallicity. These results suggest a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in doped semiconductors, and the possibility of attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for quantum information technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, the ideal shear strength ({\tau}_is) of dilute Ni34XZ ternary alloys (X or Z = Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Si, Ti) are predicted by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in terms of pure alias shear deformations. The {\tau}_is results show that within the concentration up to 8.3% of alloying elements, {\tau}_is increases with composition in binary systems with Mn, Fe, and Co in ascending order, and decreases with composition with Nb, Si, Mo, Ti, Al, and Cr in descending order. The composition dependence of {\tau}_is in binary and ternary systems is modeled using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach considering lattice instability, indicating that atomic bonding strength significantly influences {\tau}_is. Correlational analyses further show that lattice constant and elastic constant C11 affect {\tau}_is, the most out of the elemental features.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Multi-material Classification of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Atomic Force Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for the data-driven design of materials based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other scanning probe microscopy. These tools enhance efficiency in inverse design and characterization of materials. However, limited and imbalanced experimental materials data typically available is a major challenge. Also important is the need to interpret trained models, which have typically been complex enough to be uninterpretable by humans. Here, we present a systemic evaluation of transfer learning strategies to accommodate low-data scenarios in materials synthesis and a model latent feature analysis to draw connections to the human-interpretable characteristics of the samples. Our models show accurate predictions in five classes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and Mo-WSe$_2$) with up to 89$\%$ accuracy on held-out test samples. Analysis of the latent features reveals a correlation with physical characteristics such as grain density, DoG blob, and local variation. The transfer learning optimization modality and the exploration of the correlation between the latent and physical features provide important frameworks that can be applied to other classes of materials beyond TMDs to enhance the models' performance and explainability which can accelerate the inverse design of materials for technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cutting-edge experiments have provided {\it in situ} structure characterization and measurements of the pressure ($P$), density ($\bar{\rho}$) and temperature ($T$) of shock compressed silicon in the 100 GPa range of pressures and upto $\sim$10,000K. We present first-principles calculations in this $P,T,\bar{\rho}$ regime to reveal a plethora of novel liquid-liquid phase transitions (LPTs) identifiable via discontinuities in the pressure and the compressibility. Evidence for the presence of a highly-correlated liquid (CL) phase, as well as a normal-liquid (NL) phase at the LPTs is presented by a detailed study of one LPT. The LPTs make the interpretation of these experiments more challenging. The LPTs preserve the short-ranged ionic structure of the fluid by collective adjustments of many distant atoms when subject to compression and heating, with minimal change in the ion-ion pair-distribution functions, and in transport properties such as the electrical and thermal conductivities $\sigma$ and $\kappa$. We match the experimental X-Ray Thomson scattering and X-ray diffraction data theoretically, and provide pressure isotherms, ionization data and compressibilities that support the above picture of liquid silicon as a highly complex LPT-driven ``glassy'' metallic liquid. These novel results are relevant to materials research, studies of planetary interiors, high-energy-density physics, and in laser-fusion studies.</description>

In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to investigate and model material interface diffusion. We begin by collecting experimental and simulated data on diffusion coefficients, concentration gradients, and other relevant parameters from diverse material systems. The data are preprocessed, and key features influencing interface diffusion are extracted. Subsequently, we construct a GNN model tailored to the diffusion problem, with a graph representation capturing the atomic structure of materials. The model architecture includes multiple graph convolutional layers for feature aggregation and update, as well as optional graph attention layers to capture complex relationships between atoms. We train and validate the GNN model using the preprocessed data, achieving accurate predictions of diffusion coefficients, diffusion rates, concentration profiles, and potential diffusion pathways. Our approach offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of interface diffusion and provides a valuable tool for optimizing material design and engineering. Additionally, our method offers possible strategies to solve the longstanding problems related to materials interface diffusion.</description>

      <title>Evolution of flat bands in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ moir\'e lattices: A study combining machine learning and band unfolding methods</title>

Abstract: Moir\'e lattices have served as the ideal quantum simulation platform for exploring novel physics due to the flat electronic bands resulting from the long wavelength moir\'e potentials. However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</description>

      <title>A note on thermomechanical coupling effects in the indentation of pseudoelastic shape memory alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While macroscopic experiments on polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMAs) reveal significant thermomechanical coupling effects arising from the latent heat of transformation, the relevance of thermomechanical couplings in indentation tests remains ambiguous. This ambiguity is further emphasized by the rate effects observed in a number of micro/nano-indentation experiments, thus highlighting the need for a more careful investigation of the thermomechanical interactions at such small scales. With this in mind, the present study aims to demonstrate the role of thermomechanical couplings in indentation-induced martensitic transformation in SMAs. To this end, a simple phenomenological model of pseudoelasticity is employed and finite-element simulations are performed to address two key questions. (1) At which spatial and temporal scales do the thermomechanical couplings arising from the latent heat become effective? (2) To what extent do these couplings influence the indentation response? In connection with the latter, our analysis quantifies the maximal thermal effects that emerge during adiabatic indentation and compares them with those of isothermal indentation.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An unstable orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. Quasi-particle peaks appear at the Fermi level due to an interorbital hopping between the localized ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ and delocalized Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Gate-defined single-electron transistors in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) near the magic angle is a unique platform where the combination of topology and strong correlations gives rise to exotic electronic phases. These phases are gate-tunable and related to the presence of flat electronic bands, isolated by single-particle band gaps. This enables gate-controlled charge confinement, essential for the operation of single-electron transistors (SETs), and allows to explore the interplay of confinement, electron interactions, band renormalisation and the moir\'e superlattice, potentially revealing key paradigms of strong correlations. Here, we present gate-defined SETs in near-magic-angle tBLG with well-tunable Coulomb blockade resonances. These SETs allow to study magnetic field-induced quantum oscillations in the density of states of the source-drain reservoirs, providing insight into gate-tunable Fermi surfaces of tBLG. Comparison with tight-binding calculations highlights the importance of displacement-field-induced band renormalisation crucial for future advanced gate-tunable quantum devices and circuits in tBLG including e.g. quantum dots and Josephson junction arrays.</description>

      <title>All-optical polarization control and routing by nonlinear interferometry at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are rapidly establishing as key-enabling platforms for nanophotonics applications. Along with the ability of taming light in subwavelength thicknesses, they can feature multiple functionalities in one device. The generation and control of light polarization by metasurfaces already provided a route towards ultracompact polarimetry devices in the linear regime. If translated to the nonlinear optical regime it may become a key-enabling tool in nonlinear imaging, optical holography and sensing. Here, we report the experimental ultrafast all-optical polarization modulation of upconverted light by all-dielectric metasurfaces via nonlinear interferometry. By controlling the relative phase between a pump beam at $\omega$ and its frequency-double replica at 2$\omega$, we can set the phase relation between two frequency-degenerate upconverted processes at 3$\omega$ $-$ Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) and Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) $-$ stemming from an AlGaAs metasurface. By exploiting the opposite parity of the two nonlinear process and tuning their relative powers, we can achieve modulation of the polarization states of the light emitted at 3$\omega$ between linear and circular states with a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) up to 83$\%$. In particular, circularly polarized light features opposite handedness symmetrically located in the Fourier space, at coincidence with the first diffraction orders of the metasurface. Moreover, by toggling the phase delay by $\pi$, the handedness can be fully switched between the diffraction. Our work adds an additional layer of modulation in polarization beyond intensity to all-optical routing with precise phase control. The capability to route circular polarization states in the k-space holds significant potential for chiral sensing and advanced imaging techniques.</description>
