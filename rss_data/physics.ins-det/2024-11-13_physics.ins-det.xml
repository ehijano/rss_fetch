      <title>Investigation and optimization of the deconvolution method for PMT waveform reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are extensively employed as photosensors in neutrino and dark matter detection. The precise charge and timing information extracted from the PMT waveform plays a crucial role in energy and vertex reconstruction. In this study, we investigate the deconvolution algorithm utilized for PMT waveform reconstruction, while enhancing the timing separation ability for pile-up hits by redesigning filters based on the time-frequency uncertainty principle. This filter design sacrifices signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve narrower pulse widths. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of signal pulses in the case of low SNR based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Monte Carlo data confirms that our optimization yields enhanced reconstruction performance: improving timing separation ability for pile-up hits from $\sim$10 ns to $3\sim5$ ns, while controlling residual nonlinearity of charge reconstruction within 1\%.</description>

      <title>A fast plastic scintillator for low intensity proton beam monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of particle therapy monitoring, we are developing a gamma-ray detector to determine the ion range in vivo from the measurement of particle time-of-flight. For this application, a beam monitor capable to tag in time the incident ion with a time resolution below 235 ps FWHM (100 ps rms) is required to provide a start signal for the acquisition. We have therefore developed a dedicated detector based on a fast organic scintillator (EJ-204) of 25x25x1 mm3 coupled to four SiPM strips that allow measuring the particle incident position by scintillation light sharing. The prototype was characterised with single protons of energies between 63 and 225 MeV at the MEDICYC and ProteusONE facilities of the Antoine Lacassagne proton therapy centre in Nice. We obtained a time resolution of 120 ps FWHM at 63 MeV, and a spatial resolution of ~2 mm rms for single particles. Two identical detectors also allowed to measure the MEDICYC proton energy with 0.3% accuracy.</description>

      <title>A computer-vision aided Compton-imaging system for radioactive waste characterization and decommissioning of nuclear power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear energy production is inherently tied to the management and disposal of radioactive waste. Enhancing classification and monitoring tools is therefore crucial, with significant socioeconomic implications. This paper reports on the applicability and performance of a high-efficiency, cost-effective and portable Compton camera for detecting and visualizing low- and medium-level radioactive waste from the decommissioning and regular operation of nuclear power plants. The results demonstrate the good performance of Compton imaging for this type of application, both in terms of image resolution and reduced measuring time. A technical readiness level of TRL7 has been thus achieved with this system prototype, as demonstrated with dedicated field measurements carried out at the radioactive-waste disposal plant of El Cabril (Spain) utilizing a pluarility of radioactive-waste drums from decomissioned nuclear power plants. The performance of the system has been enhanced by means of computer-vision techniques in combination with advanced Compton-image reconstruction algorithms based on Maximum-Likelihood Expectation Maximization. Finally, we also show the feasibility of 3D tomographic reconstruction from a series of relatively short measurements around the objects of interest. The potential of this imaging system to enhance nuclear waste management makes it a promising innovation for the nuclear industry.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of the 2.6 m tall two-phase xenon time projection chamber of Xenoscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Xenoscope is a demonstrator for a next-generation xenon-based observatory for astroparticle physics, as proposed by the XLZD (XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN) collaboration. It houses a 2.6 m tall, two-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC), in a cryostat filled with $\sim$ 360 kg of liquid xenon. The main goals of the facility are to demonstrate electron drift in liquid xenon over this distance, to measure the electron cloud transversal and longitudinal diffusion, as well as the optical properties of the medium. In this work, we describe in detail the construction and commissioning of the TPC and report on the observation of light and charge signals with cosmic muons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology for Gravitational Wave Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's General Theory of Relativity predicts that accelerating mass distributions produce gravitational radiation, analogous to electromagnetic radiation from accelerating charges. These gravitational waves have not been directly detected to date, but are expected to open a new window to the Universe in the near future. Suitable telescopes are kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance between quasi free-falling mirrors. Recent advances in quantum metrology may now provide the required sensitivity boost. So-called squeezed light is able to quantum entangle the high-power laser fields in the interferometer arms, and could play a key role in the realization of gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Parallel Imaging System for Very-low Field (50mT) MRI Scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the scanning time of very-low field (VLF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, commonly employed for stroke diagnosis, can enhance patient comfort and operational efficiency. The conventional parallel imaging (PI) technique for high-field MRI should be tailored to apply here, considering the differences in the direction of the main magnetic field and the presence of noise. A VLF-specific PI algorithm and phased-array coil are proposed, marking the first application of PI in VLF MRI. Reconstruction quality is enhanced by denoising undersampled k-space data using a linear-prediction based Kalman filter. Subsequently, the denoised k-space data are nonlinearly mapped from the original space onto a high-dimensional feature space, utilizing a polynomial feature mapping defined nonlinear frame. Frame parameters are calculated using auto-calibration signals (ACS) from the center k-space, and missing phase-encoding lines in the original space are estimated using acquired lines in the feature space. An 8-channel phased-array coil, designed for a vertical main magnetic field, is decoupled using geometric overlap and a low input impedance (LII) preamplifier. Healthy volunteer head imaging experiments using the proposed PI technique exhibit the lowest mean-squared-error (MSE) value and the highest peak-signal-to-noise (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) values compared to two widely used PI methods. The proposed PI technique enables the VLF MRI scanner to achieve similar image quality and a 72.5% improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to fully sampled images while requiring less than 50% of the scan time. We present a PI technique tailored for VLF MRI scanner for the first time, along with potential research direction to achieve greater reduction factor.</description>

      <title>FELIX-MROD, a FELIX-based data acquisition system for the ATLAS Muon Drift Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ATLAS Muon Drift Tube (MDT) ReadOut Drivers (MROD), 204 VME modules that are an essential part of the readout chain of the 1,150 MDT chambers, have been in operation for more than 15 years and are expected to remain in operation until about 2026. In the event of extensive failures the number of spare MROD modules may be insufficient. However, deployment of an adapted version of the Front-End LInk eXchange (FELIX) system, a new component of the ATLAS data acquisition (DAQ) infrastructure, may overcome potential MROD failures. This paper describes the design, functionality and performance of this adapted version, referred to as FELIX-MROD, and the test results of its integration into the ATLAS DAQ system.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Pixel Detectors: Towards a Radiation Hard ASIC with On-Chip Machine Learning in 28 nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detectors at future high energy colliders will face enormous technical challenges. Disentangling the unprecedented numbers of particles expected in each event will require highly granular silicon pixel detectors with billions of readout channels. With event rates as high as 40 MHz, these detectors will generate petabytes of data per second. To enable discovery within strict bandwidth and latency constraints, future trackers must be capable of fast, power efficient, and radiation hard data-reduction at the source. We are developing a radiation hard readout integrated circuit (ROIC) in 28nm CMOS with on-chip machine learning (ML) for future intelligent pixel detectors. We will show track parameter predictions using a neural network within a single layer of silicon and hardware tests on the first tape-outs produced with TSMC. Preliminary results indicate that reading out featurized clusters from particles above a modest momentum threshold could enable using pixel information at 40 MHz.</description>

      <title>Towards Flexible Intensity Control of Resonantly Scattered $\gamma$-Rays Using Multi-Frequency Vibrating Resonant Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a method for coherent control of $\gamma$-photons, enabling the shaping of $\gamma$-ray intensity in nearly arbitrary waveforms. Different intensity waveforms are created by adjusting the motion profile of a resonant absorber (an ensemble of M\"{o}ssbauer nuclei) and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this method is the use of a low fundamental frequency of vibrations, which broadens the possibilities for $\gamma$-ray control. The results of numerical simulations are experimentally validated by generating single and double $\gamma$-pulses and inducing short-term absorption. For this, a resonant absorber containing $^{57}$Fe nuclei was vibrated with different motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with a fundamental frequency of 1\,MHz. The proposed technique represents an advancement in the manipulation of $\gamma$-rays and potentially X-rays, paving the way for the performance of new types of $\gamma$-ray or X-ray quantum experiments and the development of new tools such as adjustable tabletop $\gamma$-pulse sources or $\gamma$-ray or X-ray delays and gates. Moreover, inverse application of the method enables the measurement of displacements at the picometer level.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost, Low-Power Media Converter Solution for Next-Generation Detector Readout Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Energy Physics (HEP) data acquisition systems are often built from high-end FPGAs. As such systems scale in the HL-LHC era, severe under-utilization of FPGA transceivers can occur because front-end links prioritize radiation hardness and power consumption over raw data bandwidth. This work evaluates recently introduced low-power, low-cost FPGA devices as an alternative building block for future readout architectures. This study presents the implementation of a readout back-End on FPGA where the front-end protocol is based on the Low-Power GigaBit Transceiver (lpGBT) and the readout protocol is based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet, using the LHCb Run 4 RICH detector as a practical case study.</description>
