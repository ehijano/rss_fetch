      <title>Real time detection of C reactive protein in interstitial fluid using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, towards wearable health monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional detection methods of C-reactive protein (CRP) inflammation biomarker, in blood are expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive. Such existing point-of-care CRP detection devices remain invasive, since they need blood sampling (finger-pricking or venous puncture). Here, we propose an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-based sensor for the real-time, fast, specific, sensitive, and label-free detection of C-reactive protein in the interstitial fluid (ISF) that can be accessed with minimally invasive microneedle arrays. The sensor has the potential to be integrated in a wearable device similar with the continuous glucose monitoring, that will detect CRP in interstitial fluid in a non-invasive, inexpensive and straightforward manner. The affinity based assay was tested in both buffer and ISF-like solution. The limit of detection achieved was 0.7 ug/mL of CRP in buffer, and 0.8 ug/mL of CRP in ISF-like solution and the sensor shows excellent linearity up to 10 ug/mL. It is worth noting that the proposed sensor operates in low sample volume (down to 5 uL), and has a response time of 100 seconds.</description>

      <title>Quantifying variabilities in cardiac digital twin models of the electrocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17146v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) of human cardiac electrophysiology (EP) are digital replicas of patient hearts that match like-for-like clinical observations. The electrocardiogram (ECG), as the most prevalent non-invasive observation of cardiac electrophysiology, is considered an ideal target for CDT calibration. Recent advanced CDT calibration methods have demonstrated their ability to minimize discrepancies between simulated and measured ECG signals, effectively replicating all key morphological features relevant to diagnostics. However, due to the inherent nature of clinical data acquisition and CDT model generation pipelines, discrepancies inevitably arise between the real physical electrophysiology in a patient and the simulated virtual electrophysiology in a CDT. In this study, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the impact of these uncertainties on ECG morphology and diagnostic markers. We analyze residual beat-to-beat variability in ECG recordings obtained from healthy subjects and patients. Using a biophysically detailed and anatomically accurate computational model of whole-heart electrophysiology combined with a detailed torso model calibrated to closely replicate measured ECG signals, we vary anatomical factors (heart location, orientation, size), heterogeneity in electrical conductivities in the heart and torso, and electrode placements across ECG leads to assess their qualitative impact on ECG morphology. Our study demonstrates that diagnostically relevant ECG features and overall morphology appear relatively robust against the investigated uncertainties. This resilience is consistent with the narrow distribution of ECG due to residual beat-to-beat variability observed in both healthy subjects and patients.</description>
