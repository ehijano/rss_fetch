      <title>The Dirac and Rarita-Schwinger equations on scalar flat metrics of Taub-NUT type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a scalar flat metric of Taub-NUT type whose total mass can be negative. The standard Taub-NUT metric and its negative NUT charge counterpart serve as particular examples, for which the complex 2-dimensional space of parallel spinors gives rise to $L^2$ harmonic spinors and Rarita-Schwinger fields. For the scalar flat Taub-NUT type metric, we study the Dirac and Rarita-Schwinger equations by separating them into angular and radial equations, and obtain explicit solutions in certain special cases.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and numerical studies on ground states of trapped unitary Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We mathematically and numerically study the ground states of unitary Fermi gases. Starting from the three-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation that contains a quantum pressure term and an angular momentum rotation term, we first nondimensionalize the equation and then obtain its one-dimensional and two-dimensional counterparts in some limit regimes of the external potentials. Existence and uniqueness of the ground states of the unitary Fermi gases are studied with/without the angular momentum rotation term. We present a regularized normalized gradient flow method to compute the ground states of trapped unitary Fermi gases. Our numerical results show that the quantum pressure term has a significant effect on the ground state properties. Specifically, with the presence of the quantum pressure term, the vortex lattices are very different from those obtained in conventional Bose-Einstein condensation.</description>

      <title>Effective Operators in the Theory of Composites: Hilbert Space Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, the Hilbert space framework in the mathematical theory of composite materials is introduced for studying the properties of effective operators. The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertny\u{\i} realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true. Finally, the general theory presented here is shown to recover classical results dealing with effective conductivity but can also be applied to many other important problems involving composites in physics and engineering, e.g., in elasticity and electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Renormalization in Causal Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct multiplicative renormalization for the Epstein--Glaser renormalization scheme in perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory: To this end, we fully combine the Connes--Kreimer renormalization framework with the Epstein--Glaser renormalization scheme. In particular, in addition to the already established position-space renormalization Hopf algebra, we also construct the renormalized Feynman rules and the counterterm map via an algebraic Birkhoff decomposition. This includes a discussion about the appropriate target algebra of regularized distributions and the renormalization scheme as a Rota--Baxter operator thereon. In particular, we show that the Hadamard singular part satisfies the Rota--Baxter property and thus relate factorization in Epstein--Glaser with multiplicativity in Connes--Kreimer. Next, we define $Z$-factors as the images of the counterterm map under the corresponding combinatorial Green's functions. This allows us to define the multiplicatively renormalized Lagrange density, for which we show that the corresponding Feynman rules are regular. Finally, we exemplify the developed theory by working out the specific case of $\phi^3_6$-theory.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics for non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the two-dimensional analogue of the asymptotics for Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, for general real symbols. This formula has applications to random normal matrices with complex spectra: (i) the characteristic polynomial converges to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos random measure on the limiting droplet, in the subcritical phase; (ii) the electric potential converges pointwise to a logarithmically correlated field; (iii) the measure of its level sets (i.e. thick points) is identified; (iv) the associated free energy undergoes a freezing transition.
  This establishes emergence of the Liouville quantum gravity measure from free fermions in 2d, and universality with respect to the external potential.</description>

      <title>About possible measures in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>

      <title>Fractional calculus approach to models of adsorption: Barrier-diffusion control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mathematical model of surfactant adsorption under mixed barrier-diffusion control is analyzed using techniques from fractional calculus. The kinetic models of Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Volmer and van der Waals are considered. First, treating the Ward-Tordai integral equation as a fractional order one, the partial differential model is transformed into a single fractional ordinary differential equation for the adsorption. A transformation of the obtained equation is proposed that reduces the number of parameters to two dimensionless groups (at Frumkin and van der Waals models a third parameter appears). In the simplest case of Henry adsorption isotherm the fractional differential model depends on a single dimensionless group and an exact solution exists, represented in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. Based on this solution, second order asymptotes (at small values of the adsorption) are derived for the other models. The asymptotes of the adsorption result in a higher order asymptotes for the surface pressure (surface tension). For small surface coverage, all considered models converge to the Henry model's predictions, making it a universal first-order approximation for the surface tension. Next, the fractional differential model is written as an integral equation %of fractional order that can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ward-Tordai equation to the case of barrier-diffusion control. For computer simulation of the obtained integral equation a predictor-corrector numerical method is developed and numerical results are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of $L^2$ supercritical NLS equations in exterior domains with inhomogeneous nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence of normalized mountain pass solutions to the $L^2$-supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with inhomogeneous nonlinearity $|x|^{-\alpha}|u|^{p-2}u$ in exterior domains. In contrast, for the autonomous case ($\alpha=0$), Appolloni \&amp; Molle (2025) and Zhang \&amp; Zhang (2022) showed that potential mountain pass solutions share the same energy levels as in $\mathbb{R}^N$, causing non-existence due to energy leakage to infinity. This work demonstrates that the physically motivated decaying term $|x|^{-\alpha}$ breaks the scaling symmetry inherent in the autonomous case. Such breaking energetically separates the exterior domain problem from the whole space one and thereby prevents energy leakage. Using a novel min-max argument that combines monotonicity trick, Morse index estimates, and blow-up analysis, we prove the existence of a positive mountain pass solution for sufficiently small mass, revealing a new phenomenon of non-autonomous nonlinearities in non-compact domains.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking on graphs and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a cornerstone modern physics, defining a wealth of phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, and beyond. It requires an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and even then, for continuous symmetries, it only works if the spatial dimension is not too low, following the classic results of Coleman, Hohenberg, Mermin and Wagner. While usually discussed in the context of quantum and statistical field theories, and in particular, effective field theories, there are advantages in addressing the same kind of phenomena on discrete geometric structures rather than conventional manifolds. When the space is discretized into a lattice, a lucid picture of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking springs up, with the ultraviolet issues of continuum quantum field theory out-of-sight, and the key effect, which is infrared in nature, revealed through elementary harmonic oscillator networks. From there, it is natural to generalize lattices to other graphs/networks. In this setting, the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is controlled by fractional generalizations of resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index, and most broadly by the spectral dimension. Predictably, because of richness of discrete geometric structures in comparison with continuous manifolds, a broader array of geometries emerge where spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is blocked by large fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of local integrals of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) is understood theoretically through the existence of an extensive number of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). These conserved quantities are related to the microscopic quantum degrees of freedom that are spatially localized. Here, we present a general framework for constructing exact LIOMs with the desired locality and quantum numbers supplied as input rather than arising as emergent properties. We show that one can express the task of finding LIOMs as an optimization problem. In simple cases, solving this problem amounts to matrix diagonalization, while in more complex settings, it connects to the question of finding classical ground states of spin-glass models. We illustrate our theory using paradigmatic examples of single-particle Anderson localization and MBL in interacting spin chains. These developments unify previous results and reveal intriguing connections among many-body localization, spin-glass physics and constrained optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by critical planar percolation, we investigate a ``backbone'' event of planar Brownian motion, i.e.~the existence of two disjoint subpaths on the Brownian trajectory connecting the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the starting point to a macroscopic distance. We show that the probability of~this event is $(\log|\log\varepsilon|)^{-1}$ up to a multiplicative constant.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for the moduli space of genus-0 hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weil-Petersson volume of genus-g hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundaries is known since work of Mirzakhani to be polynomial in the boundary lengths. We provide a bijective proof of this fact in the genus-0 case in the presence of a distinguished cusp. It is based on a generalization of a recent tree bijection, by the first author and Curien, to the setting with geodesic boundaries, requiring an extension of the Bowditch-Epstein-Penner spine construction. As an application of our tree bijection we establish an explicit formula for the distance-dependent three-point function, which records an exact metric statistic measuring the difference of two geodesic distances among a triple of distinguished cusps in a Weil-Petersson random surface. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance of this function to the topological recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes and metric properties of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with many boundaries or cusps.</description>

      <title>Origins of Instability in Dynamical Systems on Undirected Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness to perturbation is a key topic in the study of complex systems occurring across a wide variety of applications from epidemiology to biochemistry. Here we analyze the eigenspectrum of the Jacobian matrices associated to a general class of networked dynamical systems, which contains information on how perturbations to a stationary state develop over time. We find that stability is always determined by a spectral outlier, but with pronounced differences to the corresponding eigenvector in different regimes. We show that, depending on model details, instability may originate in nodes of anomalously low or high degree, or may occur everywhere in the network at once. Importantly, the dependence on extremal degrees results in considerable finite-size effects with different scaling depending on the ensemble degree distribution. Our results have potentially useful applications in network monitoring to predict or prevent catastrophic failures, and we validate our analytical findings through applications to epidemic dynamics and gene regulatory systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of an initial product state in a system of almost-bosonic-extended-anyons in the large-particle limit. We show that the dynamics of this system can be well approximated, in finite time, by a product state evolving under the effective Chern--Simons--Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we provide a convergence rate for the approximation in terms of the radius $R = (\log N)^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$ of the extended anyons. These results establish a rigorous connection between the microscopic dynamics of almost-bosonic-anyon gases and the emergent macroscopic behavior described by the Chern--Simons--Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: We study the non relativistic limit of the solutions of the cubic nonlinear Klein--Gordon (KG) equation with periodic boundary conditions on an interval and we construct a family of time quasi periodic solutions which, after a Gauge transformation, converge globally uniformly in time to quasi periodic solutions of the cubic NLS. The proof is based on KAM theory. We emphasize that, regardless of the spatial domain, all the previous results concern approximations valid over compact time intervals.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eshelby's inclusion and inhomogeneity problems for transient heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eshelby's inclusion problems have been generalized to arbitrary shape of polygonal, polyhedral, and ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in an infinite isotropic domain under transient heat transfer, and Eshelby's tensors have been analytically derived to evaluate disturbed thermal fields caused by inclusions with a polynomial-form eigen-field. Transformed coordinates are applied to arbitrarily shaped inclusions for domain integrals of transient fundamental solutions. This formulation is for general transient heat transfer, and it can recover classic Eshelby's tensor for the ellipsoidal subdomain with explicit expression for the spherical domain in the steady state, Michelitsch's solution in the harmonic state, and recent solution in the transient state. The formulae for a polyhedral inclusion is verified by comparison to closed-form solutions of a spherical inclusion when the sphere is divided into many polyhedrons. The discontinuity of domain integrals for Eshelby's tensor are investigated the temporal effects are elaborated. The generalized formulation for Eshelby's problems enables the simulation and modeling of particulate composites containing inhomogeneities of various shapes for steady-state, harmonic and transient heat transfer in both two- and three-dimensional space through the equivalent inclusion method.</description>

      <title>On Riemann wave superpositions obtained from the Euler system</title>

Abstract: The paper contains an analysis of the conditions for the existence of elastic versus non-elastic wave superpositions governed by the Euler system in (1+1)-dimensions. A review of recently obtained results is presented, including the introduction of the notion of quasi-rectifiability of vector fields and its application to both elastic and non- elastic wave superpositions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing vector fields associated with the waves admitted by the Euler system is isomorphic to an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra which is the semi-direct sum of an Abelian ideal and the three-dimensional real Lie algebra. The maximal Lie module corresponding to the Euler system can be transformed, by an angle preserving transformation, to this algebra which is quasi-rectifiable and describes the behavior of wave superpositions. Based on these facts, we are able to find a parametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows for the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system.</description>

      <title>Laurent sequences, extended Rota Algebras and Categorical Discretization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel integrability-preserving discretization for a broad class of differential equations with variable coefficients, encompassing both linear and nonlinear cases. The construction is achieved via a categorical approach that enables a unified treatment of continuous and discrete dynamical systems.
  Our theoretical framework is grounded on a novel generalization of G. C. Rota's finite operator calculus, which enables us to extend the theory of basic sequence of polynomials to the setting of Laurent polynomials. Accordingly, we introduce the notion of an \textit{extended Rota algebra}, defined as a Galois differential algebra in which all difference operators act as derivations on the space of Laurent power series with respect to a suitably defined functional product.
  The core of our theory relies on the existence of covariant functors between the newly proposed Rota category of Galois differential algebras and suitable categories of abstract dynamical systems.
  In this setting, under certain regularity assumptions, a differential equation and its discrete analogues are naturally interpreted as objects of the same category. This perspective enables the construction of a vast class of integrable maps that share with their continuous analogues a wide set of exact solutions, \textit{regular} or \textit{singular} and, in the linear case, the Picard-Vessiot group.</description>

      <title>A new use of nonlocal symmetries for computing Liouvillian first integrals of rational second order ordinary differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present an efficient method for finding and using a nonlocal symmetry admitted by a rational second order ordinary differential equation (rational 2ODE) in order to find a Liouvillian first integral (belonging to a vast class of Liouvillian functions). In a first stage, we construct an algorithm (improving the methodde veloped in [1]) that computes a nonlocal symmetry of a rational 2ODE. In ase cond stage, based on the knowledge of this symmetry, it is possible to construct three polynomial vector fields (in R2), which "share" the Liouvillian first integral with the rational 2ODE. These "plane" polynomial vector fields can be used to construct a procedure (based on an idea developed in [2]) to determine an integrating factor for the rational 2ODE with a fast probabilistic algorithm. The main advantages of the proposed method are: the obtaining of the nonlocal symmetry is algorithmic and very efficient and, furthermore, its use to find an integrating factor is a sequence of linear or quasilinear processes.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results. Yet, the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we shed light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model offers deep connections between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representations of the rotation group. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. Results about finite-dimensional matrices can then be transferred to infinite-dimensional fluids via quantization theory, which is here used as an analysis tool (albeit traditionally describing the limit between quantum and classical physics). We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Disordered Gibbs measures and Gaussian conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the law of a random field $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ evaluated at a random sample from the Gibbs measure associated to a Gaussian field $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$. In the high-temperature regime, we show that bounds on the probability that $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})\in A$ for $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ randomly sampled from the Gibbs measure can be deduced from similar bounds for deterministic $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ under the conditional Gaussian law given that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$ for $E$ close to the derivative $F'(\beta)$ of the free energy (which is the typical value of $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N$ under the Gibbs measure). In the more challenging low-temperature regime we restrict to $k$-RSB spherical spin glasses, proving a similar result, now with a more elaborate conditioning. Namely, with $q_i$ denoting the locations of the non-zero atoms of the Parisi measure, in addition to specifying that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$, here one needs to also condition on the energy and its gradient at points $\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_k$ such that $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j\rangle/N=q_{i\wedge j}$ and $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\sigma}\rangle/N\approx q_{i}$. Like in the high-temperature phase, the energy and gradient values on which one conditions are also specified by the model's Parisi measure. We apply our general results to two important problems from statistical physics. That is, computing the Franz-Parisi potential at any temperature and, reducing certain asymptotics of Langevin dynamics with initial conditions distributed according to the Gibbs measure, to the more manageable problem of studying dynamics with non-random initial conditions and conditional disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of eta invariant is traditionally defined by means of analytic continuation. We prove, by examining the particular case of the operator curl, that the eta invariant can equivalently be obtained as the trace of the difference of positive and negative spectral projections, appropriately regularised. Our construction is direct, in the sense that it does not involve analytic continuation, and is based on the use of pseudodifferential techniques. This provides a novel approach to the study of spectral asymmetry of non-semibounded (pseudo)differential systems on manifolds which encompasses and extends previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algebraic geometry-inspired approach for constructing entangled subspaces within the Hilbert space of a multipartite quantum system. Specifically, our method employs a modified Veronese embedding, restricted to the conic, to define subspaces within the symmetric part of the Hilbert space. By utilizing this technique, we construct the minimal-dimensional, non-orthogonal yet Unextendible Product Basis (nUPB), enabling the decomposition of the multipartite Hilbert space into a two-dimensional subspace, complemented by a Genuinely Entangled Subspace (GES) and a maximal-dimensional Completely Entangled Subspace (CES). In multiqudit systems, we determine the maximum achievable dimension of a symmetric GES and demonstrate its realization through this construction. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the transition from the conventional Veronese embedding to the modified one by imposing various constraints on the affine coordinates, which, in turn, increases the CES dimension while reducing that of the GES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a graded bracket of forms on multicontact manifolds. This bracket satisfies a graded Jacobi identity as well as two different versions of the Leibniz rule, one of them being a weak Leibniz rule, extending the well-known notions in contact geometry. In addition, we develop the multisymplectization of multicontact structures to relate these brackets to the ones present in multisymplectic geometry and obtain the field equations in an abstract context. The Jacobi bracket also permits to study the evolution of observables and study the dissipation phenomena, which we also address. Finally, we apply the results to classical dissipative field theories.</description>

Abstract: Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is one of the classic seismic imaging methods to reconstruct model perturbations within a known reference medium. It can be computed in either data or image domain using different methods by solving a linear inverse problem, whereas a careful comparison analysis of them is lacking in the literature. In this article, we present a comparative study for multiparameter LSRTM in data- and image- domain in the framework of SMIwiz open software. Different from conventional LSRTM for recovering only velocity perturbation with variable density, we focus on simultaneous reconstruction of velocity and impedance perturbations after logorithmic scaling, using the first-order velocity-pressure formulation of acoustic wave equation. The first 3D data-domain LSRTM example has been performed to validate our implementation, involving expensive repetition of Born modelling and migration over a number of iterations. As a more cost-effective alternative, the image-domain LSRTM is implemented using point spread function (PSF) and nonstationary deblurring filter. Dramatic disctinctions between data and image domain methods are discovered with 2D Marmousi test: (1) The data-domain multiparameter inversion provides much better reconstruction of reflectivity images than image-domain approaches, thanks to the complete use of Hessian in Krylov space; (2) The poor multiparameter image-domain inversion highlights the limitation of incomplete Hessian sampling and strong parameter crosstalks, making it difficult to work in practice; (3) In contrast, monoparameter image-domain inversion for seismic impedance is found to work well. These observations have been further validated on Viking Graben Line 12 dataset.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for correctness of complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a family of correctness conditions for complex Langevin simulations. In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation values of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's Schwinger-Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation values are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in the context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general probability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on a real manifold. We stress that, while the proposed conditions are necessary and sufficient in a mathematical sense, their practical use is not to prove the correctness of obtained simulation results. Rather, they are mainly useful for detecting incorrect convergence. In particular, we test these criteria in a few simple one- and two-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out incorrect results without the need of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Energy Ising Machine Leveraging Difference-of-Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as finding the ground state of the Ising model. Existing Ising solvers are mostly inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose solving the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing an attraction potential that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. A key property of this potential is that its combination with the Ising energy produces a Hamiltonian that can be written as a difference of convex polynomials. This enables us to design efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and provide convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver on a wide range of GPU platforms, from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</description>

      <title>The Semiclassical limit of $SU(3)$ Gauge Field Coherent States: Peakedness and Overlap Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the heat kernel method, we construct diffeomorphism-covariant coherent states for the $SU(3)$ gauge group. We numerically demonstrate that these states exhibit the required semiclassical properties in the semiclassical limit: the peakedness property of the probability distribution and the peakedness property of the overlap function. We also provide the leading order term of the overlap amplitude in the combined limit where $t \rightarrow 0$ and $g\rightarrow g'$. This work provides the essential tool for deriving effective dynamics for $SU(3)$ gauge fields coupled to gravity via a coherent state path integral.</description>

      <title>Gibbs polystability of Fano manifolds, stability thresholds and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the probabilistic approach for constructing Kahler-Einstein metrics on log Fano manifolds - involving random point processes - to the case of non-discrete automorphism groups, by explicitly breaking the symmetry. This yields a new algebraic notion of Gibbs polystability, conjecturally equivalent to K-polystability. The definition involves a limit of log canonical thresholds on the GIT semistable locus of the N-fold products of the Fano manifold that we conjecture coincides with an analytic reduced stability threshold encoding the coercivity of the K-energy functional modulo automorphisms. These conjectures follow from an overarching conjectural Large Deviation Principle for the limit when N tends to infinity. We prove several of our conjectures for log Fano curves. By imposing a moment constraint, we derive a strengthened form of the sharp logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the two-sphere, that implies the sharp form of Aubin's refinement of the Moser-Trudinger inequality. In companion papers we will present applications to Onsager's point vortex model on the two-sphere and the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Quantum resource degradation theory within the framework of observational entropy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of quantum resource degradation grounded in a decomposition of observational entropy, which partitions the total resource into inter-block coherence ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$) and intra-block noise ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$). Under free operations, the total quantum resource is transformed into classical noise while its overall quantity remains conserved. We demonstrate that the metric $\eta$ functions as a diagnostic indicator, providing a new lens on optimization stagnation, particularly the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP) in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). We substantiate this framework through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, and we explore how these channels can be physically implemented in real quantum systems. Our approach offers a unified viewpoint on quantum thermalization, measurement-induced disturbance, and the degradation of quantum advantage in practical devices, while also improving optimization strategies for current and near-term noisy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study for Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the gravity 4D Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $\zeta$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant in $D&lt;5$ spacetimes.</description>
