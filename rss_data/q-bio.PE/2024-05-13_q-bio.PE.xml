      <title>Optimal epidemic control by social distancing and vaccination of an infection structured by time since infection: the covid-19 case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the issue of COVID-19 mitigation, in this work we tackle the general problem of optimally controlling an epidemic outbreak of a communicable disease structured by time since exposure, by the aid of two types of control instruments namely, social distancing and vaccination by a vaccine at least partly effective in protecting from infection. Effective vaccines are assumed to be made available only in a subsequent period of the epidemic so that - in the first period - epidemic control only relies on social distancing, as it happened for the COVID-19 pandemic. By our analyses, we could prove the existence of (at least) one optimal control pair, we derived first-order necessary conditions for optimality, and proved some useful properties of such optimal solutions. A worked example provides a number of further insights on the relationships between key control and epidemic parameters.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Language and Human Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If language evolved by sexual selection to display superior intelligence, then we require conversational skills, to impress other people, gain high social status, and get a mate. Conversational skills include a Theory of Mind, a sense of self, self esteem and social emotions. To be impressive, we must converse fluently and fast. The syntax of an utterance is defined by fast unification of feature structures. The pragmatic skills of conversation are also learned and deployed as feature structures; we rehearse conversations as verbal thoughts. Many aspects of our mental lives (such as our Theory of Mind, and our social emotions) work by fast, pre conscious unification of learned feature structures, rather than rational deliberation. As we think, we use the Fast Theory of Mind to infer (unreliably) how a Shadow Audience will regard what we think, say, and do. These forces, which determine our motivations and actions, are less rational and deliberate than we like to suppose</description>

      <title>Phylo2Vec: a vector representation for binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary phylogenetic trees inferred from biological data are central to understanding the shared history among evolutionary units. However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is NP-hard and thus computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search. These methods use different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.</description>
