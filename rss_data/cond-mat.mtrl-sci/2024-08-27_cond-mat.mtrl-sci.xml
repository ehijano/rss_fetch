      <title>Damage-tolerant oxides by imprint of an ultra-high dislocation density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in ductile ceramics offer the potential for robust mechanical performance while unlocking versatile functional properties. Previous studies have been limited by small volumes with dislocations and/or low dislocation densities in ceramics. Here, we use Brinell ball scratching to create crack-free, large plastic zones, offering a simple and effective method for dislocation engineering at room temperature. Using MgO, we tailor high dislocation densities up to ~10^15 m^-2. We characterize the plastic zones by chemical etching, electron channeling contrast imaging, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, and further demonstrate that crack initiation and propagation in the plastic zones with high-density dislocations can be completely suppressed. The residual stresses in the plastic zones were analyzed using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction. With the residual stress being subsequently relieved via thermal annealing while retaining the high-density dislocations, we observe the cracks are no longer completely suppressed, but the pure toughening effect of the dislocations remains evident.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld-Bethe analysis of ZT in inhomogeneous thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of good thermoelectric materials exhibiting high $ZT$ (=$\frac{PF}{\kappa} T$) requires maximizing power factor, $PF$, mainly governed by electrons, and minimizing thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, associated not only with electrons but also with phonons.
  In the present work, we focus on the GeTe and Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ as high $ZT$ materials with inhomogeneous structures and analyze both electrical conductivity, $L_{11}$, and Seebeck coefficient, $S$, with help of Sommerfeld-Bethe formula, resulting in understanding the temperature dependence of $PF$ and the identification of electrons contribution to thermal conductivity, $\kappa_{\rm el}$. Comparing the obtained $\kappa_{\rm el}$ and experimentally measured $\kappa$, the temperature dependence of phonons contribution to thermal conductivity, $\kappa_{\rm ph}=\kappa-\kappa_{\rm el}$, is inferred and analyzed based on the formula by Holland. Comparison of the GeTe and Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ with different types of crystal structures, i.e., GeTe being of a semiordered zigzag nanostructure like a disrupted herringbone structure while Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ of rather uniform amorphous structure, discloses that size effects on temperature dependence of $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ is large in the former, while very small in the latter.
  Hence, it is concluded that not only the size of the grain but also its shape has an important influence on $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ and then $ZT$.</description>

      <title>Accelerating material melting temperature predictions by implementing machine learning potentials in the SLUSCHI package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SLUSCHI (Solid and Liquid in Ultra Small Coexistence with Hovering Interfaces) automated package, with interface to the first-principles code VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package), was developed by us for efficiently determining the melting temperatures of various materials. However, performing many molecular dynamics simulations for small liquid-solid coexisting supercells to predict the melting temperature of a material is still computationally expensive, often requiring weeks and tens to hundreds of thousands of CPU hours to complete. In the present paper, we made an attempt to interface the SLUSCHI package with the highly efficient molecular dynamics LAMMPS code and demonstrated that it achieves a much faster melting temperature determination, outperforming the original VASP-based approach by at least one order of magnitude. In our melting temperature calculations, the LAMMPS simulations were performed based on the LASP (Large-scale Atomic Simulation) machine learning potentials which are pre-built using first-principles data. Besides the dramatic CPU time reduction for melting temperature predictions the calculated melting temperatures for various materials (simple and transition metals, alloys, oxides and carbide) are reasonably accurate. Analysis of the calculated results shows that 60% of the melting temperatures are within 200 K of experimental values with the RMSE value of 187 K which is slightly worse than the first-principles DFT RMSE value of 151 K. Therefore, interfacing SLUSCHI with LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations makes it possible to quickly screen out the best candidates from numerous materials in a much more efficient way, and facilitate the rational design of materials within the framework of the materials genome paradigm.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Driven Transient Hydrogenation in Metal Superhydrides at Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, metal hydride research has become one of the driving forces of the high-pressure community, as it is believed to hold the key to superconductivity close to ambient temperature. While numerous novel metal hydride compounds have been reported and extensively investigated for their superconducting properties, little attention has been focused on the atomic and electronic states of hydrogen, the main ingredient in these novel compounds. Here, we present combined $^{1}H$- and $^{139}La$-NMR data on lanthanum superhydrides, $LaH_{x}$, ($x = 10.2 - 11.1$), synthesized after laser heating at pressures above 160 GPa. Strikingly, we found hydrogen to be in a highly diffusive state at room temperature, with diffusion coefficients in the order of $10^{-6}~cm^2s^{-1}$. We found that this diffusive state of hydrogen results in a dynamic de-hydrogenation of the sample over the course of several weeks, approaching a composition similar to its precursor materials. Quantitative measurements demonstrate that the synthesized superhydrides continuously decompose over time. Transport measurements underline this conclusion as superconducting critical temperatures were found to decrease significantly over time as well. This observation sheds new light on formerly unanswered questions on the long-term stability of metal superhydrides.</description>

      <title>Structures and infrared spectroscopy of Au$_{10}$ cluster at different temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of Au$_{10}$ clusters entails identifying the lowest energy structure at cold and warm temperatures. While functional materials operate at finite temperatures, energy computations using density functional theory are typically performed at zero temperature, resulting in unexplored properties. Our study undertook an exploration of the potential and free energy surface of the neutral Au$_{10}$ nanocluster at finite temperatures by employing a genetic algorithm combined with density functional theory and nanothermodynamics. We computed the thermal population and infrared Boltzmann spectrum at a finite temperature, aligning the results with validated experimental data. The Zero-Order Regular Approximation (ZORA) gave consideration to relativistic effects, and dispersion was incorporated using Grimme's dispersion D3BJ with Becke-Johnson damping. Moreover, nanothermodynamics was utilized to account for temperature contributions. The computed thermal population strongly supports the dominance of the 2D elongated hexagon configuration within a temperature range of 50 to 800 K. Importantly, at a temperature of 100 K, the calculated IR Boltzmann spectrum aligns with the experimental IR spectrum. Lastly, the chemical bonding analysis on the lowest energy structure indicates a closed-shell Au-Au interaction with a weak or partially covalent character.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emission from Coupled Spin Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable defect qubits in wide band gap materials are favorable candidates for room temperature quantum information processing. The two dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an attractive solid state platform with a great potential for hosting bright quantum emitters with quantum memories with leveraging the potential of 2D materials for realizing scalable preparation of defect qubits. Although, room temperature bright defect qubits have been recently reported in hBN but their microscopic origin, the nature of the optical transition as well as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) have been remained elusive. Here we connect the photostability and spectral diffusion of quantum emitters to donor-acceptor pairs (DAP) in hBN by means of ab initio calculations. We find that DAPs can exhibit ODMR signal for the acceptor counterpart of the defect pair with S = 1/2 ground state at non-zero magnetic fields depending on the donor partner. The donor-acceptor pair model and its transition mechanisms provide a recipe towards defect qubit identification and performance optimization in hBN for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Cahn-Hilliard model with Schl\"ogl Reactions: interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. II. Memory effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is the continuation of our paper [1]. It is devoted to the modeling of the interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. The modeling of equilibrium phase transition is based on the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. The non-equilibrium phase transition is modeled by the Second Schl\"ogl reaction system. We consider the advancing front, which combines these both transitions. Different from [1], we consider here the memory effects, i.e. the effects of non-Fickian diffusion. The traveling wave solution is obtained, its dependence on the model parameters is studied in detail. The relative importance of memory effects for different process regimes is estimated.</description>

      <title>Impact of Annealing on Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy in W/MgAl2O4/CoFeMnSi/W/CoFeMnSi/MgAl2O4/W. Double Storage Layers for Upcoming MTJs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we achieved the improvement of uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in the W/MgAl2O4/CoFeMnSi/W/CoFeMnSi/MgAl2O4/W heterostructure by manipulating the annealing temperature (TA) [350 C, 450 C, and 550 C]. We observed a maximum effective PMA energy density (Keff) of = 1.604 x 106 erg/cc with low saturation magnetization (Ms) at the specified TA. The enhancement of Keff with Ms is significantly influenced by structural variations at the interfaces of CoFeMnSi and MgAl2O4, attributed to sufficient interfacial oxidation dependent on the TA. The TA was identified as a critical factor affecting the surface morphology, grain size, and surface roughness of the multilayer. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements were employed to confirm the presence of Co-O or Fe-O bond in the multilayer structures, elucidating the true origin of PMA. The control of interfacial oxidation at the interface during annealing is crucial for regulating the strength of PMA. Therefore, this double CoFeMnSi/MgAl2O4-based multilayer presents a promising avenue, serving as a favorable candidate for future p-MTJs-based spintronic devices with enhanced thermal stability.</description>

      <title>Continuous alloying between rocksalt and half-Heusler structures drives metal-semiconductor transition in ErNi$_x$Sb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XYZ half-Heusler phases are often described as a XZ rock salt sublattice with an interstitial Y atom. However, transport across a solid solution between rock salt and half-Heusler structures has not previously been studied. In this paper, we demonstrate the exceptional tolerance of Ni vacancies in ErNi$_x$Sb, resulting in a complete alloy in the ErSb-ErNiSb space. Thermoelectric characterization demonstrates a continuous electronic transition associated with the gradual collapse of the band gap with Ni removal. The carrier concentration increase by three orders of magnitude and Seebeck coefficient decreases from 260 uV/K to &lt;5 uV/K. Speed of sound measurements indicate that removal of Ni softens the lattice, consistent with the breakdown of the covalent Ni-Sb sublattice. For low Ni content compositions, the combination of low speed of sound coupled with Ni vacancies strongly hamper the propagation of phonons. The ability to control the electronic and thermal transport properties across the rock salt to half-Heusler continuum opens new material design strategies across thermoelectricity, superconductivity, and non-trivial topology</description>

      <title>Electron transport in quasi-ballistic FETs subjected to a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the study of quasi-ballistic electron transport in short FETs subjected to magnetic field. Spatial distributions of electron concentrations, velocities, Hall currents and voltages in the short FET channels are determined. The basic properties of current-voltage characteristics of quasi-ballistic FETs in magnetic field are analyzed, among these the kink-like characteristics of the near-ballistic device. Peculiarities of magnetoresistance of such FETs are studied for low and high magnetic fields, and different current regimes. For nonlinear current regimes we revealed significantly larger magnetoresistance for the devices with higher ballisticity. Numerical estimates of studied effects are presented. We suggest, that the found results contribute to the physics of short FETs and can be used for developing nanoscale devices for particular applications.</description>

      <title>Consistent machine learning for topology optimization with microstructure-dependent neural network material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing methods together with topology optimization have enabled the creation of multiscale structures with controlled spatially-varying material microstructure. However, topology optimization or inverse design of such structures in the presence of nonlinearities remains a challenge due to the expense of computational homogenization methods and the complexity of differentiably parameterizing the microstructural response. A solution to this challenge lies in machine learning techniques that offer efficient, differentiable mappings between the material response and its microstructural descriptors. This work presents a framework for designing multiscale heterogeneous structures with spatially varying microstructures by merging a homogenization-based topology optimization strategy with a consistent machine learning approach grounded in hyperelasticity theory. We leverage neural architectures that adhere to critical physical principles such as polyconvexity, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency to supply the framework with a reliable constitutive model that is dependent on material microstructural descriptors. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating consistent machine learning models with density-based topology optimization for enhancing design optimization of heterogeneous hyperelastic structures under finite deformations.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarised electroluminescence from chiral excitons in vacuum-sublimed supramolecular semiconductor thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with chiral electronic structures are of great interest. We report a triazatruxene, TAT, molecular semiconductor with chiral alkyl side chains that crystallises from solution to form chirally-stacked columns with a helical pitch of 6 TATs (2.3 nm). These crystals show strong circularly polarised, CP, green photoluminescence, with dissymmetry of 24%. Electronic structure calculations using the full crystal structure, show that this chiral stacking associates angular momentum to the valence and conduction states and thus gives rise to the observed CP luminescence. Free-standing crystals are not useful for active semiconductor devices, but we have discovered that co-sublimation of TAT as the guest in a structurally mismatched host enables the fabrication of thin films where the chiral crystallization is achieved in-situ by thermally-triggered nano-phase segregation of dopant and host whilst preserving the integrity of the film. This enables fabrication of bright (green) organic light-emitting diodes with unexpectedly high external quantum efficiencies of up to 16% and electroluminescence dissymmetries above 10%. These materials and this process method offer significant application potential in spintronics, optical displays and multidimensional optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin Carbon Biphenylene Network as an Anisotropic Thermoelectric Material with High Temperature Stability Under Mechanical Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon biphenylene network (C-BPN), which is an ultra-thin material consisting of carbon atoms arranged in square-hexagonal-octagonal (4-6-8) periodic rings, has intriguing properties for nano-scale device design due to its unique crystal structure. Here, using the Landauer formalism in combination with first-principles calculations, we show that C-BPN is a highly stable thermoelectric material at elevated temperatures under mechanical strain, where its thermoelectric efficiency can be anisotropically engineered. Transport calculations reveal that C-BPN's transmission spectrum has significant degrees of directional anisotropy and it undergoes a metal-insulator transition under strain, which leads to an increase in its Seebeck coefficient. C-BPN's lattice thermal conductance can be selectively tuned up to 35% bidirectionally at room temperature by strain engineering. Enhancement in its power factor and the suppression of its lattice thermal conductance improves the p-type figure of merit up to 0.31 and 0.76 at 300 and 1000~K, respectively. Our findings reveal that C-BPN has high potency to be used in thermoelectric nano devices with selective anisotropic properties at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite nitrides are starting to be explored for their promising properties distinct from their oxide counterparts. Here, through first-principles density functional computations, we study the intricate relationship between ferroelectricity and metallicity in the ferroelectric nitride LaWN$_3$. We systematically assess the impact of electron and hole doping via the background charge method, revealing that both types of charge carriers diminish the propensity for ferroelectricity in LaWN$_3$, although to remarkably different extents. Specifically, the introduction of electrons leads to centrosymmetry at a lower concentration value of nearly 0.2 electrons per formula unit. In contrast, the addition of holes does not result in centrosymmetry at reasonable doping values of up to 0.3 holes per formula unit. We present the underlying mechanisms behind these findings, noting that adding electrons fills the valence orbitals of both W and N atoms. This filling leads to a screening effect on the long-range repulsion between these atoms, thereby reducing the off-centering of W. On the other hand, hole doping does not significantly alter the W-N bonding nature, resulting in a more robust off-centering. Furthermore, we introduce explicit impurity atoms and analyze the influence of the different factors contributing to the change in polarization, namely, the size of the dopant, charge carriers introduced by the dopant, and changes in lattice constants. We discover that doped LaWN$_3$ can be a promising polar metal, especially with acceptor dopants. Our study comprehensively shows the interplay between polarity and metallicity in this prototypical perovskite nitride.</description>

      <title>Indexing neutron transmission spectra of rotating crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron time-of-flight transmission spectra of mosaic crystals contain Bragg dips, i.e., minima at wavelengths corresponding to diffraction reflections. Positions of the dips are used for investigating crystal lattices. By rotating the sample around a fixed axis and recording spectrum at each rotation step, the intensity of the transmitted beam is obtained as a function of the rotation angle and wavelength. The questions addressed concern determination of lattices parameters and orientations of centrosymmetric crystals from such data. It is shown that if the axis of sample rotation is inclined to the beam direction, the reflection positions unambiguously determine reciprocal lattice vectors, which is not the case when the axis is perpendicular to the beam. Having a set of such vectors, one can compute crystal orientation or lattice parameters using existing indexing software. The considerations are applicable to arbitrary Laue symmetry. The work contributes to the automation of analysis of diffraction data obtained in the neutron imaging mode.</description>

      <title>Variable offsets and processing of implicit forms toward the adaptive synthesis and analysis of heterogeneous conforming microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of porous, lattice, or microstructure geometries has captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. Implicit forms, such as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) has captured a significant attention, recently, as tiles in lattices, partially because implicit forms have the potential for synthesizing with ease more complex topologies of tiles, compared to parametric forms. In this work, we show how variable offsets of implicit forms could be used in lattice design as well as lattice analysis, while graded wall and edge thicknesses could be fully controlled in the lattice and even vary within a single tile. As a result, (geometrically) heterogeneous lattices could be created and adapted to follow analysis results while maintaining continuity between adjacent tiles. We demonstrate this ability on several 3D models, including TPMS.</description>

      <title>On the magnitude of error in determination of rotation axes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation axes (together with rotation angles) are often used to describe crystal orientations and misorientations, and they are also needed to characterize some properties of crystalline materials. Since experimental orientation data are subject to errors, directions of axes obtained from such data are also inaccurate. A natural question arises: given a resolution of input rotations, what is the average error of the rotation axes? Assuming that rotation data characterized by rotation angle $\omega$ deviate from actual data by error rotations with fixed angle $\delta$ but otherwise random, the average error of rotation axes of the data is expressed analytically as a function of $\omega$ and $\delta$. Moreover, a scheme for using this formula in practical cases when rotation errors $\delta$ follow the von Mises-Fisher distribution is described. Finally, the impact of crystal symmetry on determination of average errors of axis directions is discussed. The presented results are important for assessing the reliability of rotation axes in studies where directions of crystal rotations play a role, e.g. in identifying deformation slip mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance of Telecom Single Photon Emitters in GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state defects susceptible of spin manipulation hold great promise for scalable quantum technology. To broaden their utility, operating at room temperature and emitting in the telecom wavelength range are desired, eliminating cryogenic requirements and leveraging existing optical fiber infrastructure for transmitting the quantum information. To that end, we report that telecom single photon emitters (SPEs) in gallium nitride (GaN) exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) at room temperature. The analysis of ODMR as a function of magnetic field orientation enables the determination of the orientation of the spin quantization axis with respect to the GaN crystalline lattice. The optical transitions dynamics are analyzed to gain further insight into the transition rates dominating ODMR. Our findings, coupled with GaN's mature fabrication technology, could facilitate the realization of scalable quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale observation of geometric frustration in a fluorine-intercalated infinite layer nickelate superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anion doping offers immense potential for tailoring material properties, but achieving precise control over anion incorporation remains a challenge due to complex synthesis processes and limitations in local dopant detection. Here, we investigate the F-ion intercalation within an infinite layer NdNiO2+x/SrTiO3 superlattice film using a two-step synthesis approach. We employ advanced four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy to map the F distribution and its impact on the atomic and electronic structure. Our observations reveal a striking geometric reconstruction of the infinite layer structure upon fluorination, resulting in a more distorted orthorhombic phase compared to the pristine perovskite. Notably, F-ion intercalation occurs primarily at the apical sites of the polyhedron, with some occupation of basal sites in localized regions. This process leads to the formation of two distinct domains within the nickelate layer, reflecting a competition between polyhedral distortion and geometric frustration-induced neodymium (Nd) displacement near domain interfaces. Interestingly, we observe an anomalous structural distortion where basal site anions are displaced in the same direction as Nd atoms, potentially linked to the partial basal site F-ion occupation. This coexistence of diverse structural distortions signifies a locally disordered F-ion distribution within the infinite layer structure with distinct F-ion configurations. These findings provide crucial insights into understanding and manipulating anion doping at the atomic level, paving the way for the development of novel materials with precisely controlled functionalities.</description>

      <title>Thermal treatment effects on PMN-0.4PT/Fe multiferroic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic heterostructures have gained in recent years a renewed role in spintronic applications due to their possibility in controlling the magnetic properties via interfacial coupling by exploiting the ferroelectric response to various external stimuli. Whereas the main mechanisms ruling the converse magnetoelectric coupling are considered as established, the research on how to optimize the ferroelectric properties is an active field. In particular the complex phase diagram of [Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3]-x[PbTiO3] (PMN-xPT) single crystals, that present relaxor ferroelectric and photovoltaic properties, deserves further investigation. For instance, crystalline quality and thermal stability of the ferroelectric domains in heterostructures need assessment. Here we show how, by thermal annealing over the ferroelectric Curie temperature and then cooling PMN-0.4PT/Fe heterostructures in inert atmosphere the domain population is significantly modified, evolving from a highly disordered, mostly out-of-plane domain population, to improved crystallinity and prevalent in-plane oriented domains. Upon further annealing, the domain population switches back to prevalent out-of-plane orientation suggesting that intermediate annealing steps can freeze PMN-0.4PT domain population in a metastable configuration. The structural analysis was carried out by combining micro-Raman and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. In the three states the magnetic properties of interfacial Fe thin film are affected by the ferroelectric configurations as a consequence of changing interfacial strain, evolving from an isotropic behavior to an anisotropic one and back.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of domain walls in a square of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) upon excitation with an oscillating magnetic field of 4 mT amplitude were recorded by pump-probe ptychography with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Ni L$_3$-edge. The 2.5 $\mu$m Py square of 160 nm thickness forms a vortex flux-closure pattern with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane magnetization states due to the interplay of in-plane shape and growth-induced perpendicular anisotropies. Dynamic modes of the domain wall structure were excitable along with the vortex core gyration with frequencies of 500 MHz and 1 GHz. Micromagnetic simulations served to corroborate the imaged domain wall motion.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced toroidal order in molecular Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ crystalline compound with a rich temperature--pressure phase diagram that contains the ferroelectric phase, semiconductor-to-metal transition, and superconductive state, \mbox{\textit{ab initio}} molecular dynamics calculations were performed on a single unit cell and on a superstructure using an evolutionary algorithm in combination with density functional theory calculations to study structural transformations resulting from rearrangements in chemical bonds under pressure. The structure models of the pressure-induced lowest energy phases in the molecular Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ crystal demonstrate the possibility of space-arranged chains or rings of P$_2$S$_6$ molecules. Pressure can break P-P bonds of P$_2$S$_6$ molecules, causing one of the phosphorous atoms to displace into the sulfur-formed octahedron and providing another phosphorous atom into an octahedral coordination with two tin atoms and four sulfur atoms. The results of the modeling correlate with the gradual rise of deviation of the pressure dependence of the unit cell volume of the Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ structure, as determined by X-ray diffraction experiments, from the dependence calculated with the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. It also reveals toroidally ordered local dipoles in the centrosymmetric phase, which may be related to the previously observed superconductivity in the high-pressure metallic phase of Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$.</description>

      <title>Achieving Accurate Ground-States for Metals from Converged Coupled Cluster Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-electron correlation methods offer a systematic approach to predicting material properties with high precision. However, practically attaining accurate ground-state properties for bulk metals presents significant challenges. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to reach the thermodynamic limit of the total ground-state energy of metals using coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that the coupling between long-range and short-range contributions to the correlation energy is sufficiently weak, enabling us to restrict long-range contributions to low-energy excitations in a controllable way. Leveraging this insight, we calculate the surface energy of aluminum and platinum (111), providing numerical evidence that coupled cluster theory is well-suited for modeling metallic materials, particularly in surface science. Notably, our results exhibit convergence with respect to finite-size effects, basis-set size, and coupled cluster expansion, yielding excellent agreement with experimental data. This paves the way for more efficient coupled cluster calculations for large systems and a broader utilization of the theory in realistic metallic models of materials.</description>

      <title>Kagome bands and magnetism in MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome lattices facilitate various quantum phases, yet in bulk materials, their kagome flat-bands often interact with bulk bands, suppressing kagome electronic characteristics for hosting these phases. Here, we use density-functional-theory calculations to predict the geometric and electronic structures, as well as the topological and magnetic properties, of a series of MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers formed by mirror-twin-boundary (MTB) loops. We analyze nine MTB-loop configurations of varying sizes and arrangements to assess their impact on various properties. Within the intrinsic bandgap of MoTe$_{2}$, we identify two sets of kagome bands, originating from in-plane and out-of-plane Te p-orbitals at MTB-loop edges and -vertices, respectively. Three configurations exhibit superior stability, while three others show comparable stability. Among these, four display bandgaps and potentially non-zero Z$_{2}$ topological invariants, suggesting possible topological phases, while the remaining two are metallic and feature Stoner magnetization. These findings guide the design of kagome-based two-dimensional materials with tunable electronic, topological, and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>From irregular to regular eutectic growth in the Al-Al3Ni system: in situ observations during directional solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the irregular eutectic growth dynamics of the Al-Al3Ni alloy, in which one of the solid phases (Al3Ni) grows faceted from the liquid. Leveraging in situ optical microscopy and synchrotron transmission x-ray microscopy, we address the question of the degree of coupling between Al and Al3Ni at the growth front and that of the shape of the microstructures left behind in the bulk solid during directional solidification. Real-time optical observations bring evidence for a morphological transition from a eutectic-grain dependent, irregular eutectic growth at low solidification velocity V (typically 1 ${\mu}ms^{-1}$), to a weakly anisotropic, regular growth at higher V (reaching 10 ${\mu}ms^{-1}$). Unprecedented x-ray nano-imaging of the solid-liquid interface, and 3D characterization of the growth patterns, were made possible by a new Directional Solidification (DS) setup at Brookhaven National Laboratory's NSLS-II. At low V, the leading tips of partly faceted Al3Ni crystals are observed to grow not far ahead of the Al growth front. Correlating in situ images and postmortem 3D tomographic reconstructions reveals that the presence of faceted and non-faceted regions of Al3Ni crystals in the solid is a direct consequence of coupling and decoupling during DS, respectively. Upon increasing V , the lead distance of Al3Ni vanishes, and the shape of Al3Ni ceases to be governed by faceted growth. These observations shed light on the basic mechanisms (faceted growth, diffusive coupling, and the dynamics of trijunctions) governing the transition from faceted to rod-like growth upon increasing V in the Al3Ni system, with broad implications for a large class of irregular eutectics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast magnetization dynamics of an epitaxial Fe/CoO bilayer on Ag(001) is examined in an element-resolved way by resonant soft-x-ray reflectivity. The transient magnetic linear dichroism at the Co L2 edge and the magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe L3 edge measured in reflection in a pump-probe experiment with 120 fs temporal resolution show the loss of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order in CoO and Fe, respectively, both within 300 fs after excitation with 60 fs light pulses of 800 and 400 nm wavelengths. Comparison to spin-dynamics simulations using an atomistic spin model shows that direct energy transfer from the laser-excited electrons in Fe to the magnetic moments in CoO provides the dominant demagnetization channel in the case of 800-nm excitation.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Design of Au-Based Alloys for Improved Plasmon Delivery and Nanoheating in Near-Field Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic near-field transducers (NFTs) play a key role in administering nanoscale heating for a number of applications ranging from medical devices to next generation data processing technology. We present a novel multi-scale approach, combining quantum many-body perturbation theory with finite-element modelling, to predict the electric and thermal material parameters of various Au-based, noble metal (M) alloys. Specifically, we focus on modelling their performance within an NFT designed to focus high-intensity, sub-diffracted light for technologies such as nanoscale etching, manipulation, sensing, and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). Elemental Au is the long-standing general-purpose NFT medium due its excellent plasmonic performance at relevant wavelengths. However, elemental Au is a soft, ductile material that tends to extrude and deform in response to extreme temperature gradients. Therefore, alloying Au with other noble metals such as Ag, Cu, Pd or Pt, has attracted considerable interest for improved mechanical and thermal robustness while reaching threshold plasmonic generation at standard optoelectronics operating wavelengths (e.g., $\approx 830$~nm) and approximate high-power NFT temperatures ($\approx 400$~K). We predict that certain Au-Ag alloys may offer improved thermal stability as whole-NFT media compared to elemental Au, alongside plasmonic figures of merit comparable to that of Au. Simulations of certain solid solution Au-Pd/Pt alloys enable us to predict significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. We predict that alloying with Pd at low concentrations $\sim 10\%$ may preserve the NFT performance of Au, while offering the benefits of improved thermal and mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilized form chirality in curved rod nematics: structure and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite almost a century of anticipation, polar uniaxial nematics were only recently discovered and shown to adopt a chiral supramolecular structure. Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods-form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation violates splay- and twist-bend continuum elasticity. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.</description>

      <title>Coexisting phases of individual VO$_2$ nanoparticles for multilevel nanoscale memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) has received significant interest in the context of nanophotonic metamaterials and memories owing to its reversible insulator-metal transition associated with significant changes in its optical and electronic properties. While the VO$_2$ transition has been extensively studied for several decades, the hysteresis dynamics of individual single-crystal VO$_2$ nanoparticles (NPs) remains largely unexplored. Here, employing transmission electron microscopy techniques, we investigate phase transitions of single VO$_2$ NPs in real time. Our analysis reveals the statistical distribution of the transition temperature and steepness and how they differ during forward (heating) and backward (cooling) transitions. We assess the stability of coexisting phases in individual NPs and prove the persistent multilevel memory at near-room temperatures using only a few VO$_2$ NPs. Our findings shed new light on the underlying physical mechanisms governing the hysteresis of VO$_2$ and establish VO$_2$ NPs as a promising component of optoelectronic and memory devices with enhanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Phonon-assisted Casimir interactions between piezoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between electromagnetic field and lattice oscillation in piezoelectric materials gives rise to phonon polariton excitations. Such quasiparticles open up new directions in modulating the ubiquitous Casimir force. Here by utilizing the generalized Born-Huang hydrodynamics model, three types of phonons in piezoelectrics are studied: longitudinal optical phonon, transverse optical phonon and phonon polariton. The phonon-electromagnetic coupling results in a complex set of Fresnel reflection matrices which prevents the utilization of the standard Lifshitz approach for calculating Casimir forces in the imaginary frequency domain. Our calculations are based on an approach within real frequency and finite temperatures, through which various regimes of the Casimir interaction are examined. Our study shows that piezoelectrics emerge as a set of materials where this ubiquitous force can be controlled via phonon properties for the first time. The Casimir interaction appears as a suitable means to distinguish between different types of surface phonon polaritons associated with different structural piezoelectric polytypes.</description>

      <title>I-centered vs F-centered orthorhombic symmetry and negative thermal expansion of the charge density wave of EuAl2Ga2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Together with EuGa4 and EuAl4, EuAl2Ga2 belongs to the BaAl4 structure type with space group symmetry I4/mmm. EuAl2Ga2 develops an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) at temperatures below TCDW = 51 K. On the basis of temperature dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) data, the incommensurately modulated CDW crystal structure of EuAl2Ga2 is determined to possess orthorhombic superspace symmetry Immm(00g)s00. This symmetry is different from the orthorhombic Fmmm based symmetry of the CDW state of EuAl4. Nevertheless, both symmetries Immm(00g)s00 and Fmmm(00g)s00 lead to the same conclusion, that the CDW is supported by the layers of Al1 type atoms, while the Eu and Al2 or Ga atoms are not directly involved in CDW formation. The different symmetries of the CDW states of EuAl4 and EuAl2Ga2, as well as the observation of negative thermal expansion in the CDW state of EuAl2Ga2 might be explained by the effects of Ga substitution in the latter compound.</description>

      <title>Theory of perturbation of the magnetostatic field by an anisotropic magnetic toroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perturbation of a magnetostatic field by a toroid made of a homogeneous anisotropic magnetic material was formulated using the solutions of the Laplace equation in the toroidal coordinate system. That was straightforward in the region outside the toroid, but an affine coordinate transformation had to be employed inside the toroid. The coefficients of the series expansion of the perturbation potential in terms of appropriate toroidal basis functions were related to the coefficients of the series expansion of the source potential in terms of appropriate toroidal basis functions by a transition matrix. As a result of the solution of this novel problem, the consequences of material anisotropy on perturbing the magnetostatic field are clearly evident in the region near the toroid.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Charge Transfer Dynamics at the MoS$_2$/Au Interface Observed via Optical Spectroscopy under Ambient Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To take advantage of the exceptional properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) for advanced devices and catalysts, integration with metallic surfaces is an efficacious approach for facilitating charge carrier injection and extraction from TMDC monolayers. Light-matter interactions predominantly occur at the K point in TMDC monolayers, making the charge carrier dynamics at this point essential for their optimal performance. However, direct access to and comprehensive understanding of the charge carrier dynamics at the K point of TMDC monolayer on a metal substrate remains challenging. In this study, we employed azimuth- and polarization-dependent final-state sum frequency generation (FS-SFG) spectroscopy to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of charge transfer at the K point of a MoS$_2$ monolayer interfaced with an Au substrate. We observed an ultrafast injection (sub-20 fs) of photoexcited hot electrons from the Au substrate to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the MoS$_2$ monolayer. Subsequently, driven by an internal electric field induced by charge redistribution, injected hot electrons in MoS$_2$ experience a relaxation and fast return ($\sim2$ ps) from the CBM and a trap state mediated slow return ($\sim60$ ps) process. The direct optical observation of the full electron dynamics at the K point of MoS$_2$ monolayer in ambient conditions provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of charge carrier transfer across the TMDC-metal interface, informing the design of advanced TMDC-based devices with enhanced charge transfer rates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Generalized-Order Constitutive Modeling of Viscoelastic Spectra of Polyurea-Graphene Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyurea (PUa) elastomers are extensively used in a wide range of applications spanning from biomedical to defense fields due to their enabling mechanical properties. These materials can be further reinforced through the incorporation of nanoparticles to form nanocomposites. This study focuses on an IPDI-based PUa matrix with exfoliated graphene nanoplatelet (xGnP) fillers. We propose a generalized constitutive model by integrating one Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) and one Fractional Maxwell Gel (FMG) branch in a parallel configuration via introducing a new dimensionless number to bridge between these branches physically and mathematically. Through systematic local-to-global sensitivity analyses, we investigate the behavior of these nanocomposites to facilitate simulation, design, and performance prediction. Consistently, the constructed models share the same most/least influential model parameters. $\alpha_1$ and $E_{c_1}$, the power exponent and the characteristic modulus of the first branch, are found to be the most influential model parameters, while $\tau_{c_2}$ and $\tau_{c_1}$, the characteristic time-scales of each branch, are recognized as the least influential model parameters. The proposed PU nanocomposite constitutive laws can now make an impact to the design and optimization of coating and shock-absorbing coatings in a range of applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and long-range magnetic ordering in NiO tuned by pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory method we revisit the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the prototypical correlated insulator NiO. We study the pressure-induced evolution of the electronic structure, magnetic state, and exchange couplings of the antiferromagnetic phase of NiO. We calculate the ordered magnetic moments and uniform spin susceptibility of the Ni $3d$ states of NiO, which allow us to determine the pressure-dependence of the N\'eel temperature $T_N$. We note that the long-range magnetism has no significant effects on the valence band photoemission spectra of NiO under moderate compressions, implying the importance of correlations effects to explain the insulating state of NiO. The antiferromagnetic insulating state is found to be stable up to the high compression value $\sim$0.4 $V_0$ (assuming the cubic $B1$ crystal structure of NiO), and is associated with a (correlated-assisted) Slater insulating state driven by the long-range magnetic ordering. In fact, the paramagnetic phase of NiO at such high compression is found to be metallic, implying delocalization of the Ni $3d$ states. The calculated $T_N$ exhibits a non-monotonic behavior upon compression, with a maximum associated with the crossover from Mott localized (strong coupling) to itinerant moment regimes, in qualitative agreement with the phase diagram of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. We point out the importance of the non-local correlation effects to explain the magnetic properties of NiO.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid phase separation at the interface of an evaporating droplet; formation of a regular lattice pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaporation alters the molecular interactions and leads to phase separation within the evaporating liquid. The question of whether evaporation could lead to specific phase separation at the liquid interface and eventually to the formation of patterns in small liquid volumes remains unaddressed. In this study, we investigated the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of an organic polymeric monomer in a salt-containing buffer within an evaporating sessile droplet. We observed that LLPS occurs at the dynamic interface of the droplet and leads to the formation of polymeric coacervates or regular lattice patterns depending on the initial concentration of the polymer. Our results show that the interaction of salt with the polymeric monomers at the droplet interface can lead to LLPS and the formation of regular patterns. This study suggests that the sessile droplet setup can be utilized to achieve very regular patterns as a result of LLPS.</description>

Abstract: Materials with switchable nanostructured surfaces enable optical and electronic functionalities beyond those of natural materials. Here we report the creation of self-organized, re-writable, laser-induced surface structures in single-crystalline vanadium dioxide. We discover anisotropic features caused by canalized surface plasmon polaritons that can only propagate along one crystal axis. The nanostructures remain single-crystalline and preserve the raw material's metal-to-insulator transition, enabling femtosecond switching by temperature or light.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal SmAlSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has been reported in numerous ferromagnetic (FM) Weyl semimetals. However, AHE in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) or paramagnetic (PM) state of Weyl semimetals has been rarely observed experimentally, and only in centrosymmetric materials. Different mechanisms have been proposed to establish the connection between the AHE and the type of magnetic order. In this paper, we report AHE in both the AFM and PM states of non-centrosymmetric compound SmAlSi. To account for the AHE in non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals without FM, we introduce a new mechanism based on magnetic field-induced Weyl nodes evolution. Angle-dependent quantum oscillations in SmAlSi provide evidence for the Weyl points and large AHE in both the PM and the AFM states. The proposed mechanism qualitatively explains the temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), which displays unconventional power law behavior of the AHC in both AFM and PM states of SmAlSi.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Magnetization by Defect-Assisted Exciton Recombination in Atomically Thin CrCl$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) semiconductors present unique opportunities to intertwine optical and magnetic functionalities and to tune these performances through defects and dopants. Here, we integrate exciton pumping into a quantum sensing protocol on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to image the optically-induced transient stray fields in few-layer, antiferromagnetic CrCl$_3$. We discover that exciton recombination enhances the in-plane magnetization of the CrCl$_3$ layers, with a predominant effect in the surface monolayers. Concomitantly, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that nonradiative exciton recombination intensifies in atomically thin CrCl$_3$ with tightly localized, nearly dipole-forbidden excitons and amplified surface-to-volume ratio. Supported by experiments under controlled surface exposure and density functional theory calculations, we interpret the magnetically enhanced state to result from a defect-assisted Auger recombination that optically activates electron transfer between water vapor related surface impurities and the spin-polarized conduction band. Our work validates defect engineering as a route to enhance intrinsic magnetism in single magnetic layers and opens a novel experimental platform for studying optically-induced, transient magnetism in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Approaching Periodic Systems in Ensemble Density Functional Theory via Finite One-Dimensional Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional ``particle in a box'' systems, which approach the uniform electron gas (UEG). Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a correction to the effective mass, with results comparable to other calculations on 1D, 2D, and 3D UEGs, which indicates promise for non-trivial results from EDFT on periodic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating force constants for crystal structures is crucial for calculating various phonon-related properties. However, this task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with a large number of atoms or when third- and higher-order force constants are required. In this study, we propose an efficient approach that involves constructing a complete orthonormal basis set for the force constants. We formulate this approach using projection matrices and their eigenvectors to meet the requirements for the force constants. This basis set enables precise inference of the force constants from displacement-force datasets. Our efficient algorithms for basis-set construction and force constant estimation are implemented in the symfc code. Furthermore, several applications demonstrated in this study indicate that the current approach facilitates the efficient and accurate determination of force constants.</description>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of successive collision cascades within the same simulation domain were performed using two different inter-atomic potentials (IAP) in tungsten, one EAM based and the other a `quantum accurate' machine learning potential, SNAP. The micro-structural changes are analyzed as a function of displacements per atom (dpa) for primary knock-on atom (PKA) energies of 20 keV and 50 keV, reaching up-to irradiation dose of 0.1 and 0.2 dpa, respectively. Five sample simulations are carried out for each case for observing stochastic differences in the evolution of damage. A detailed defect analysis is carried out to observe changes in different parameters such as the number of surface defects, defect density, defect morphology and size distribution etc., as a function of dpa. We explore the properties that are sensitive to the IAP used and those that are sensitive to the PKA energy and note their similarities with experimental results at various dpa values. The SNAP potential shows better agreement with the experiments for swelling and number of surface defects. However, it also predicts presence of high number of small sessile defects which may have definite affect on the processes of microstructural evolution and material properties.</description>

      <title>A Machine-Learning Accelerated Grand Canonical Sampling Framework for Nuclear Quantum Effects in Constant Potential Electrochemistry</title>

Abstract: Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the key step for energy conversion in electrocatalysis. Atomic-scale simulation acts as an indispensable tool to provide a microscopic understanding of PCET. However, consideration of the quantum nature of transferring protons under an exact grand canonical (GC) constant potential condition is a great challenge for theoretical electrocatalysis. Here, we develop a unified computational framework to explicitly treat nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) by a sufficient GC sampling, further assisted by a machine learning force field adapted for electrochemical conditions. Our work demonstrates a non-negligible impact of NQEs on PCET simulations for hydrogen evolution reaction at room temperature, and provides a physical picture that wave-like quantum characteristic of the transferring protons facilitates the particles to tunnel through classical barriers in PCET paths, leading to a remarkable activation energy reduction compared to classical simulations. Moreover, the physical insight of NQEs may reshape our fundamental understanding of other types of PCET reactions in broader scenarios of energy conversion processes.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Application of the Two-Electron Quantum Theory of Glass States</title>

Abstract: The glass state problem stems from the failure described in terms of one-electron theory or atoms (molecules) as independent particles. In 2005, de Gennes proposed that the way to explain the glass transition in simple terms was to construct the cluster model of molecules in contact with all existing glass models and to refine the picture of the mean-field hard-sphere molecules (HSMs) in contact with each other. In the process of refining this picture, we discovered the two-electron quantum theory derived from the second solution of de Gennes n = 0, where the clustered contact of the two HSMs along the z-axis is the sequential emergence of the 16 z-direction interface excited quantum states of their coupled electron pair, the two HSMs suddenly overlap by 0.27% to form a magic-interface two-dimensional vector. The two coupled electron orbitals synchronously escaped the two HSMs 16 times, tangent to the magic interface 16 times, and 16 parallel repulsive electron pairs with an interval of 5.9987{\deg}, which is a clustered boson interaction between the two HSMs. This is the common origin of boson peaks in the glass state and electron pairing in the high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, the collective behavior of electrons in the two-electron theory can unify the glass transition and the high-temperature superconducting transition. This paper is not only a complete theoretical statement on glass transition, but also a new interpretation of the theory of high-temperature superconductivity, which provides a new theoretical perspective in the search for room-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Collective nature of phonon energies in solids beyond harmonic oscillators</title>

Abstract: Phonon quasi-particles have been monumental in microscopically understanding thermodynamics and transport properties in condensed matter for decades. Phonons have one-to-one correspondence with harmonic eigenstates and their energies are often described by simple independent harmonic oscillator models. Higher order terms in the potential energy lead to interactions among them, resulting in finite lifetimes and frequency shifts, even in perfect crystals. However, increasing evidence including constant volume heat capacity different from the expected Dulong-Petit law suggests the need for re-evaluation of phonons having harmonic energies. In this work, we explicitly examine inter-mode dependence of phonon energies of a prototypical crystal, silicon, through energy covariance calculations and demonstrate the concerted nature of phonon energies even at 300 K, questioning independent harmonic oscillator assumptions commonly used for phonon energy descriptions of thermodynamics and transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the model of four sublattices, the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire-Kittel phenomenological approach and the Stephenson-Highland ionic adsorption model for the description of coupled polar and antipolar long-range orders in ferroics, we calculated analytically the phase diagrams and polar properties of Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles covered by surface ions in dependence on their size, surface ions density, samarium content "x" and temperature. The size effects and ferro-ionic coupling govern the appearance and stability conditions of the long-range ordered ferroelectric, reentrant ferrielectric and antiferroelectric phases in the Bi1-xSmxFeO3 nanoparticles. Calculated phase diagrams are in a qualitative agreement with the X-ray diffraction phase analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, infra-red spectroscopy and electrophysical measurements of the Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanopowders sintered by the solution combustion method. The combined theoretical-experimental approach allows to establish the influence of the ferro-ionic coupling and size effects in Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles on their polar properties.</description>

      <title>Zeoformer: Coarse-Grained Periodic Graph Transformer for OSDA-Zeolite Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, the International Zeolite Association Structure Commission (IZA-SC) has cataloged merely 255 distinct zeolite structures, with millions of theoretically possible structures yet to be discovered. The synthesis of a specific zeolite typically necessitates the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), since the selectivity for a particular zeolite is largely determined by the affinity between the OSDA and the zeolite. Therefore, finding the best affinity OSDA-zeolite pair is the key to the synthesis of targeted zeolite. However, OSDA-zeolite pairs frequently exhibit complex geometric structures, i.e., a complex crystal structure formed by a large number of atoms. Although some existing machine learning methods can represent the periodicity of crystals, they cannot accurately represent crystal structures with local variability. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Zeoformer, which can effectively represent coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability. Zeoformer reconstructs the unit cell centered around each atom and encodes the pairwise distances between this central atom and other atoms within the reconstructed unit cell. The introduction of pairwise distances within the reconstructed unit cell more effectively represents the overall structure of the unit cell and the differences between different unit cells, enabling the model to more accurately and efficiently predict the properties of OSDA-zeolite pairs and general crystal structures. Through comprehensive evaluation, our Zeoformer model demonstrates the best performance on OSDA-zeolite pair datasets and two types of crystal material datasets.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and rheological training and memory of nanocolloidal soft glasses under cyclic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An intrinsic feature of disordered and out-of-equilibrium materials, such as glasses, is the dependence of their properties on their history. An important example is rheological memory, in which disordered solids obtain properties based on their mechanical history. Here, we employ x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) with \textit{in situ} rheometry to characterize memory formation in a nanocolloidal soft glass due to cyclic shear. During a cycle, particles undergo irreversible displacements composed of a combination of shear-induced diffusion and strain fields. The magnitudes of these displacements decrease with each cycle before reaching a steady state where the microstructure has become trained to achieve enhanced reversibility. The displacements resemble a random walk in which the directions in each cycle are independent of those in preceding cycles. Accompanying the training is a steady decrease in the dissipation during each cycle towards a steady state value. Memory of this training is revealed by measurements in which the amplitude of the shear is changed after steady state is reached. The magnitude of the particle displacements as well as the dissipation and the change in residual stress vary non-monotonically with the new strain amplitude, having minima near the training amplitude, thereby revealing both microscopic and macroscopic signatures of memory.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spin-Lattice Coupling and Statistical Interpretation for the Molecular-Like Excitations in Frustrated Pyrochlores</title>

Abstract: Emergent molecular-like excitations have been discovered in a series of pyrochlore antiferromagnets, yet their origins and relationships with the coexisting magnon excitations remain a puzzle. Here, by incorporating the dynamic spin-lattice coupling through the site-phonon model, we accomplish a unified description of the molecular and magnon excitations, which allows us to provide a statistical interpretation of the molecular-like modes. Our work also demonstrates a semiclassical approach to understand exotic spin dynamics in systems with non-bilinear spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase-field model of cavity electromagnonic systems</title>

Abstract: Cavity electromagnonic system, which simultaneously consists of cavities for photons, magnons (quanta of spin waves), and acoustic phonons, provides an exciting platform to achieve coherent energy transduction among different physical systems down to single quantum level. Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n=1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.</description>

      <title>Reference CC3 Excitation Energies for Organic Chromophores: Benchmarking TD-DFT, BSE/$GW$ and Wave Function Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To expand the QUEST database of highly-accurate vertical transition energies, we consider a series of large organic chromogens ubiquitous in dye chemistry, such as anthraquinone, azobenzene, BODIPY, and naphthalimide. We compute, at the CC3 level of theory, the singlet and triplet vertical transition energies associated with the low-lying excited states. This leads to a collection of more than 120 new highly-accurate excitation energies. Subsequently, we employ these reference values to benchmark a series of lower-order wave function approaches, including the popular ADC(2) and CC2 schemes, as well as time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), both with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). At the TD-DFT level, we evaluate a large panel of global, range-separated, local, and double hybrid functionals. Additionally, we assess the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism relying on both $G_0W_0$ and ev$GW$ quasiparticle energies evaluated from various starting points. It turns out that CC2 and ADC(2.5) are the most accurate models amongst those with respective $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scalings with system size. In contrast, CCSD does not outperform CC2. The best performing exchange-correlation functionals include BMK, M06-2X, M06-SX, CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$B97X-D, and LH20t, with average deviations of approximately 0.20 eV or slightly below. Errors on vertical excitation energies can be further reduced by considering double hybrids. Both SOS-$\omega$B88PP86 and SOS-$\omega$PBEPP86 exhibit particularly attractive performances with overall quality on par with CC2, whereas PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH are only slightly less efficient. BSE/ev$GW$ calculations based on Kohn-Sham starting points have been found to be particularly effective for singlet transitions, but much less for their triplet counterparts.</description>

      <title>Improved Uncertainty Estimation of Graph Neural Network Potentials Using Engineered Latent Space Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be astonishingly capable models for molecular property prediction, particularly as surrogates for expensive density functional theory calculations of relaxed energy for novel material discovery. However, one limitation of GNNs in this context is the lack of useful uncertainty prediction methods, as this is critical to the material discovery pipeline. In this work, we show that uncertainty quantification for relaxed energy calculations is more complex than uncertainty quantification for other kinds of molecular property prediction, due to the effect that structure optimizations have on the error distribution. We propose that distribution-free techniques are more useful tools for assessing calibration, recalibrating, and developing uncertainty prediction methods for GNNs performing relaxed energy calculations. We also develop a relaxed energy task for evaluating uncertainty methods for equivariant GNNs, based on distribution-free recalibration and using the Open Catalyst Project dataset. We benchmark a set of popular uncertainty prediction methods on this task, and show that latent distance methods, with our novel improvements, are the most well-calibrated and economical approach for relaxed energy calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that our latent space distance method produces results which align with our expectations on a clustering example, and on specific equation of state and adsorbate coverage examples from outside the training dataset.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>
