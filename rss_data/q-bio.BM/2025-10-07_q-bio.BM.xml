      <title>NS-Pep: De novo Peptide Design with Non-Standard Amino Acids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptide drugs incorporating non-standard amino acids (NSAAs) offer improved binding affinity and improved pharmacological properties. However, existing peptide design methods are limited to standard amino acids, leaving NSAA-aware design largely unexplored. We introduce NS-Pep, a unified framework for co-designing peptide sequences and structures with NSAAs. The main challenge is that NSAAs are extremely underrepresented-even the most frequent one, SEP, accounts for less than 0.4% of residues-resulting in a severe long-tailed distribution. To improve generalization to rare amino acids, we propose Residue Frequency-Guided Modification (RFGM), which mitigates over-penalization through frequency-aware logit calibration, supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis. Furthermore, we identify that insufficient side-chain modeling limits geometric representation of NSAAs. To address this, we introduce Progressive Side-chain Perception (PSP) for coarse-to-fine torsion and location prediction, and Interaction-Aware Weighting (IAW) to emphasize pocket-proximal residues. Moreover, NS-Pep generalizes naturally to the peptide folding task with NSAAs, addressing a major limitation of current tools. Experiments show that NS-Pep improves sequence recovery rate and binding affinity by 6.23% and 5.12%, respectively, and outperforms AlphaFold3 by 17.76% in peptide folding success rate.</description>

      <title>Relief of EGFR/FOS-downregulated miR-103a by loganin alleviates NF-kappaB-triggered inflammation and gut barrier disruption in colitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the ever-rising global incidence rate of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the lack of effective clinical treatment drugs, elucidating the detailed pathogenesis, seeking novel targets, and developing promising drugs are the top priority for IBD treatment. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of microRNA (miR)-103a were significantly downregulated in the inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, along with elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta/TNF-alpha) and reduced tight junction protein (Occludin/ZO-1) levels, as compared with healthy control objects. Consistently, miR-103a deficient intestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 showed serious inflammatory responses and increased permeability, and DSS induced more severe colitis in miR-103a-/- mice than wild-type ones. Mechanistic studies unraveled that c-FOS suppressed miR-103a transcription via binding to its promoter, then miR-103a-targeted NF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory responses and barrier disruption by targeting TAB2 and TAK1. Notably, the traditional Chinese medicine Cornus officinalis (CO) and its core active ingredient loganin potently mitigated inflammation and barrier disruption in UC by specifically blocking the EGFR/RAS/ERK/c-FOS signaling axis, these effects mainly attributed to modulated miR-103a levels as the therapeutic activities of them were almost completely shielded in miR-103a KO mice. Taken together, this work reveals that loganin relieves EGFR/c-FOS axis-suppressed epithelial miR-103a expression, thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation, suppressing inflammatory responses, and preserving tight junction integrity in UC. Thus, our data enrich mechanistic insights and promising targets for UC treatment.</description>

      <title>Thin Bridges for Drug Text Alignment: Lightweight Contrastive Learning for Target Specific Drug Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models hold promise for drug discovery and biomedical applications, but most existing approaches rely on heavy pretraining or large scale multimodal corpora. We investigate whether thin contrastive bridges, lightweight projection heads over frozen unimodal encoders can align chemical and textual representations without training a full multimodal model. Using paired mechanisms from ChEMBL, we align ECFP4 molecular fingerprints with biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections trained with a contrastive objective. To better handle drugs sharing the same therapeutic target, we incorporate hard negative weighting and a margin loss. Evaluation under scaffold based splits, which require generalization across disjoint chemical cores, demonstrates that our approach achieves non-trivial cross modal alignment and substantially improves within target discrimination compared to frozen baselines. These results suggest that thin bridges offer a compute efficient alternative to large scale multimodal pretraining, enabling scaffold aware drug text alignment and target specific retrieval in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Twist dominates bending in the liquid crystal organization of bacteriophage DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA frequently adopts liquid-crystalline conformations in both cells and viruses. The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description of these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or cholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to dominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal modeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4, whose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase. We first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric layers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this geometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the elastic ratio $\alpha = K_3/K_2$. We find $\alpha \approx 0.0064$, indicating that twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this result, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and classify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with experimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity, topology, and observed genome organization.</description>

      <title>Impact of Force Field Polarization on Correlated Motions of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated motions of proteins underpin many physiological mechanisms, such as substrate binding, signal transduction, enzymatic activity and allostery. These motions arise from low frequency collective movements of biomolecules and have mostly been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present the effects of two different empirical energy force fields used for molecular dynamics simulations on correlated motions -- the non-polarizable CHARMM 36m additive force field and the polarizable Drude-2019 force field. The study was conducted on two proteins, ubiquitin - a small protein with a well-described dynamic - and the nuclear receptor protein PPAR___. The ligand binding domain of PPAR___ was of particular interest since its function is to regulate transcription through ligand and coregulator protein binding. It has been previously shown that a dynamical network of correlated motions ensures the transmission of information related to PPAR___ ligand binding. We present the results of classical MD simulations where we analyze the results in terms of residue fluctuations, residue correlation maps, community network analysis and hydrophobic cluster analysis. We find that RMS fluctuations tend to be greater and correlated motions are less intense with Drude-2019 force field than with the non-polarizable all atom additive force field. Analysis of large hydrophobic clusters in the respective proteins show a greater loss of native contacts in the simulations using the Drude-2019 force field than in the simulations using the all atom force additive force field. Our results provide the first quantification of the impact of using a polarizable force field in computational studies that focus on correlated motions.</description>

      <title>UniSim: A Unified Simulator for Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding the atomic-level behavior of molecular systems, giving insights into their transitions and interactions. However, classical MD techniques are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, while recent deep learning-based improvements have mostly focused on single-domain molecules, lacking transferability to unfamiliar molecular systems. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{Sim}ulator (UniSim), which leverages cross-domain knowledge to enhance the understanding of atomic interactions. First, we employ a multi-head pretraining approach to learn a unified atomic representation model from a large and diverse set of molecular data. Then, based on the stochastic interpolant framework, we learn the state transition patterns over long timesteps from MD trajectories, and introduce a force guidance module for rapidly adapting to different chemical environments. Our experiments demonstrate that UniSim achieves highly competitive performance across small molecules, peptides, and proteins.</description>

      <title>FLOWR.root: A flow matching based foundation model for joint multi-purpose structure-aware 3D ligand generation and affinity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present FLOWR:root, an equivariant flow-matching model for pocket-aware 3D ligand generation with joint binding affinity prediction and confidence estimation. The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. FLOWR:root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, FLOWR:root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2$\alpha$ ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ER$\alpha$ and TYK2 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, FLOWR:root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.</description>
