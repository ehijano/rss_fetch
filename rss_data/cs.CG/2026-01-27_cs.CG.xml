      <title>Manifold-based Proving Methods in Projective Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article compares different proving methods for projective incidence theorems. In particular, a technique using quadrilateral tilings recently introduced by Sergey Fomin and Pavlo Pylyavskyy is shown to be at most as strong as proofs using bi-quadratic final polynomials and thus, also proofs using Ceva-Menelaus-tilings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the equivalence between quadrilateral-tiling-proofs and proofs using exclusively Menelaus configurations. We exemplify the transition between the proofs in several examples in 2D and in 3D.</description>

      <title>Smooth Fractal Trees: Analytic Generators and Discrete Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for constructing fractal trees via analytic generator fields, replacing discrete affine transformations and symbolic rewriting rules by the integration of smooth vector fields in an internal state space. In this setting, geometric curves are obtained as projections of generator trajectories, and branching is implemented as a primitive operation through exact inheritance of generator state.
  At every finite depth, the resulting structure is a finite union of analytic curve segments that is smooth across branch events. Two structural results relate this generator-driven construction to classical discrete models of tree-based fractals. First, a combinatorial universality theorem shows that any discrete tree specification, including those arising from iterated function systems and L-systems, can be compiled into an analytic generator tree whose induced discrete scaffold is isomorphic at every finite depth. Second, under standard contractive assumptions, a canopy set equivalence theorem establishes that the accumulation set of analytic branch endpoints coincides with the attractor of the corresponding discrete construction.
  These results separate local geometric regularity from global fractal complexity, showing that fractality is determined by recursive branching and scaling rather than by local non-smoothness. The framework provides a smooth representation of tree-based fractals that preserves both their finite combinatorial structure and their asymptotic limit geometry.</description>

      <title>On Lines Crossing Pairwise Intersecting Convex Sets in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1913 Helly's theorem states that any family ${\cal K}$ of $n\geq d+1$ convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^d$ can be pierced by a single point if and only if any $d+1$ of ${\cal K}$'s elements can. In 2002 Alon, Kalai, Matou\v{s}ek and Meshulam ruled out the possibility of similar criteria for the existence of lines crossing multiple convex sets in dimension $d\geq 3$ -- for any $k\geq 3$, they described arbitrary large families ${\cal K}$ of convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^3$ so that any $k$ elements of ${\cal K}$ can be crossed by a line yet no $k+4$ of them can.
  Let ${\cal K}$ be a family of $n$ pairwise intersecting convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^3$. We show that there exists a line crossing $\Theta(n)$ elements of ${\cal K}$. This resolves the most extensively studied variant of a problem by Mart\'inez, Rold\'an-Pensado and Rubin (Discrete Comput. Geom. 2020) which was highlighted by B\'ar\'any and Kalai (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 2021). Our result adds to the very few sufficient (and non-trivial) conditions that have been known for the existence of line transversals to large families of convex sets.
  Our argument is based on a Ramsey-type result of independent interest for families of pairwise intersecting convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^2$, and the structure of line arrangements in ${\mathbb R}^3$.</description>
