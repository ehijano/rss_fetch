      <title>Invariant Manifolds for Capillary Waves and a Class of Quasilinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the local stable and unstable manifolds of equilibria for quasilinear and fully nonlinear PDEs. These manifolds are fundamental objects in the analysis of local dynamics. While their existence is well understood for ODEs, semilinear PDEs, and certain parabolic-type quasilinear PDEs, invariant manifold theorems are often unavailable for quasilinear PDEs whose nonlinearities involve a loss of regularity and whose linear parts do not provide sufficient smoothing.
  Our main results establish the existence, uniqueness, and smoothness of local stable and unstable manifolds for nonlinear PDEs that satisfy suitable energy estimates. With the main focus on irrotational water waves with surface tension, this framework applies to a broad class of PDEs, including nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, nonlinear wave equations, and the MMT model, as well as to certain gradient-type PDEs.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems for mixed local and nonlocal indefinite equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the qualitative properties of positive solutions to mixed local-nonlocal equations with indefinite nonlinearities, emphasizing the interaction between classical and fractional Laplacians. We first establish maximum principles and prove strict monotonicity along the $x_1$-direction for mixed elliptic operators. By combining a mollified first eigenfunction with a suitable sub-solution, we derive nonexistence results for the mixed operator $ (-\Delta)^s - \Delta$ via a contradiction argument. These results are further extended to the parabolic setting, incorporating both the Marchaud-type fractional time derivative and the classical first-order derivative, revealing new qualitative features under dual nonlocality.
  A key aspect of our approach is a careful adaptation of the method of moving planes to the mixed local-nonlocal context. By addressing the distinct scaling behaviors of local and nonlocal terms, the method yields monotonicity and Liouville-type results without standard decay assumptions, and provides a framework potentially applicable to a broader class of mixed elliptic and parabolic problems.</description>

      <title>Weakly-singular formulation of the Fractional Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new formulation of the fractional Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^s$ in $n$-dimensional space ($n \ge 1$). The proposed formulation expresses $(-\Delta)^s$ as a composition of the classical Laplace differential operator and a weakly singular integral operator -- which can be used to reduce e.g. the Dirichlet problem for the fractional Laplacian to a weakly singular integral equation involving both volumetric and boundary integral operators. This reformulation is well suited for efficient and accurate numerical implementation. Although a full description of the associated high-order algorithm is deferred to a subsequent contribution, several numerical examples are included in this paper to demonstrate the high accuracy and computational efficiency achieved by the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Carleman Semi-Discrete Convexification Method Combined With Deep Learning for Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new semi-discrete version of the Carleman estimate-based convexification globally convergent numerical method is developed. It is used for the delivery of the starting point for the training procedure of deep learning. An important feature of the continuous version of the convexification method is that its convergence to the true solution is independent on the availability of a good first guess about this solution. A new concept of the h-strong convexity is introduced, where h is the grid step size in the semi-discrete version of the convexification method. The h -strong convexity allows to obtain an a priori accuracy estimate of the starting point for the training step of the deep learning procedure. This approach is demonstrated for a highly nonlinear problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography. Results of numerical experiments for complicated media structures demonstrate the computational feasibility of this procedure.</description>

      <title>On Counterexamples to Interior $C^2$ Estimates for Monge-Amp\`ere Type Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We modify Pogorelov's classic construction to demonstrate the absence of a priori $C^2$ estimates for the equations $\det(D^2 u \pm Du \otimes Du) = f(x)$ in dimension $n \ge 3$. We construct a sequence of solutions $z_\varepsilon$ with second derivatives blowing up at the origin as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, while the corresponding right-hand sides $f_\varepsilon$ admit uniform $C^2$ estimates. Specifically, the counterexamples are given by $z_\varepsilon(x_1, \dots, x_n) = (1+x_1^2)(1+x_2^2)(\varepsilon^2 + \eta^2)^{\alpha/2},$ where $\eta = \sqrt{x_3^2 + \dots + x_n^2}$ and $\alpha = 2 - \frac{2}{n}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal eigenvalue problems and superposition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral theory of mixed local and nonlocal operators with lower-order terms in the right-hand side of the equation.
  This kind of problems is motivated by the analysis of superposition operators of mixed order and with the "wrong sign" of the lower-order terms with respect to the classical elliptic theory.
  Our results include:
  -convergence to classical cases when the right-hand side of the eigenvalye equations "localizes", recovering the simplicity and sign-definiteness of eigenfunctions in the limit;
  -a detailed analysis of disconnected domains, showing that, unlike the classical case, any eigenfunction associated with the first eigenvalue must change sign, and that the first eigenvalue of a union of disconnected domains is strictly smaller than that of its individual components;
  -examples in which the first eigenvalue is either simple or non-simple in disconnected domains;
  -a regularity theory that underpins these results.</description>

      <title>On the weighted logarithmic potential operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bounded open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\geq 2$, and for positive continuous functions $w,g$ on $\overline{\Omega}$, we consider the weighted eigenvalue problem
  \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{L}_{w} u =\tau gu,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\mathcal{L}_{w}$ is the weighted logarithmic potential operator on $L^2(\Omega)$ as defined below:
  \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{L}_{w} u(x)=\int_\Omega \log\left(\frac{w(x)w(y)}{|x-y|}\right)u(y)dy.
  \end{equation*}
  We study the monotonicity and continuity of the largest positive eigenvalue $\tau_{w,g}^+(\Omega)$ with respect to $\Omega$, $w$, and $g$. We also establish that $\tau_{w,g}^+(\Omega)$ satisfies a reverse Faber Krahn inequality under polarization. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence of a negative eigenvalue in terms of the weighted transfinite diameter of $\Omega$, under the assumption that $\log w$ is superharmonic. For $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, if $\Delta\log w $ is a constant $C$, we show that 0 can be an eigenvalue of $\mathcal{L}_{w}$ only when $C=\frac{2\pi}{|\Omega|}$. For such domains, if $\log w$ is a harmonic function on $\Omega$, we provide a representation formula for the eigenfunctions. Using this representation, we establish variants of the maximum principles that give some insight into the geometry of these eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Shape for Circular Vortex Filaments under Non-Symmetric Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the nonlinear orbital stability of circular vortex filaments governed by the Localized Induction Equation (LIE) under non-symmetric perturbations, within the framework of [Tani-Nishiyama, 1997]. This result extends the first author's recent work [Aiki, 2025] by removing symmetry assumptions on perturbations. While the circular filaments are known to be Lyapunov unstable due to linear growth of the translational mode, we prove that their shape remains globally stable modulo spatial translations and rotations about the symmetry axis. The crucial ingredient is a geometric stability lemma derived from the conservation of vector fluid impulse, which constrains the low-frequency modulations that are not covered by the relative energy.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal-to-local $L^p$-convergence of convolution operators with singular, anisotropic kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlocal convolution-type operators with singular, possibly anisotropic kernels. Our main objective is to establish and quantify their nonlocal-to-local convergence to a local differential operator with natural boundary conditions, as the kernels concentrate at the origin in a suitable way. Such convergence results provide a useful tool for the physical justification of mathematical models, particularly in situations where the desired local differential operator cannot be directly derived from microscopic laws. The present work substantially extends previous results by allowing kernels with stronger singularities (comparable to those of fractional Laplacians), anisotropic and non-localized kernels, and by proving strong convergence in general $L^p$ spaces together with explicit convergence rates.</description>

      <title>On the shape of minimizers for the periodic nonlocal perimeter in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study planar nonlocal Delaunay sets. That is, open sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with constant nonlocal mean curvature that are periodic in $x_1$, and even in $x_1$ and in $x_2$. Using bifurcation analysis and fine explicit computations, we prove that every sufficiently $C^{1,\beta}$-flat nonlocal Delaunay set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that is not a straight band is unstable with respect to volume-preserving periodic variations.
  Our results support the conjecture that, as in the local case, in the range of large areas, minimizers of the periodic nonlocal isoperimetric problem -- also known as the nonlocal liquid drop problem with prescribed area between two parallel hyperplanes -- are all straight bands.</description>

      <title>Periodic Delaunay cylinders with constant anisotropic nonlocal mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove existence and symmetry properties of periodic surfaces of revolution with constant anisotropic nonlocal mean curvature, generalizing a classical result of Delaunay to the anisotropic nonlocal setting.
  First, by studying the corresponding periodic isoperimetric problem, under natural assumptions on the kernel, we use rearrangement inequalities to extend a periodic version of the Wulff inequality to the nonlocal setting. This leads to the existence and symmetry properties of minimizers for every given volume in each period, thus generalizing the results of Cabr\'e, Csat\'o, and Mas to the anisotropic case.
  Second, under the same hypotheses on the kernel, we prove the existence of a one-parameter family of Delaunay near-cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^2$ bifurcating from a straight cylinder and having each constant anisotropic mean curvature. This extends the results of Cabr\'e, Fall, Sol\`a-Morales, and Weth to the anisotropic case. The stability of these near-cylinders will be studied in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Overdetermined problems for the rotationally invariant Poisson equation in model manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present rigidity results for overdetermined problems associated to the rotationally invariant Poisson equation $-\Delta_{g_\mathcal{M}} u = f(r)$ in a model manifold $\mathcal{M} = [0,S) \times_h \mathbb S^{N-1}$ with warping function $h$. The variable $r$ ranges in the interval $[0,S)$, whose endpoint $S$ is positive and possibly infinite. The first part of the paper deals with the problem \[
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta_{g_\mathcal{M}} {u}=f(r) &amp;\mbox{in $\Omega$},
  u=\varphi(r) &amp;\mbox{on $\partial \Omega$},
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \kappa(r) &amp;\mbox{on $\partial \Omega$},
  \end{array} \] where $\Omega \subset \mathcal{M}$ is a bounded domain containing the point $O \in \mathcal{M}$ corresponding to $r = 0$, $\nu$ is the exterior unit normal vector on $\partial \Omega$, and $f$, $\varphi$, $\kappa$ are three prescribed functions.
  In the second part of the paper, we consider a similar overdetermined problem for the exterior Bernoulli problem in a domain $\Omega \setminus \overline B_{R_0}(O)$, where $B_{R_0}(O)$ denotes the geodesic ball centered at $O$ with radius $R_0$, within the class of functions that vanish on $\partial B_{R_0}(O)$. In both cases, we give conditions on $f$, $\varphi$ and $\kappa$ implying that the solution $u$ is radial and $\Omega$ is a geodesic ball centered at $O$. Our results apply in particular to the three space forms $\mathbb{R}^N$, $\mathbb{H}^N$ and $\mathbb{S}^N$.</description>

      <title>Limiting Absorption Principle and Radiation Condition for the Fractional Helmholtz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate elliptic fractional equations in the whole space, involving zero order perturbations of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$. Our main objective is to determine appropriate radiation conditions at infinity that ensure existence and uniqueness of solutions to the fractional type Helmholtz equation. Extending classical scattering theory for the Helmholtz equation, we introduce and analyze suitable Sommerfeld type radiation conditions for fractional orders. A central contribution is the explicit computation of the outgoing free space Greens function for the operator $(-\Delta)^s-k^{2s}$, for all $0&lt;s&lt;1$, any dimension and $k&gt;0$, obtained via contour integration and a limiting absorption principle. We show that its asymptotic behavior at infinity coincides with a rescaled version of the classical Helmholtz fundamental solution, thereby justifying the standard Sommerfeld radiation condition for compactly supported sources. In addition, using resolvent estimates and a limiting absorption framework, we establish existence and uniqueness of outgoing solutions for compactly supported data, and for weighted sources. We further derive a convolution representation of the solution in terms of the outgoing fundamental solution. For inhomogeneous media with compactly supported perturbations, we reformulate the problem as a Lippmann Schwinger integral equation of Fredholm type and prove unique solvability away from a discrete set of frequencies. Our analysis provides a rigorous foundation for scattering theory of fractional Helmholtz operators and offers a framework suitable for numerical implementation of these nonlocal wave propagation models.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction algorithms for the fractional Laplacian and applications to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two reconstruction schemes that enable the recovery of a function in the entire Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ from local data $(u|_W, [(-\Delta)^s u]|_W)$, where $W$ is an arbitrarily small nonempty open subset of $\mathbb R^n$ and $(-\Delta)^s$ denotes the fractional Laplace operator of order $s\in (0,1)$. These procedures rely crucially on the weak Unique Continuation Property (UCP) for the fractional Laplacian. We apply these schemes to two distinct inverse problems. Following the seminal work from Ghosh et al., the first one concerns the recovery of a potential (Calder\'on-type problem) from the fractional Schr\"odinger equation under nonlocal Robin-type exterior conditions. The second one involves recovering the solution of the space-fractional heat equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ from localized time-dependent measurements within a ball. To tackle these problems, we introduce new analytical tools such as a generalized weak Kelvin transform and a fractional Robin-to-Robin map. Finally, we provide numerical simulations for one of the reconstruction methods, illustrating the stability issues and the severe ill-posedness inherent to such inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A stochastic Schauder-Tychonoff type theorem and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One standard way to prove existence for deterministic, highly nonlinear PDEs is to use the Schauder-Tychonoff fixed-point theorem. In what follows, we introduce and verify a stochastic variant of the Schauder-Tychonoff theorem. We apply our existence result to nonlinear stochastic diffusion equations with non-Lipschitz perturbations</description>

      <title>Variational optimization approach for reconstruction of dielectric permittivity and conductivity functions using partial boundary measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a variational optimization approach for the solution of a coefficient inverse problem of simultaneous reconstruction of the dielectric permittivity and conductivity functions in time-dependent Maxwell's system using limited boundary observations of the electric field.
  The variational optimization approach is based on constructing a weak form of a Lagrangian which allows to use finite element based reconstruction algorithms.
  The optimality conditions for the Lagrangian and stability estimate for the adjoint problem are derived, as well as Frech\'et differentiability of it and of the regularized Tikhonov functional are also presented. Two- and three-dimensional numerical studies confirm our theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of finite element schemes for the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetisation in a bounded ferromagnet in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2$) at high temperatures can be described by the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, which is a vector-valued quasilinear stochastic partial differential equation. In this paper, assuming adequate regularity of the initial data, we establish strong convergence in $L^2(\Omega)$ of several semi-implicit and implicit fully discrete finite element schemes for the sLLB equation, together with explicit convergence rates. The analysis relies on localised error estimates and new exponential moment bounds for the exact solution. As a by-product, these moment bounds yield mean-square exponential stability of solutions and uniqueness of the invariant measure in one spatial dimension under a small noise assumption. We also sharpen existing convergence-in-probability results for the numerical schemes. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine some shape functionals, introduced by P\'olya and Makai, involving the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet-Laplacian eigenvalue for bounded, open and convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We establish new quantitative bounds, which give us key properties and information on the behavior of the optimizing sequences. In particular, we consider two kinds of reminder terms that provide information about the structure of these minimizing sequences, such as information about the thickness.</description>

      <title>Extremal domains in $\mathbb{S}^2$: Geometric and Analytic methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{S}^2$ that support positive solutions of the overdetermined problem $$ \Delta u + f(u,|\nabla u|)=0 \quad \text{in } \Omega, $$ subject to the boundary conditions $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$ and $|\nabla u|$ being locally constant along $\partial\Omega$. We refer to such domains as $f$--extremal domains.
  In the first part of the paper, we extend the moving plane method in $\mathbb{S}^2$ and show that if an $f$--extremal domain $\Omega$ contains a simple curve of maximum points of $u$, then both $\Omega$ and $u$ are either rotationally symmetric or antipodally symmetric. Using the Alexandrov reflection method, we establish an analogous symmetry result for properly embedded constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces with capillary boundaries that contain a simple curve of minimum distance to the origin (a neck).
  In the second part, we strengthen these conclusions for specific nonlinearities, including the eigenvalue problem ($f(x)=\lambda x$), the Serrin problem ($f(x)=\lambda x + c$), harmonic domains ($f(x)=c$), and nonlinearities of the form $f(x)=\lambda x + x^\beta$, for constants $\lambda \geq 2$, $c \geq 0$, and $\beta \in (0,1)$. In these cases, we prove that the domain $\Omega$ must be rotationally symmetric.
  Throughout the paper, we restrict our attention to the analytic setting in order to simplify the exposition and highlight the main ideas.</description>

Abstract: We consider the electron magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the context where the 3D magnetic field depends only on the two horizontal plane variables. In particular, the magnetic field takes the form $B=\nabla\times (a\vec e_z)+b\vec e_z$ with $a=a(x,y)$ and $b=b(x,y)$. Initial data $(a_0,b_0)$ is constructed in the Sobolev space $H^\beta \times H^{\beta-1}$ with $1&lt;\beta&lt;4$ such that the solution to this electron MHD system either escapes the space or develops norm inflation in $\dot H^\beta \times \dot H^{\beta-1}$.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow perspective on McKean-Vlasov equations in econophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Gini coefficient of economic inequality is a Lyapunov functional for a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential equations arising at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and statistical physics. Next, a novel Riemannian geometry is imposed on a subset of probability densities such that the evolutionary dynamics are formally driven by the Gini coefficient functional as a gradient flow. Thus in the same way that classical 2-Wasserstein theory connects heat flow and the Second Law of Thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the work here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient.
  The noncanonical Onsager operators associated to the metric tensors are derived and some transport inequalities proven. The new metric relates to the dual norm of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space, in a similar way to how the classical 2-Wasserstein metric linearizes as the dual norm of a first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze operators H = a^{ij}(x,t) X_i X_j - d/dt (having adopted Einstein's convention on repeated indexes), where the X_i's are H\"ormander vector fields generating a Carnot group and A = [a_{ij}] is a symmetric and uniformly positive-definite matrix whose entries satisfy double Dini continuity, a strictly weaker condition than H\"older continuity. For these operators, we build a fundamental solution and show a two-sided Gaussian estimate for the latter, as well as upper Gaussian estimates for its derivatives up to weight 2. As a consequence of the whole procedure, we prove an existence result for the related Cauchy problem, under a Dini-type condition on the source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, a perturbation theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $(n \geq 3)$ is studied to investigate decay estimate of solutions around a non-constant state. As a concrete problem, stability is considered for a perturbation system from a stationary solution $u_\omega$ belonging to the weak $L^n$ space. Decay rates of the perturbation including $L^\infty$ norm are obtained which coincide with those of the heat kernel except a bit loss. The proof is based on deriving suitable resolvent estimates with perturbation terms in the low frequency part having a parabolic spectral curve. Our method can be applicable to dispersive hyperbolic systems like wave equations with strong damping. Indeed, a parabolic type decay rate of a solution is obtained for a damped wave equation including variable coefficients which satisfy spatial decay conditions.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability of a Degenerate Euler-Bernoulli Beam with Axial Force and Delayed Boundary Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the global exponential stabilization of a degenerate Euler-Bernoulli beam subjected to a non uniform axial force and a delayed feedback control. First, we address the well-posedness of the system by constructing an appropriate energy space in weighted Sobolev settings. Using L\"umer-Phillips theorem, we prove that the linear operator associated with the problem generates a $\mathcal{C}_0$-semigroup of contractions. Next, we establish the uniform exponential stability of the system. By constructing a novel Lyapunov functional incorporating weighted integral terms, we demonstrate that the energy of the system exponentially decays to zero and derive a precise decay rate estimate. This work provides a significant extension to the stability theory for complex distributed parameter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by adapting the perturbation method, we study normalized standing wave solutions for the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky system:
  - Delta u + q(x) phi u = omega u + f(u) in Omega, - Delta phi + a^2 Delta^2 phi = q(x) u^2 in Omega,
  where Omega is a smooth bounded domain in R^3, a &gt; 0, and omega is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the L^2 mass constraint integral over Omega of u^2 equals mu, and f: R -&gt; R is a continuous function satisfying some technical conditions. We introduce a perturbation framework for the problem and investigate normalized solutions. In particular, we prove the existence of normalized solutions for all masses mu in an interval (0, mu_0), under either Navier or Neumann boundary conditions for phi. Moreover, when f is odd, we obtain multiplicity of normalized solutions; and if Omega is star-shaped, we further obtain a normalized ground state solution.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Stochastic Evolution Equations in the Critical Variational Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16622v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise. Since our framework includes the 2D Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations with gradient noise and unbounded domains, our results resolve an open problem that has remained unsolved for over 15 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of compactness of Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on the entire space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces. We avoid any unnecessary restrictions and cover also embeddings of higher order, providing a complete picture within this framework. To achieve this, we need to develop new techniques because the usual techniques used in the study of compactness of Sobolev embeddings in the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces are limited to domains of finite measure, which is essential for them to work. Furthermore, we also study certain weighted Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on balls, where the weight is a nonnegative power of the distance from the origin. We completely characterize their compactness and also describe optimal target rearrangement-invariant function spaces in these weighted Sobolev embeddings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$ of the form $$\|(-\Delta_k)^s(fg)\|_{L^p(d\mu_k)} \lesssim \|(-\Delta_k)^s f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)} \|g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)} + \|f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)} \|(-\Delta_k)^s g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)}.$$ Our approach relies on adapting the classical paraproduct decomposition to the Dunkl setting. In the process, we develop several new auxiliary results. Specifically, we show that for a Schwartz function $f$, the function $(-\Delta_k)^s f$ satisfies a pointwise decay estimate; we establish a version of almost orthogonality estimates adapted to the Dunkl framework; and we investigate the boundedness of Dunkl paraproduct operators on the Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Threshold Hierarchy for Packet-Scale Boundary Cancellation of Dirichlet Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11605v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify geometry--dependent minimal packet scales required for cancellation of boundary correlations of high--frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions on smooth strictly convex domains. The main result is a threshold hierarchy: for zero--mean boundary weights, the energy--weighted packet average of boundary correlation coefficients vanishes once the packet length exceeds a scale determined by the vanishing order of curvature moments of the weight. In particular, the threshold $N_k/k^{1-2/d}\to\infty$ suffices when $\int_{\partial\Omega} w,d\sigma=0$, while a strictly weaker threshold applies when additionally $\int_{\partial\Omega} H,w,d\sigma=0$, reducing in dimension $d=3$ to the minimal condition $N_k\to\infty$. The thresholds follow from the boundary local Weyl law. As a structural consequence of the Rellich identity alone, the single--mode share of boundary energy within any sublinear spectral packet is of order $1/N_k$. All estimates are independent of eigenvalue monotonicity and remain stable under eigenvalue crossings.</description>

      <title>Sobolev multipliers and fractional Gaussian fields on Lipschitz boundaries with applications to deterministic and random acoustic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Applied Physics and Photonics studies of random resonators, we study in the stochastic part of this paper random acoustic operators in non-smooth bounded domains $G \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and introduce m-dissipative impedance boundary conditions containing (eigenfunction) fractional Gaussian fields. The deterministic part of the paper constructs and studies the spaces of pointwise multipliers on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$, as well as the spaces of Sobolev (distribution-type) multipliers on boundaries $\partial G$ of better regularity. These multipliers are used as generalized impedance coefficients $\zeta$ in impedance boundary conditions $\zeta p = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v}$ accompanying the 1st order acoustic system. We study the m-dissipativity of associated acoustic operators and the discreteness of their spectra aiming the main efforts on the weakest possible assumptions on the regularity of $\zeta$. In order to pass from deterministic results to the randomization, we introduce fractional Gaussian fields (FGFs) on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$ and study their regularity. To this end, we prove that a rough Weyl-type asymptotics takes place for the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues on arbitrary compact Lipschitz boundary $\partial G$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>
