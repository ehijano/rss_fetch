      <title>The 1979 Iranian Revolution and the Lost Decade of Science: A Counterfactual Scientometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the long-term impact of the 1979 Iranian Revolution on the nation scientific development. Using Scopus-indexed data from 1960 to 2024, we benchmark Iran publication trajectory against a carefully selected peer group representing diverse development models, established scientific leaders, Netherlands, stable regional powers, Israel, and high-growth, Asian Tigers, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore alongside Greece and China. The analysis reveals a stark divergence, in the late 1970s, Iran scientific output surpassed that of South Korea, China and Taiwan. The revolution, however, precipitated a collapse, followed by a lost decade of stagnation, precisely when its Asian peers began an unprecedented, state driven ascent. We employ counterfactual models based on pre revolutionary growth trends to quantify the resulting knowledge deficit. The findings suggest that, in an alternate, stable timeline, Iran scientific output could have rivaled South Korea today. We further outline a research agenda to analyze normalized impact metrics, such as FWCI, and collaboration patterns, complementing our findings on publication volume. By contextualizing Iran unique trajectory, this study contributes to a broader understanding of the divergent recovery patterns exhibited by national scientific systems following profound political shocks, offering insights into the enduring consequences of historical disruptions on the global scientific landscape.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Climate Change on Photovoltaic Potential in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Africa holds the world's highest solar irradiance yet has &lt;2% of global photovoltaic (PV) capacity, leaving 600 million people without electricity access. However, climate change impacts on its 10 TW potential remain understudied. Using four decades of ERA5 reanalysis data (1980-2020) at 0.25 degree resolution, we quantify the contributions of key climate factors to historical changes in African PV potential through multivariate decomposition. Continental PV potential increased by 3.2%, driven primarily by enhanced solar radiation (+1.2 degree Celsius, contributing -23%). East Africa gained &gt;6% from radiation enhancement, while North Africa declined by 0.5% as extreme heat (+2 degree Celsius) overwhelmed radiation benefits. Critically, stability analysis using the coefficient of variation (CV) reveals that high-irradiance subtropical zones are highly variable (CV=0.4), in contrast to stable equatorial regions (CV=0.1), challenging the assumption that resource abundance ensures reliability. These findings reframe Africa's solar strategy: North Africa requires prioritizing heat-resilient technology over capacity maximization; subtropical zones demand grid-storage co-investment; and East Africa presents globally competitive opportunities for rapid, stable deployment. By resolving spatiotemporal heterogeneities and quantifying climate-driver contributions, our analysis provides an actionable framework for climate-resilient solar deployment, critical for Africa's energy transition and climate mitigation.</description>

      <title>Butterfly: glo-cal effects of data, energy and industry, New Media and Performance Exhibition Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exhibition Butterfly: Glo-cal Effects of Data, Energy, and Industry is, at its core, a meditation on entanglement-between the global and the local, the ecological and the digital, the material and the virtual. It asks how we might reframe the infrastructures that shape our lives not only as technologies of efficiency or convenience, but as ecosystems themselves: dynamic, interdependent, and in need of care. It emerges from a prior exhibition, EcoDigital Futures, presented as part of Melbourne Design Week 2024, an Australian initiative of Creative Victoria and the National Gallery of Australia. That landmark exhibition spotlighted the growing imperative to align our digital futures with ecological sensibilities. Butterfly carries forward this vision, but also intensifies it by shifting the focus from speculation to activation, from theory to lived intervention.</description>

      <title>MacroEnergy.jl: A large-scale multi-sector energy system framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MacroEnergy.jl (aka Macro) is an open-source framework for multi-sector capacity expansion modeling and analysis of macro-energy systems. It is written in Julia and uses the JuMP package to interface with a wide range of mathematical solvers. It enables researchers and practitioners to design and analyze energy and industrial systems that span electricity, fuels, bioenergy, steel, chemicals, and other sectors. The framework is organized around a small set of sector-agnostic components that can be combined into flexible graph structures, making it straightforward to extend to new technologies, policies, and commodities. Its companion packages support decomposition methods and other advanced techniques, allowing users to scale models across fine temporal and spatial resolutions. MacroEnergy.jl provides a versatile platform for studying energy transitions at the detail and scale demanded by modern research and policy.</description>

      <title>Directionality-induced jamming in multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diffusion on multiplex networks with directed interlayer couplings. We demonstrate both numerically and analytically that even with undirected layers, interlayer directionality alone reproduces superdiffusion and the prime regime. We further reveal a new phenomenon, the directionality-induced jamming, whereby directed interlayer links hinder diffusion, fragmenting the system into dynamically disconnected components and preventing convergence to the steady state of the diffusion process. Via an optimization process, we show that this new regime is attainable in both toy models and real-world topologies. These findings underscore the crucial role of interlayer link directionality in shaping the emergent behavior of multiplex systems, with potential implications for the design and control of such systems.</description>

      <title>Larger holes as narrower degree distributions in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the analysis of loops is not so much because of the complications, it has already been found that heuristically enhancing loops decreases the variance of degree distributions for improving the robustness of connectivity. While many real scale-free networks are known to contain shorter loops such as triangles, it remains to investigate the distributions of longer loops in more wide class of networks. We find a relation between narrower degree distributions and longer loops in investigating the lengths of the shortest loops in various networks with continuously changing degree distributions, including three typical types of scale-free networks, classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and regular networks. In particular, we show that narrower degree distributions contain longer shortest loops, as a universal property in a wide class of random networks. We suggest that the robustness of connectivity is enhanced by constructing long loops of O(log N).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Growth and Vari-linear Preferential Attachment in Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random networks are convenient foundational platforms widely employed in network experiments. Generating networks that more accurately reflect real-world patterns is a significant topic within complex network research. This work propose a new network formation model: the vari-linear network, which includes two core mechanisms: exponential probabilistic growth and vari-linear preferential attachment. It overcomes the limitation of traditional growth mechanism in characterising low-degree distributions. And confirms that controlling the extent of non-linear in preferential attachment is key to achieving a better fit to the real network's degree distribution pattern. The results show that the vari-linear network model maintains high fitting accuracy across multiple real-world networks of varying types and scales. And exhibits several-fold performance advantages over traditional methods. Meanwhile, it provides a unified theoretical explanation for classic topological characteristics such as small-world networks and scale-free networks. It not only provides a more quality foundational network framework for network research, but also serve as the brand new paradigm for bridging the conceptual divide between various classical network models.</description>

      <title>Case Study of a 75-Year-Old Woman with Parkinson's Disease: Rehabilitation Trajectory with Logic Workout Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the single-case trajectory of a 75-year-old retired occupational female therapist with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 at diagnosis. Following progressive impairment despite standard care, she initiated training with Logic Workout (LW) in July 2025 under supervision. Within weeks, she reported meaningful improvements spanning motor function, posture, pain, fine motor skill, mood, sleep consolidation, and disappearing of fatigue. Although single cases cannot establish generalizable efficacy, systematic and chronological documentation can be valuable for hypothesis generation and feasibility assessment in real-world settings prior to controlled trials. We summarize the baseline condition and treatment history, describe the LW intervention, compile self-reported outcomes, and interpret the findings in light of the underlying Logic Workout hypothesis, before concluding with key caveats and perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Group size effects and collective misalignment in LLM multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding across domains, introducing dynamics not captured by single-agent evaluations. Yet, existing work has mostly contrasted the behavior of a single agent with that of a collective of fixed size, leaving open a central question: how does group size shape dynamics? Here, we move beyond this dichotomy and systematically explore outcomes across the full range of group sizes. We focus on multi-agent misalignment, building on recent evidence that interacting LLMs playing a simple coordination game can generate collective biases absent in individual models. First, we show that collective bias is a deeper phenomenon than previously assessed: interaction can amplify individual biases, introduce new ones, or override model-level preferences. Second, we demonstrate that group size affects the dynamics in a non-linear way, revealing model-dependent dynamical regimes. Finally, we develop a mean-field analytical approach and show that, above a critical population size, simulations converge to deterministic predictions that expose the basins of attraction of competing equilibria. These findings establish group size as a key driver of multi-agent dynamics and highlight the need to consider population-level effects when deploying LLM-based systems at scale.</description>

      <title>Global Streams, Local Currents: A Data Analysis on Global VOD Content Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores global video on demand content consumption patterns through a network-based approach. We used Netflix's 'TV-shows' ranking data, spanning 822 days across 71 countries, to construct a network where countries are represented as nodes and consumption similarities are reflected as link weights. By applying the Louvain algorithm, we identified three distinct consumption groups, 'North America and Pan-Europe', 'Asia and Middle East', and 'Central and South America group'. These groups align closely with geographic, historical, and linguistic divisions, despite no predefined grouping criteria. Notably, Turkiye, often considered a cultural and regional crossroads, exhibited some classification ambiguity but was ultimately grouped with Asia and Middle East. Our findings also show that the United States accounts for the largest share of content consumption across all groups, while South Korean content, particularly after the success of "Squid Game" in 2021, has gained and maintained popularity in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. This study, based on data, demonstrates that deep-seated cultural histories continue to shape global consumption patterns, even amidst rapid changes in media platforms and content production dynamics.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Larger cities, more commuters, more crime? The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their roles within wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this interconnectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. In this work, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population-crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher levels of burglary, drug possession, robbery, shoplifting, and theft. For example, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population size constant. We demonstrate that models incorporating both population size and commuter inflows explain variation in these offenses better than population-only models. Our findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population-crime relationship.</description>

      <title>Patterns and Dynamics of Netflix TV Show Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of platforms like Netflix has expanded the possibility for audiences worldwide to watch the same content simultaneously, motivating research on cross-country media consumption. We investigate the global dynamics of media consumption by analyzing daily top-ranked Netflix TV shows across 71 countries over a span of 822 days. Using an information-theoretic framework, we measure diversity, similarity, and directional relationships in consumption trends using Shannon entropy, mutual information, and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. According to Shannon entropy analysis, North America and Europe have highly dynamic viewing preferences, whereas East and Southeast Asia (ESA) display more persistent trends, with the same shows often dominating for long periods. Mutual information identifies clear regional clusters of synchronized consumption, with particularly strong alignment among ESA countries. To analyze temporal patterns, we introduce a KL-based asymmetry measure that captures directional patterns between countries, applicable to both inter- and intra-regional pairs. This analysis reveals distinct pathways of content spread. We find inter-regional patterns from ESA and South America toward North America and Europe, and intra-regional signals from Korea and Thailand to other ESA countries. We also observe that ESA trends reaching other regions often originate from Singapore. These findings offer insight into the temporal structure of global content spread and highlight the coexistence of global synchronization and regional independence in streaming media preferences.</description>

      <title>Planning for future EV charging infrastructure: A city-scale assessment of demand and capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes the first demand-driven, multi-objective planning model for optimizing city-scale capacity allocation of EV charging infrastructure. The model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a rapidly expanding EV industry cluster in China with a strong industrial base, supportive policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from 18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide (ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2; (2) 181,622 additional charging piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, with the fastest growth observed in Yubei, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes areas with higher population density, higher income levels, and adequate land availability for pile deployment, rather than broad geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area, the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic, geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the transportation sector.</description>

Abstract: In light of the increase in frequency of extreme heat events, there is a critical need to develop tools to identify geographic locations that are at risk of heat-related mortality. This paper aims to identify locations by assessing holes in cooling-center coverage using persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis (TDA). Persistent homology has shown promising results in identifying holes in coverage of specific resources. We adapt these methods using a witness complex construction to study the coverage of cooling centers. We test our approach on four locations (central Boston, MA; central Austin, TX; Portland, OR; and Miami, FL) and use death times, a measurement of the size and scale of the gap in coverage, to identify most at risk regions. For comparison, we implement a standard technique for studying the risk of heat-related mortality called a heat vulnerability index (HVI). The HVI is a numerical score calculated for a geographic area based on demographic information. PH and the HVI identify different locations as vulnerable, thus indicating a potential value of assessing vulnerability from multiple perspectives. By using the regions identified by both persistent homology and the HVI, we provide a more holistic understanding of coverage.</description>

      <title>Multiplexing in Networks and Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social and economic networks are often multiplexed, meaning that people are connected by different types of relationships -- such as borrowing goods and giving advice. We make two contributions to the study of multiplexing and the understanding of simple versus complex contagion. On the theoretical side, we introduce a model and theoretical results about diffusion in multiplex networks. We show that multiplexing impedes the spread of simple contagions, such as diseases or basic information that only require one interaction to transmit an infection. We show, however that multiplexing enhances the spread of a complex contagion when infection rates are low, but then impedes complex contagion if infection rates become high. On the empirical side, we document empirical multiplexing patterns in Indian village data. We show that relationships such as socializing, advising, helping, and lending are correlated but distinct, while commonly used proxies for networks based on ethnicity and geography are nearly uncorrelated with actual relationships. We also show that these layers and their overlap affect information diffusion in a field experiment. The advice network is the best predictor of diffusion, but combining layers improves predictions further. Villages with greater overlap between layers -- more multiplexing -- experience less overall diffusion. Finally, we identify differences in multiplexing by gender and connectedness. These have implications for inequality in diffusion-mediated outcomes such as access to information and adherence to norms.</description>

      <title>Stronger together? The homophily trap in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While homophily -- the tendency to link with similar others -- may nurture a sense of belonging and shared values, it can also hinder diversity and widen inequalities. Here, we unravel this trade-off analytically, revealing homophily traps for minority groups: scenarios where increased homophilic interaction among minorities negatively affects their structural opportunities within a network. We demonstrate that homophily traps arise when minority size falls below 25% of a network, at which point homophily comes at the expense of lower structural visibility for the minority group. Our work reveals that social groups require a critical size to benefit from homophily without incurring structural costs, providing insights into core processes underlying the emergence of group inequality in networks.</description>

      <title>PhysGym: Benchmarking LLMs in Interactive Physics Discovery with Controlled Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{PhysGym}, a novel benchmark suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific reasoning in interactive physics environments. \textsc{PhysGym}'s primary contribution lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. \textsc{PhysGym} provides standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.</description>

      <title>Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from European football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Penalty shootouts play an important role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments, especially since the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule in its club competitions. Inspired by this rule change, our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, or psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, stronger teams, defined first by Elo ratings, do not perform better than their weaker opponents. Consequently, penalty shootouts are equivalent to a perfect lottery in top European football.</description>

      <title>The Marked Edge Walk: A Novel MCMC Algorithm for Sampling of Graph Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have enabled the generation of large ensembles of redistricting plans through graph partitioning. However, existing algorithms such as Reversible Recombination (RevReCom) and Metropolized Forest Recombination (MFR) are constrained to sampling from distributions related to spanning trees. We introduce the marked edge walk (MEW), a novel MCMC algorithm for sampling from the space of graph partitions under a tunable distribution. The walk operates on the space of spanning trees with marked edges, allowing for calculable transition probabilities for use in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Empirical results on real-world dual graphs show convergence under target distributions unrelated to spanning trees. For this reason, MEW represents an advancement in flexible ensemble generation.</description>
