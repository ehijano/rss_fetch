      <title>Exploring Visual Complaints through a test battery in Acquired Brain Injury Patients: A Detailed Analysis of the DiaNAH Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated visual impairment complaints in a sample of 948 Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) patients using the DiaNAH dataset, emphasizing advanced machine learning techniques for managing missing data. Patients completed a CVS questionnaire capturing eight types of visual symptoms, including blurred vision and altered contrast perception. Due to incomplete data, 181 patients were excluded, resulting in an analytical subset of 767 individuals. To address the challenge of missing data, an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach was employed for data imputation, preserving the distributional characteristics of the original dataset. Patients were grouped according to singular and combined complaint clusters derived from the 40,320 potential combinations identified through the CVS questionnaire. A linear correlation analysis revealed minimal to no direct relationship between patient-reported visual complaints and standard visual perceptual function tests. This study represents an initial systematic attempt to understand the complex relationship between subjective visual complaints and objective visual perceptual assessments in ABI patients. Given the limitations of sample size and variability, further studies with larger populations are recommended to robustly explore these complaint clusters and their implications for visual perception following brain injury.</description>

      <title>Quantum information theoretic approach to the hard problem of consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional theories of consciousness, based on emergence of conscious experiences from the execution of a particular function by an insentient brain, face the hard problem of consciousness of explaining why the insentient brain should produce any conscious experiences at all. This problem is exacerbated by the determinism characterizing the laws of classical physics, due to the resulting lack of causal potency of the emergent consciousness, which is not present already as a physical quantity in the deterministic equations of motion of the brain. Here, we present a quantum information theoretic approach to the hard problem of consciousness that avoids all of the drawbacks of emergence. This is achieved through reductive identification of first-person subjective conscious states with unobservable quantum state vectors in the brain, whereas the anatomically observable brain is viewed as a third-person objective construct created by classical bits of information obtained during the measurement of a subset of commuting quantum brain observables by the environment. Quantum resource theory further implies that the quantum features of consciousness granted by quantum no-go theorems cannot be replicated by any classical physical device.</description>

      <title>Uncovering potential effects of spontaneous waves on synaptic development: the visual system as a model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous waves are ubiquitous during early brain development and are hypothesized to drive the development of receptive fields (RFs). Different stages of spontaneous waves in the retina have been observed to coincide with the development of the retinotopic map, ON-OFF segregation, and orientation selectivity in the early visual pathway of mammals, and can be characterized by different activity patterns in the retina and downstream areas. Stage II waves, which occur in rodents right after birth, have been implicated in a possible synaptic pruning process, relating these stage II retinal waves to the refinement of the retinotopic map. However, the mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent effects of retinal waves on primary visual cortex (V1) are poorly understood. In this work, we build a biologically-constrained model of the development of thalamocortical synapses onto neurons in V1 driven by stage II retinal waves using a spike-timing dependent triplet learning rule. Using this model, together with a reduced rate-based model, we propose possible mechanisms underlying such a pruning process and predict how characteristics of the retinal waves may lead to different RF structures, including periodic RFs. We introduce gap junctions into the V1 network and show that such a coupling can serve to promote precise local retinotopy. Finally, we discuss how the spatial distribution of synaptic weights at the end of stage II may affect the emergence of orientation selectivity of V1 neurons during stage III waves. The mechanisms uncovered in this work may be useful in understanding synaptic structures that emerge across cortical regions during development.</description>

      <title>Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.</description>

      <title>Subtle variations in stiff dimensions of brain networks account for individual differences in cognitive ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining individual differences in cognitive abilities requires both identifying brain parameters that vary across individuals and understanding how brain networks are recruited for specific tasks. Typically, task performance relies on the integration and segregation of functional subnetworks, often captured by parameters like regional excitability and connectivity. Yet, the high dimensionality of these parameters hinders pinpointing their functional relevance. Here, we apply stiff-sloppy analysis to human brain data, revealing that certain subtle parameter combinations ("stiff dimensions") powerfully influence neural activity during task processing, whereas others ("sloppy dimensions") vary more extensively but exert minimal impact. Using a pairwise maximum entropy model of task fMRI, we show that even small deviations in stiff dimensions-derived through Fisher Information Matrix analysis-govern the dynamic interplay of segregation and integration between the default mode network (DMN) and a working memory network (WMN). Crucially, separating a 0-back task (vigilant attention) from a 2-back task (working memory updating) uncovers partially distinct stiff dimensions predicting performance in each condition, along with a global DMN-WMN segregation shared across both tasks. Altogether, stiff-sloppy analysis challenges the conventional focus on large parameter variability by highlighting these subtle yet functionally decisive parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Structuring the Environment Nudges Participants Toward Hierarchical Over Shortest Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective planning is crucial for navigating complex environments and achieving goals efficiently. In this study, we investigated how environmental structure influences the selection of planning strategies. Forty-two participants navigated a space station to collect colored spheres, with environments either structured (spheres grouped by color) or unstructured (spheres scattered randomly). We tested three types of plans: hierarchical (grouping spheres by color), shortest path (minimizing travel distance), and neutral (none of the above). By manipulating environmental structure, we were able to nudge participants toward a preference for hierarchical planning in structured environments, while shortest path plans were favored in unstructured environments. A mismatch between self-reported preferences and actual choices indicated that participants often adopted implicit strategies, unaware of their decision-making processes. These findings highlight the powerful effect of environmental cues on planning and suggest that even subtle changes in structure can guide the selection of planning strategies.</description>

      <title>Better artificial intelligence does not mean better models of biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate perception and neural responses as they improved on vision benchmarks, raising hopes that advances in AI would yield better models of biological vision. However, we show across three benchmarks that this alignment is now plateauing - and in some cases worsening - as DNNs scale to human or superhuman accuracy. This divergence may reflect the adoption of visual strategies that differ from those used by primates. These findings challenge the view that progress in artificial intelligence will naturally translate to neuroscience. We argue that vision science must chart its own course, developing algorithms grounded in biological visual systems rather than optimizing for benchmarks based on internet-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>The dynamic interplay between in-context and in-weight learning in humans and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of "in-context learning" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.</description>

      <title>Evaluating tDCS Intervention Effectiveness via Functional Connectivity Network on Resting-State EEG Data in Major Depressive Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet its effects on neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the impact of tDCS in individuals with MDD using resting-state EEG data and network neuroscience to analyze functional connectivity. We examined power spectral density (PSD) changes and functional connectivity (FC) patterns across theta, alpha, and beta bands before and after tDCS intervention. A notable aspect of this research involves the modification of the binarizing threshold algorithm to assess functional connectivity networks, facilitating a meaningful comparison at the group level. Our analysis using optimal threshold binarization techniques revealed significant modifications in network topology, particularly evident in the beta band, indicative of reduced randomization or enhanced small-worldness after tDCS. Furthermore, the hubness analysis identified specific brain regions, notably the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions across all frequency bands, exhibiting increased functional connectivity, suggesting their involvement in the antidepressant effects of tDCS. Notably, tDCS intervention transformed the dispersed high connectivity into localized connectivity and increased left-sided asymmetry across all frequency bands. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of tDCS on neural mechanisms in MDD, offering a potential direction for further research and therapeutic development in the field of neuromodulation for mental health disorders.</description>

      <title>ST-FlowNet: An Efficient Spiking Neural Network for Event-Based Optical Flow Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising tool for event-based optical flow estimation tasks due to their ability to leverage spatio-temporal information and low-power capabilities. However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark event-based datasets demonstrate that the SNN-based ST-FlowNet model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance in accurate optical flow estimation across a diverse range of dynamic visual scenes. Furthermore, the inherent energy efficiency of SNN models is highlighted, establishing a compelling advantage for their practical deployment. Overall, our work presents a novel framework for optical flow estimation using SNNs and event-based data, contributing to the advancement of neuromorphic vision applications.</description>
