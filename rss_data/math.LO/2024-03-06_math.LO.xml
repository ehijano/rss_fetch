      <title>Torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank and fields of finite transcendence degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\operatorname{TFAb}_r$ be the class of torsion-free abelian groups of rank $r$, and let $\operatorname{FD}_r$ be the class of fields of characteristic $0$ and transcendence degree~$r$. We compare these classes using various notions. Considering Scott complexity of the structures in the classes and the complexity of the isomorphism relations on the classes, the classes seem very similar. Hjorth and Thomas showed that the $\operatorname{TFAb}_r$ are strictly increasing under Borel reducibility. This is not so for the classes $\operatorname{FD}_r$. Thomas and Velickovic showed that for sufficiently large $r$, the classes $\operatorname{FD}_r$ are equivalent under Borel reducibility. We try to compare the groups with the fields, using Borel reducibility, and also using some effective variants. We give functorial Turing computable embeddings of $\operatorname{TFAb}_r$ in $\operatorname{FD}_r$, and of $\operatorname{FD}_r$ in $\operatorname{FD}_{r+1}$. We show that under computable countable reducibility, $\operatorname{TFAb}_1$ lies on top among the classes we are considering. In fact, under computable countable reducibility, isomorphism on $\operatorname{TFAb}_1$ lies on top among equivalence relations that are effective $\Sigma_3$, along with the Vitali equivalence relation on $2^\omega$.</description>

      <title>Two results on complexities of decision problems of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer two questions on the complexities of decision problems of groups, each related to a classical result. First, C. Miller characterized the complexity of the isomorphism problem for finitely presented groups in 1971. We do the same for the isomorphism problem for recursively presented groups. Second, the fact that every Turing degree appears as the degree of the word problem of a finitely presented group is shown independently by multiple people in the 1960s. We answer the analogous question for degrees of ceers instead of Turing degrees. We show that the set of ceers which are computably equivalent to a finitely presented group is $\Sigma^0_3$-complete, which is the maximal possible complexity.</description>

      <title>Obligations and permissions, algebraically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further develop the algebraic approach to input/output logic initiated in \cite{wollic22}, where subordination algebras and a family of their generalizations were proposed as a semantic environment of various input/output logics.In particular, we consider precontact algebras as a suitable algebraic environment for negative permission, and we characterize properties of several types of permission (negative, static, dynamic), as well as their interactions with normative systems, by means of suitable modal languages encoding outputs.</description>

      <title>A 2-categorical analysis of context comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the equivalence between the two main categorical models for the type-theoretical operation of context comprehension, namely P. Dybjer's categories with families and B. Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.</description>

      <title>A remark on $\mathscr{C}^\infty$ definable equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that if a submanifold $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is definable in some o-minimal structure then any definable submanifold $N\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ which is $\mathscr{C}^\infty$ diffeomorphic to $M$, with a diffeomorphism $h:N\to M$ that is sufficiently close to the identity, must be $\mathscr{C}^\infty$ definably diffeomorphic to $M$. The definable diffeomorphism between $N$ and $M$ is then provided by a tubular neighborhood of $M$.</description>

      <title>Elementary Properties of Free Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start a systematic analysis of the first-order model theory of free lattices. We prove several results. Firstly, we prove that the free lattices of finite rank are not positively indistinguishable, as there is a positive $\exists \forall$-sentence true in $\mathbf F_3$ and false in $\mathbf F_4$. Secondly, we show that every model of $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbf F_n)$ admits a canonical homomorphism into the profinite completion $\mathbf H_n$ of $\mathbf F_n$. Thirdly, we show that $\mathbf H_n$ is isomorphic to the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of $\mathbf F_n$, and that $\mathbf H_n$ is not positively elementary equivalent to $\mathbf F_n$, as there is a positive $\forall\exists$-sentence true in $\mathbf H_n$ and false in $\mathbf F_n$. Finally, we show that $\mathrm{DM}(\mathbf F_n)$ is a retract of $\mathrm{Id}(\mathbf F_n)$, and that for any lattice $\mathbf K$ which satisfies Whitman's condition $(W)$ and which is generated by join prime elements the lattices $\mathbf K$, $\mathrm{DM}(\mathbf K)$ and $\mathrm{Id}(\mathbf K)$ all share the same positive universal theory.</description>

      <title>Computable Scott sentences and the weak Whitehead problem for finitely presented groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $A$ is a computable Hopfian finitely presented structure, then $A$ has a computable $d$-$\Sigma_2$ Scott sentence if and only if the weak Whitehead problem for $A$ is decidable. We use this to infer that every hyperbolic group as well as any polycyclic-by-finite group has a computable $d$-$\Sigma_2$ Scott sentence, thus covering two main classes of finitely presented groups. Our proof also implies that every weakly Hopfian finitely presented group is strongly defined by its $\exists^+$-types, a question which arose in a different context.</description>

      <title>Decidability for Sturmian words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the first-order theory of Sturmian words over Presburger arithmetic is decidable. Using a general adder recognizing addition in Ostrowski numeration systems by Baranwal, Schaeffer and Shallit, we prove that the first-order expansions of Presburger arithmetic by a single Sturmian word are uniformly $\omega$-automatic, and then deduce the decidability of the theory of the class of such structures. Using an implementation of this decision algorithm called Pecan, we automatically reprove classical theorems about Sturmian words in seconds, and are able to obtain new results about antisquares and antipalindromes in characteristic Sturmian words.</description>

      <title>Regular bi-interpretability and finite axiomatizability of Chevalley groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Chevalley groups over commutative rings with $1$, constructed by irreducible root systems of rank $&gt;1$. We always suppose that for the systems $A_2, B_\ell, C_\ell, F_4, G_2$ our rings contain $1/2$ and for the system $G_2$ also $1/3$. Under these assumptions we prove that the central quotients of Chevalley groups are regularly bi-interpretable with the corresponding rings, the class of all central quotients of Chevalley groups of a given type is elementarily definable and even finitely axiomatizable. The same holds for adjoint Chevalley groups and for other Chevalley groups with some special condition of bounded generation. We also give an example of Chevalley group with infinite center, which is not bi-interpretable with the corresponding ring and is elementarily equivalent to a group that is not a Chevalley group itself.</description>
