      <title>Musical Agent Systems: MACAT and MACataRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research explores the development and application of musical agents, human-in-the-loop generative AI systems designed to support music performance and improvisation within co-creative spaces. We introduce MACAT and MACataRT, two distinct musical agent systems crafted to enhance interactive music-making between human musicians and AI. MACAT is optimized for agent-led performance, employing real-time synthesis and self-listening to shape its output autonomously, while MACataRT provides a flexible environment for collaborative improvisation through audio mosaicing and sequence-based learning. Both systems emphasize training on personalized, small datasets, fostering ethical and transparent AI engagement that respects artistic integrity. This research highlights how interactive, artist-centred generative AI can expand creative possibilities, empowering musicians to explore new forms of artistic expression in real-time, performance-driven and music improvisation contexts.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Limited Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem setting in which multiple autonomous agents must cooperatively navigate and perform tasks in an unknown, communication-constrained environment. Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches assume synchronous communications and perform poorly in such environments. We propose AsynCoMARL, an asynchronous MARL approach that uses graph transformers to learn communication protocols from dynamic graphs. AsynCoMARL can accommodate infrequent and asynchronous communications between agents, with edges of the graph only forming when agents communicate with each other. We show that AsynCoMARL achieves similar success and collision rates as leading baselines, despite 26\% fewer messages being passed between agents.</description>

      <title>JustAct+: Justified and Accountable Actions in Policy-Regulated, Multi-Domain Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-organisational data exchange is regulated by norms originating from sources ranging from (inter)national laws, to processing agreements, and individual consent. Verifying norm compliance is complex because laws (e.g., GDPR) distribute responsibility and require accountability. Moreover, in some application domains (e.g., healthcare), privacy requirements extend the norms (e.g., patient consent). In contrast, existing solutions such as smart contracts, access- and usage-control assume policies to be public, or otherwise, statically partition policy information at the cost of accountability and flexibility. Instead, our framework prescribes how decentralised agents justify their actions with policy fragments that the agents autonomously create, gossip, and assemble. Crucially, the permission of actions is always reproducible by any observer, even with a partial view of all the dynamic policies. Actors can be sure that future auditors will confirm their permissions. Systems centralise control by (re)configuring externally synchronised agreements, the bases of all justifications. As a result, control is centralised only to the extent desired by the agents.
  In this paper, we define the JustAct framework, detail its implementation in a particular data-processing system, and design a suitable policy language based on logic programming. A case study reproduces Brane - an existing policy-regulated, inter-domain, medical data processing system - and serves to demonstrate and assess the qualities of the framework.</description>

      <title>Distributive Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Alignment with Human Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) for decision-making in social and economic contexts has raised questions about their potential to function as agents in these domains. A significant number of societal problems involve the distribution of resources, where fairness, along with economic efficiency, play a critical role in the desirability of outcomes. In this paper, we examine whether LLM responses adhere to fundamental fairness concepts such as equitability, envy-freeness, and Rawlsian maximin, and investigate their alignment with human preferences. We evaluate the performance of several LLMs, providing a comparative benchmark of their ability to reflect these measures. Our results demonstrate a lack of alignment between current LLM responses and human distributional preferences. Moreover, LLMs are unable to utilize money as a transferable resource to mitigate inequality. Nonetheless, we demonstrate a stark contrast when (some) LLMs are tasked with selecting from a predefined menu of options rather than generating one. In addition, we analyze the robustness of LLM responses to variations in semantic factors (e.g. intentions or personas) or non-semantic prompting changes (e.g. templates or orderings). Finally, we highlight potential strategies aimed at enhancing the alignment of LLM behavior with well-established fairness concepts.</description>

      <title>The Composite Task Challenge for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant role of division of labor (DOL) in promoting cooperation is widely recognized in real-world applications.Many cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have incorporated the concept of DOL to improve cooperation among agents.However, the tasks used in existing testbeds typically correspond to tasks where DOL is often not a necessary feature for achieving optimal policies.Additionally, the full utilize of DOL concept in MARL methods remains unrealized due to the absence of appropriate tasks.To enhance the generality and applicability of MARL methods in real-world scenarios, there is a necessary to develop tasks that demand multi-agent DOL and cooperation.In this paper, we propose a series of tasks designed to meet these requirements, drawing on real-world rules as the guidance for their design.We guarantee that DOL and cooperation are necessary condition for completing tasks and introduce three factors to expand the diversity of proposed tasks to cover more realistic situations.We evaluate 10 cooperative MARL methods on the proposed tasks.The results indicate that all baselines perform poorly on these tasks.To further validate the solvability of these tasks, we also propose simplified variants of proposed tasks.Experimental results show that baselines are able to handle these simplified variants, providing evidence of the solvability of the proposed tasks.The source files is available at https://github.com/Yurui-Li/CTC.</description>

      <title>A Differentiated Reward Method for Reinforcement Learning based Multi-Vehicle Cooperative Decision-Making Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great potential for optimizing multi-vehicle cooperative driving strategies through the state-action-reward feedback loop, but it still faces challenges such as low sample efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>MarketSenseAI 2.0: Enhancing Stock Analysis through LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&amp;P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&amp;P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Agency in the Age of AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is significant concern about the impact of generative AI on society. Modern AI tools are capable of generating ever more realistic text, images, and videos, and functional code, from minimal prompts. Accompanying this rise in ability and usability, there is increasing alarm about the misuses to which these tools can be put, and the intentional and unintentional harms to individuals and society that may result. In this paper, we argue that \emph{agency} is the appropriate lens to study these harms and benefits, but that doing so will require advancement in the theory of agency, and advancement in how this theory is applied in (agent-based) models.</description>

      <title>FedHPD: Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning via Policy Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) improves sample efficiency while preserving privacy; however, most existing studies assume homogeneous agents, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates FedRL in black-box settings with heterogeneous agents, where each agent employs distinct policy networks and training configurations without disclosing their internal details. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising method for facilitating knowledge sharing among heterogeneous models, but it faces challenges related to the scarcity of public datasets and limitations in knowledge representation when applied to FedRL. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Heterogeneous Policy Distillation (FedHPD), which solves the problem of heterogeneous FedRL by utilizing action probability distributions as a medium for knowledge sharing. We provide a theoretical analysis of FedHPD's convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments corroborate that FedHPD shows significant improvements across various reinforcement learning benchmark tasks, further validating our theoretical findings. Moreover, additional experiments demonstrate that FedHPD operates effectively without the need for an elaborate selection of public datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot connective collaboration toward collective obstacle field traversal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environments with large terrain height variations present great challenges for legged robot locomotion. Drawing inspiration from fire ants' collective assembly behavior, we study strategies that can enable two ``connectable'' robots to collectively navigate over bumpy terrains with height variations larger than robot leg length. Each robot was designed to be extremely simple, with a cubical body and one rotary motor actuating four vertical peg legs that move in pairs. Two or more robots could physically connect to one another to enhance collective mobility. We performed locomotion experiments with a two-robot group, across an obstacle field filled with uniformly-distributed semi-spherical ``boulders''. Experimentally-measured robot speed suggested that the connection length between the robots has a significant effect on collective mobility: connection length C in [0.86, 0.9] robot unit body length (UBL) were able to produce sustainable movements across the obstacle field, whereas connection length C in [0.63, 0.84] and [0.92, 1.1] UBL resulted in low traversability. An energy landscape based model revealed the underlying mechanism of how connection length modulated collective mobility through the system's potential energy landscape, and informed adaptation strategies for the two-robot system to adapt their connection length for traversing obstacle fields with varying spatial frequencies. Our results demonstrated that by varying the connection configuration between the robots, the two-robot system could leverage mechanical intelligence to better utilize obstacle interaction forces and produce improved locomotion. Going forward, we envision that generalized principles of robot-environment coupling can inform design and control strategies for a large group of small robots to achieve ant-like collective environment negotiation.</description>

      <title>GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy. The code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTeam.</description>

      <title>On the Tractability Landscape of the Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work examines the Conditional Approval Framework for elections involving multiple interdependent issues, specifically focusing on the Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of this rule, demonstrating that no approach can significantly outperform the brute-force algorithm under common computational complexity assumptions and various natural input restrictions. In response, we propose two practical restrictions (the first in the literature) that make the problem computationally tractable and show that these restrictions are essentially tight. Overall, this work provides a clear picture of the tractability landscape of the problem, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the complications introduced by conditional ballots and indicating that conditional approval voting can be applied in practice, albeit under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Conversational Bias in AI Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to reduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical settings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying biases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their contextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent systems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this gap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent systems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves simulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned perspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to expectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the generated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents initially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented political bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias observed in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current state-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires. This highlights a critical need for the development of a more sophisticated toolkit for bias detection and mitigation for AI multi-agent systems. The code to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLMsConversationalBias-7725.</description>
