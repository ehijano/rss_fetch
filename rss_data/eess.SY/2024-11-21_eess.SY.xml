      <title>DIETS: Diabetic Insulin Management System in Everyday Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People with diabetes need insulin delivery to effectively manage their blood glucose levels, especially after meals, because their bodies either do not produce enough insulin or cannot fully utilize it. Accurate insulin delivery starts with estimating the nutrients in meals and is followed by developing a detailed, personalized insulin injection strategy. These tasks are particularly challenging in daily life, especially without professional guidance. Existing solutions usually assume the prior knowledge of nutrients in meals and primarily rely on feedback from professional clinicians or simulators to develop Reinforcement Learning-based models for insulin management, leading to extensive consumption of medical resources and difficulties in adapting the models to new patients due to individual differences. In this paper, we propose DIETS, a novel diabetic insulin management framework built on the transformer architecture, to help people with diabetes effectively manage insulin delivery in everyday life. Specifically, DIETS tailors a Large Language Model (LLM) to estimate the nutrients in meals and employs a titration model to generate recommended insulin injection strategies, which are further validated by a glucose prediction model to prevent potential risks of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. DIETS has been extensively evaluated on three public datasets, and the results show it achieves superior performance in providing effective insulin delivery recommendation to control blood glucose levels.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer for Millimetric Magnetoelectric Biomedical Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniature bioelectronic implants promise revolutionary therapies for cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a significant method for miniaturization, eliminating the need for bulky batteries in devices. Despite successful demonstrations of millimetric battery free implants in animal models, the robustness and efficiency of WPT are known to degrade significantly under misalignment incurred by body movements, respiration, heart beating, and limited control of implant orientation during surgery. This article presents an omnidirectional WPT platform for millimetric bioelectronic implants, employing the emerging magnetoelectric (ME) WPT modality, and magnetic field steering technique based on multiple transmitter (TX) coils. To accurately sense the weak coupling in a miniature implant and adaptively control the multicoil TX array in a closed loop, we develop an active echo (AE) scheme using a tiny coil on the implant. Our prototype comprises a fully integrated 14.2 mm3 implantable stimulator embedding a custom low power system on chip (SoC) powered by an ME film, a TX with a custom three channel AE RX chip, and a multicoil TX array with mutual inductance cancellation. The AE RX achieves negative 161 dBm per Hz input referred noise with 64 dB gain tuning range to reliably sense the AE signal, and offers fast polarity detection for driver control. AE simultaneously enhances the robustness, efficiency, and charging range of ME WPT. Under 90 degree rotation from the ideal position, our omnidirectional WPT system achieves 6.8x higher power transfer efficiency (PTE) than a single coil baseline. The tracking error of AE negligibly degrades the PTE by less than 2 percent from using ideal control.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control Barrier Functions with Vanishing Conservativeness Under Persistency of Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a closed-form adaptive controlbarrier-function (CBF) approach for satisfying state constraints in systems with parametric uncertainty. This approach uses a sampled-data recursive-least-squares algorithm to estimate the unknown model parameters and construct a nonincreasing upper bound on the norm of the estimation error. Together, this estimate and upper bound are used to construct a CBF-based constraint that has nonincreasing conservativeness. Furthermore, if a persistency of excitation condition is satisfied, then the CBFbased constraint has vanishing conservativeness in the sense that the CBF-based constraint converges to the ideal constraint corresponding to the case where the uncertainty is known. In addition, the approach incorporates a monotonically improving estimate of the unknown model parameters thus, this estimate can be effectively incorporated into a desired control law. We demonstrate constraint satisfaction and performance using 2 two numerical examples, namely, a nonlinear pendulum and a nonholonomic robot.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Underwater Acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with In-Phase and Quadrature Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an underwater acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (UA-RIS) designed for long-range, high-speed, and environmentally friendly communication in oceanic environments. The proposed UA-RIS comprises multiple pairs of acoustic reflectors that utilize in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulation to flexibly control the amplitude and phase of reflected waves. This capability enables precise beam steering to enhance or attenuate sound levels in specific directions. A prototype UA-RIS with 4*6 acoustic reflection units is constructed and tested in both tank and lake environments to evaluate performance. The experimental results indicate that the prototype is capable of effectively pointing reflected waves to targeted directions while minimizing side lobes using passive IQ modulation. Field tests reveal that deploying the UA-RIS on the sender side considerably extends communication ranges by 28% in deep water and 46% in shallow waters. Furthermore, with a fixed communication distance, positioning the UA-RIS at the transmitter side substantially boosts data rates, with an average increase of 63.8% and peaks up to 96%. When positioned on the receiver side, the UA-RIS can expand the communication range in shallow and deep water environments by 40.6% and 66%, respectively. Moreover, placing the UA-RIS close to the receiver enhances data rates by an average of 80.3%, reaching up to 163% under certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>Improving Low-Fidelity Models of Li-ion Batteries via Hybrid Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of lithium ion (li-ion) batteries is essential for enhancing the safety, and efficiency of electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. This paper presents a data-inspired approach for improving the fidelity of reduced-order li-ion battery models. The proposed method combines a Genetic Algorithm with Sequentially Thresholded Ridge Regression (GA-STRidge) to identify and compensate for discrepancies between a low-fidelity model (LFM) and data generated either from testing or a high-fidelity model (HFM). The hybrid model, combining physics-based and data-driven methods, is tested across different driving cycles to demonstrate the ability to significantly reduce the voltage prediction error compared to the baseline LFM, while preserving computational efficiency. The model robustness is also evaluated under various operating conditions, showing low prediction errors and high Pearson correlation coefficients for terminal voltage in unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Switched Affine Systems With Dwell-Time Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of stabilization of switched affine systems under dwell-time constraint, giving guarantees on the bound of the quadratic cost associated with the proposed state switching control law. Specifically, two switching rules are presented relying on the solution of differential Lyapunov inequalities and Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities, from which the stability conditions are expressed. The first one allows to regulate the state of linear switched systems to zero, whereas the second one is designed for switched affine systems proving practical stability of the origin. In both cases, the determination of a guaranteed cost associated with each control strategy is shown. In the cases of linear and affine systems, the existence of the solution for the Lyapunov-Metzler condition is discussed and guidelines for the selection of a solution ensuring suitable performance of the system evolution are provided. The theoretical results are finally assessed by means of three examples.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Scheduling of QSR-Dissipative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers gain-scheduling of QSR-dissipative subsystems using scheduling matrices. The corresponding QSR-dissipative properties of the overall matrix-gain-scheduled system, which depends on the QSR properties of the subsystems scheduled, are explicitly derived. The use of scheduling matrices is a generalization of the scalar scheduling signals used in the literature, and allows for greater design freedom when scheduling systems, such as in the case of gain-scheduled control. Furthermore, this work extends the existing gain-scheduling results to a broader class of QSR-dissipative systems. The matrix-scheduling of important special cases, such as passive, input strictly passive, output strictly passive, finite L2 gain, very strictly passive, and conic systems are presented. The proposed gain-scheduling architecture is used in the context of controlling a planar three-link robot subject to model uncertainty. A novel control synthesis technique is used to design QSR-dissipative subcontrollers that are gain-scheduled using scheduling matrices. Numerical simulation results highlight the greater design freedom of scheduling matrices, leading to improved performance.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating Forecasting with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) is a promising solution to increase the utilization of transmission lines by adjusting ratings based on real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecast at the scheduling stage is thus necessary for system operators to proactively optimize power flows, manage congestion, and reduce the cost of grid operations. However, the DLR forecast remains challenging due to weather uncertainty. To reliably predict DLRs, we propose a new probabilistic forecasting model based on line graph convolutional LSTM. Like standard LSTM networks, our model accounts for temporal correlations between DLRs across the planning horizon. The line graph-structured network additionally allows us to leverage the spatial correlations of DLR features across the grid to improve the quality of predictions. Simulation results on the synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline probabilistic DLR forecasting models regarding reliability and sharpness while using the fewest parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the assumption that a finite signal with different sampling lengths or different sampling frequencies is considered as equivalent, the signal space is considered as the quotient space of $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ over equivalence. The topological structure and the properties of signal space are investigated. Using them some characteristics of semi-tensor product based compressed sensing (STP-CS) are revealed. Finally, a systematic analysis of the construction of sensing matrix based on balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is presented.</description>

      <title>Robust Convergency Indicator using High-dimension PID Controller in the presence of disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PID controller currently occupies a prominent position as the most prevalent control architecture, which has achieved groundbreaking success across extensive implications. However, its parameters online regulation remains a formidable challenge. The majority of existing theories hinge on the linear constant system structure, contemplating only Single-Input, Single-Output (SISO) scenarios. Restricted research has been conducted on the intricate PID control problem within high-dimensional, Multi-Input, Multi-Output (MIMO) nonlinear systems that incorporate disturbances. This research, providing insights on the velocity form of nonlinear system, aims to bolster the controller's robustness. It establishes a quantitative metric to assess the robustness of high-dimensional PID controller, elucidates the pivotal theory regarding robustness's impact on error exponential convergence, and introduces a localized compensation strategy to optimize the robustness indicator. Guided by these theoretical insights, we exploit a robust high-dimensional PID (RH-PID) controller without the crutch of oversimplifying assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate the controller's commendable exponential stabilization efficacy and the controller exhibits exceptional robustness under the robust indicator's guidance. Notably, the robust convergence indicator can also effectively evaluate the comprehensive performance.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Fairness -- A Framework For The Design Of Equitable Cybernetic Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in computer science, artificial intelligence, and control systems of the recent have catalyzed the emergence of cybernetic societies, where algorithms play a significant role in decision-making processes affecting the daily life of humans in almost every aspect. Algorithmic decision-making expands into almost every industry, government processes critical infrastructure, and shapes the life-reality of people and the very fabric of social interactions and communication. Besides the great potentials to improve efficiency and reduce corruption, missspecified cybernetic systems harbor the threat to create societal inequities, systematic discrimination, and dystopic, totalitarian societies. Fairness is a crucial component in the design of cybernetic systems, to promote cooperation between selfish individuals, to achieve better outcomes at the system level, to confront public resistance, to gain trust and acceptance for rules and institutions, to perforate self-reinforcing cycles of poverty through social mobility, to incentivize motivation, contribution and satisfaction of people through inclusion, to increase social-cohesion in groups, and ultimately to improve life quality. Quantitative descriptions of fairness are crucial to reflect equity into algorithms, but only few works in the fairness literature offer such measures; the existing quantitative measures in the literature are either too application-specific, suffer from undesirable characteristics, or are not ideology-agnostic. Therefore, this work proposes a quantitative, transactional, distributive fairness framework, which enables systematic design of socially feasible decision-making systems. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of fairness and transparency when designing algorithms for equitable, cybernetic societies.</description>

      <title>Identification of Black-Box Inverter-Based Resource Control Using Hammerstein-Wiener Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of more complex inverter-based resources (IBRs) control is becoming essential as a result of the growing share of renewable energy sources in power systems. Given the diverse range of control schemes, grid operators are typically provided with black-box models of IBRs from various equipment manufacturers. As such, they are integrated into simulation models of the entire power system for analysis, and due to their nature, they can only be simulated in the time domain. Other system analysis approaches, like eigenvalue analysis, cannot be applied, making the comprehensive analysis of defined systems more challenging. This work introduces an approach for identification of three-phase IBR models for grid-forming and grid-following inverters using Hammerstein-Wiener models. To this end, we define a simulation framework for the identification process, and select suitable evaluation metrics for the results. Finally, we evaluate the approach on generic grid-forming and grid-following inverter models showing good identification results.</description>

      <title>Unified Performance Control for Non-Square Nonlinear Systems with Relaxed Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of unified prescribed performance tracking for a class of non-square strict-feedback nonlinear systems in the presence of actuator faults under relaxed controllability conditions. By using a skillful matrix decomposition and introducing some feasible auxiliary matrices, a more generalized controllability condition than the current state of the art is constructed, which can be applied to both square and non-square nonlinear systems subject to actuator faults and unknown yet time-varying control gain. Incorporating the relaxed controllability conditions and the uniform performance specifications into the backstepping design procedure, a prescribed performance fault-tolerant controller is developed that can achieve different performance demands without modifying the controller structure, which is more flexible and practical. In addition, the destruction of the system stability by unknown auxiliary matrices and unknown nonlinearities is circumvented by embedding the available core information of the state-dependent uncertainties into the design procedure. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Analytic Design of Flat-Wire Inductors for High-Current and Compact DC-DC Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents analytic study and design considerations of flat wire inductors with distributed gaps for high-power and compact DC-DC Converters. The focus is eddy current loss components within the conductors due to fringing and leakage fluxes. A magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is proposed in which eddy currents are modeled by MMFs opposing the primary flux as well as frequency dependent reluctances, which finally leads to a frequency dependent inductance describing the behavior of the inductor at high frequencies. Three formulations for DC resistance depending on the required accuracy are developed. Calculations of the AC resistance based on vector potential obtained from FEM are provided. To provide an insight into the optimized design of such inductors, components of the magnetic flux and induced eddy currents along with sensitivity of the main inductor quantities such as DCR, ESR, loss components and inductance values to the design parameters are investigated. Finally, an inductor is prototyped and experimentally tested to verify the design.</description>

We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee robust stability in ego-state estimates and bounded errors in landmark position estimates, even under limited landmark visibility which directly affects overall system detectability. This is achieved by decoupling the MHE updates for the ego-state and landmark positions, enabling individual landmark updates only when the required detectability conditions are met. The decoupled MHE structure also allows for parallelization of landmark updates, improving computational efficiency. We discuss the key assumptions, including ego-state detectability and Lipschitz continuity of the landmark measurement model, with respect to typical SLAM sensor configurations, and introduce a streamlined method for the range measurement model. Simulation results validate the considered method, highlighting its efficacy and robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>Abstracted Model Reduction: A General Framework for Efficient Interconnected System Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of abstracted model reduction: a framework to improve the tractability of structure-preserving methods for the complexity reduction of interconnected system models. To effectively reduce high-order, interconnected models, it is usually not sufficient to consider the subsystems separately. Instead, structure-preserving reduction methods should be employed, which consider the interconnected dynamics to select which subsystem dynamics to retain in reduction. However, structure-preserving methods are often not computationally tractable. To overcome this issue, we propose to connect each subsystem model to a low-order abstraction of its environment to reduce it both effectively and efficiently. By means of a high-fidelity structural-dynamics model from the lithography industry, we show, on the one hand, significantly increased accuracy with respect to standard subsystem reduction and, on the other hand, similar accuracy to direct application of expensive structure-preserving methods, while significantly reducing computational cost. Furthermore, we formulate a systematic approach to automatically determine sufficient abstraction and reduction orders to preserve stability and guarantee a given frequency-dependent error specification. We apply this approach to the lithography equipment use case and show that the environment model can indeed be reduced by over 80\% without significant loss in the accuracy of the reduced interconnected model.</description>

      <title>IoT-Based Coma Patient Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of coma patients is essential but challenging, especially in developing countries with limited resources, staff, and infrastructure. This paper presents a low-cost IoT-based system designed for such environments. It uses affordable hardware and robust software to monitor patients without constant internet access or extensive medical personnel. The system employs cost-effective sensors to track vital signs, including heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, eye movement, and body position. An energy-efficient microcontroller processes data locally, synchronizing with a central server when network access is available. A locally hosted app provides on-site access to patient data, while a GSM module sends immediate alerts for critical events, even in areas with limited cellular coverage. This solution emphasizes ease of deployment, minimal maintenance, and resilience to power and network disruptions. Using open-source software and widely available hardware, it offers a scalable, adaptable system for resource-limited settings. At under $30, the system is a sustainable, cost-effective solution for continuous patient monitoring, bridging the gap until more advanced healthcare infrastructure is available.</description>

      <title>Issues with Input-Space Representation in Nonlinear Data-Based Dissipativity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data-based control, dissipativity can be a powerful tool for attaining stability guarantees for nonlinear systems if that dissipativity can be inferred from data. This work provides a tutorial on several existing methods for data-based dissipativity estimation of nonlinear systems. The interplay between the underlying assumptions of these methods and their sample complexity is investigated. It is shown that methods based on delta-covering result in an intractable trade-off between sample complexity and robustness. A new method is proposed to quantify the robustness of machine learning-based dissipativity estimation. It is shown that this method achieves a more tractable trade-off between robustness and sample complexity. Several numerical case studies demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Why Anticipatory Sensing Matters in Commercial ACC Systems under Cut-In Scenarios: A Perspective from Stochastic Safety Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an analytical solution for the vehicle state evolution of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems under cut-in scenarios, incorporating sensing delays and anticipation using the Lambert W function. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the vehicle state evolution and the corresponding safety of ACC in cut-in situations are influenced by multiple factors, including the original leading vehicle's state, the initial conditions of the cut-in vehicle, subsequent cut-in maneuvers, sensing delays, and the ACC's anticipation capabilities. To quantitatively assess these influences, a series of numerical experiments were conducted to perform a stochastic safety analysis of ACC systems, accounting for embedded sensing delays and anticipation, using empirically calibrated control parameters from real-world data. The experiments revealed that the impact of sensing delays on ACC is multifaceted. Specifically, sensing delays negatively affect ACC stability, with the severity increasing as the delay lengthens. Furthermore, collision risk in cut-in scenarios becomes more significant with sensing delays, particularly when the cut-in vehicle is slower than the following vehicle and when cut-ins are aggressive. However, anticipation plays a crucial role in mitigating these risks. Even with a 0.6-second anticipation, collision risk can be reduced by 91% in highly adverse scenarios. Finally, both sensing delays and anticipation have effects that intensify with their duration. An anticipation period of 2 seconds effectively ensures safety in aggressive cut-in conditions, even in the presence of sensing delays.</description>

      <title>LEDRO: LLM-Enhanced Design Space Reduction and Optimization for Analog Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches for designing analog circuits are time-consuming and require significant human expertise. Existing automation efforts using methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sub-optimal and costly to generalize across different topologies and technology nodes. In our work, we introduce a novel approach, LEDRO, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with optimization techniques to iteratively refine the design space for analog circuit sizing. LEDRO is highly generalizable compared to other RL and BO baselines, eliminating the need for design annotation or model training for different topologies or technology nodes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed framework and baseline on 22 different Op-Amp topologies across four FinFET technology nodes. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEDRO as it outperforms our best baseline by an average of 13% FoM improvement with 2.15x speed-up on low complexity Op-Amps and 48% FoM improvement with 1.7x speed-up on high complexity Op-Amps. This highlights LEDRO's effective performance, efficiency, and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Bring the Heat: Rapid Trajectory Optimization with Pseudospectral Techniques and the Affine Geometric Heat Flow Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems in a time-efficient manner while adhering to constraints is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which works by discretizing one variable of the AGHF PDE, effectively converting the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and still requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. The proposed method PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim3$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Validation of Tumbling Robot Dynamics with Posture Manipulation for Closed-Loop Heading Angle Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating rugged terrain and steep slopes is a challenge for mobile robots. Conventional legged and wheeled systems struggle with these environments due to limited traction and stability. Northeastern University's COBRA (Crater Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator), a novel multi-modal snake-like robot, addresses these issues by combining traditional snake gaits for locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces with a tumbling mode for controlled descent on steep slopes. Through dynamic posture manipulation, COBRA can modulate its heading angle and velocity during tumbling. This paper presents a reduced-order cascade model for COBRA's tumbling locomotion and validates it against a high-fidelity rigid-body simulation, presenting simulation results that show that the model captures key system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extremum and Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Delays and PDEs: Designs &amp; Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of extremum seeking (ES) has progressed, over the past hundred years, from static maps, to finite-dimensional dynamic systems, to networks of static and dynamic agents. Extensions from ODE dynamics to maps and agents that incorporate delays or even partial differential equations (PDEs) is the next natural step in that progression through ascending research challenges. This paper reviews results on algorithm design and theory of ES for such infinite-dimensional systems. Both hyperbolic and parabolic dynamics are presented: delays or transport equations, heat-dominated equation, wave equations, and reaction-advection-diffusion equations. Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) methods are introduced for noncooperative game scenarios of the model-free kind and then specialized to single-agent optimization. Even heterogeneous PDE games, such as a duopoly with one parabolic and one hyperbolic agent, are considered. Several engineering applications are touched upon for illustration, including flow-traffic control for urban mobility, oil-drilling systems, deep-sea cable-actuated source seeking, additive manufacturing modeled by the Stefan PDE, biological reactors, light-source seeking with flexible-beam structures, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation.</description>

      <title>Explainable Finite-Memory Policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a fundamental framework for decision-making under uncertainty and partial observability. Since in general optimal policies may require infinite memory, they are hard to implement and often render most problems undecidable. Consequently, finite-memory policies are mostly considered instead. However, the algorithms for computing them are typically very complex, and so are the resulting policies. Facing the need for their explainability, we provide a representation of such policies, both (i) in an interpretable formalism and (ii) typically of smaller size, together yielding higher explainability. To that end, we combine models of Mealy machines and decision trees; the latter describing simple, stationary parts of the policies and the former describing how to switch among them. We design a translation for policies of the finite-state-controller (FSC) form from standard literature and show how our method smoothly generalizes to other variants of finite-memory policies. Further, we identify specific properties of recently used "attractor-based" policies, which allow us to construct yet simpler and smaller representations. Finally, we illustrate the higher explainability in a few case studies.</description>

      <title>REVISE: Robust Probabilistic Motion Planning in a Gaussian Random Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Robust samplE-based coVarIance StEering (REVISE), a multi-query algorithm that generates robust belief roadmaps for dynamic systems navigating through spatially dependent disturbances modeled as a Gaussian random field. Our proposed method develops a novel robust sample-based covariance steering edge controller to safely steer a robot between state distributions, satisfying state constraints along the trajectory. Our proposed approach also incorporates an edge rewiring step into the belief roadmap construction process, which provably improves the coverage of the belief roadmap. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, REVISE improves median plan accuracy (as measured by Wasserstein distance between the actual and planned final state distribution) by 10x in multi-query planning and reduces median plan cost (as measured by the largest eigenvalue of the planned state covariance at the goal) by 2.5x in single-query planning for a 6DoF system. We will release our code at https://acl.mit.edu/REVISE/.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of API Design for Interoperability and Security of the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous distributed systems, including the Internet of Things (IoT) or distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS), often suffer a lack of interoperability and security, which hinders the wider deployment of such systems. Specifically, the different levels of security requirements and the heterogeneity in terms of communication models, for instance, point-to-point vs. publish-subscribe, are the example challenges of IoT and distributed CPS consisting of heterogeneous devices and applications. In this paper, we propose a working application programming interface (API) and runtime to enhance interoperability and security while addressing the challenges that stem from the heterogeneity in the IoT and distributed CPS. In our case study, we design and implement our application programming interface (API) design approach using open-source software, and with our working implementation, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our experimental results suggest that our approach can achieve both interoperability and security in the IoT and distributed CPS with a reasonably small overhead and better-managed software.</description>

      <title>Bezier Reachable Polytopes: Efficient Certificates for Robust Motion Planning with Layered Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control architectures are often implemented in a layered fashion, combining independently designed blocks to achieve complex tasks. Providing guarantees for such hierarchical frameworks requires considering the capabilities and limitations of each layer and their interconnections at design time. To address this holistic design challenge, we introduce the notion of Bezier Reachable Polytopes -- certificates of reachable points in the space of Bezier polynomial reference trajectories. This approach captures the set of trajectories that can be tracked by a low-level controller while satisfying state and input constraints, and leverages the geometric properties of Bezier polynomials to maintain an efficient polytopic representation. As a result, these certificates serve as a constructive tool for layered architectures, enabling long-horizon tasks to be reasoned about in a computationally tractable manner.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Feasible Path Planning in Cluttered Environments via Reachable Bezier Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of robotic systems in real world environments requires the ability to quickly produce paths through cluttered, non-convex spaces. These planned trajectories must be both kinematically feasible (i.e., collision free) and dynamically feasible (i.e., satisfy the underlying system dynamics), necessitating a consideration of both the free space and the dynamics of the robot in the path planning phase. In this work, we explore the application of reachable Bezier polytopes as an efficient tool for generating trajectories satisfying both kinematic and dynamic requirements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by offloading specific computation tasks to the GPU, such an algorithm can meet tight real time requirements. We propose a layered control architecture that efficiently produces collision free and dynamically feasible paths for nonlinear control systems, and demonstrate the framework on the tasks of 3D hopping in a cluttered environment.</description>

      <title>From Discrete to Continuous Binary Best-Response Dynamics: Discrete Fluctuations Almost Surely Vanish with Population Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In binary decision-makings, individuals often go for a common or rare action. In the framework of evolutionary game theory, the best-response update rule can be used to model this dichotomy. Those who prefer a common action are called \emph{coordinators}, and those who prefer a rare one are called \emph{anticoordinators}. A finite mixed population of the two types may undergo perpetual fluctuations, the characterization of which appears to be challenging. It is particularly unknown whether the fluctuations persist as population size grows. To fill this gap, we approximate the discrete finite population dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators with the associated mean dynamics in the form of semicontinuous differential inclusions. We show that the family of the state sequences of the discrete dynamics for increasing population sizes forms a generalized stochastic approximation process for the differential inclusion. On the other hand, we show that the differential inclusions always converge to an equilibrium. This implies that the reported perpetual fluctuations in the finite discrete dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators almost surely vanish with population size. The results encourage to first analyze the often simpler semicontinuous mean dynamics of the discrete population dynamics as the semicontinuous dynamics partly reveal the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enabling Large Language Models to Perform Power System Simulations with Previously Unseen Tools: A Case of Daline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of experiment technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research, offering AI capabilities beyond specialized problem-solving to becoming research assistants for human scientists. In power systems, simulations are essential for research. However, LLMs face significant challenges in power system simulations due to limited pre-existing knowledge and the complexity of power grids. To address this issue, this work proposes a modular framework that integrates expertise from both the power system and LLM domains. This framework enhances LLMs' ability to perform power system simulations on previously unseen tools. Validated using 34 simulation tasks in Daline, a (optimal) power flow simulation and linearization toolbox not yet exposed to LLMs, the proposed framework improved GPT-4o's simulation coding accuracy from 0% to 96.07%, also outperforming the ChatGPT-4o web interface's 33.8% accuracy (with the entire knowledge base uploaded). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as research assistants in power systems.</description>

      <title>Data-informativity conditions for structured linear systems with implications for dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When estimating models of a multivariable dynamic system, a typical condition for consistency is to require the input signals to be persistently exciting, which is guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. In this paper it is investigated how such a condition can be relaxed by exploiting prior structural information on the multivariable system, such as structural zero elements in the transfer matrix or entries that are a priori known and therefore not parametrized. It is shown that in particular situations the data-informativity condition can be decomposed into different MISO (multiple input single output) situations, leading to relaxed conditions for the MIMO (multiple input multiple output) model. When estimating a single module in a linear dynamic network, the data-informativity conditions can generically be formulated as path-based conditions on the graph of the network. The new relaxed conditions for data-informativity will then also lead to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. Additionally the new expressions are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.</description>

      <title>Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Collision-free Source Seeking Control Methods for Unicycle Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a collision-free source-seeking control framework for a unicycle robot traversing an unknown cluttered environment. In this framework, obstacle avoidance is guided by the control barrier functions (CBF) embedded in quadratic programming, and the source-seeking control relies solely on the use of onboard sensors that measure the signal strength of the source. To tackle the mixed relative degree and avoid the undesired position offset for the nonholonomic unicycle model, we propose a novel construction of a control barrier function (CBF) that can directly be integrated with our recent gradient-ascent source-seeking control law. We present a rigorous analysis of the approach. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated via Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as, using a realistic dynamic environment with moving obstacles in Gazebo/ROS.</description>

      <title>Toward Multi-Layer Networking for Satellite Network Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites aim to bring resilience, ubiquitous, and high-quality service to future Internet infrastructure. However, the soaring number of space assets, increasing dynamics of LEO satellites and expanding dimensions of network threats call for an enhanced approach to efficient satellite operations. To address these pressing challenges, we propose an approach for satellite network operations based on multi-layer satellite networking (MLSN), called "SatNetOps". Two SatNetOps schemes are proposed, referred to as LEO-LEO MLSN (LLM) and GEO-LEO MLSN (GLM). The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated in 24-hr satellite scenarios with typical payload setups in simulations, where the key metrics such as latency and reliability are discussed with the consideration of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard-compliant telemetry and telecommand missions. Although the SatNetOps approach is promising, we analyze the factors affecting the performance of the LLM and GLM schemes. The discussions on the results and conclusive remarks are made in the end.</description>

      <title>Harpocrates: A Statically Typed Privacy Conscious Programming Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Harpocrates, a compiler plugin and a framework pair for Scala that binds the privacy policies to the data during data creation in form of oblivious membranes. Harpocrates eliminates raw data for a policy protected type from the application, ensuring it can only exist in protected form and centralizes the policy checking to the policy declaration site, making the privacy logic easy to maintain and verify. Instead of approaching privacy from an information flow verification perspective, Harpocrates allow the data to flow freely throughout the application, inside the policy membranes but enforces the policies when the data is tried to be accessed, mutated, declassified or passed through the application boundary. The centralization of the policies allow the maintainers to change the enforced logic simply by updating a single function while keeping the rest of the application oblivious to the change. Especially in a setting where the data definition is shared by multiple applications, the publisher can update the policies without requiring the dependent applications to make any changes beyond updating the dependency version.</description>

      <title>$\mathscr{H}_2$ Model Reduction for Linear Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an $\mathscr{H}_2$ norm-based model reduction method for linear quantum systems is presented, which can obtain a physically realizable model with a reduced order for closely approximating the original system. The model reduction problem is described as an optimization problem, whose objective is taken as an $\mathscr{H}_2$ norm of the difference between the transfer function of the original system and that of the reduced one. Different from classical model reduction problems, physical realizability conditions for guaranteeing that the reduced-order system is also a quantum system should be taken as nonlinear constraints in the optimization. To solve the optimization problem with such nonlinear constraints, we employ a matrix inequality approach to transform nonlinear inequality constraints into readily solvable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and nonlinear equality constraints, so that the optimization problem can be solved by a lifting variables approach. We emphasize that different from existing work, which only introduces a criterion to evaluate the performance after model reduction, we guide our method to obtain an optimal reduced model with respect to the $\mathscr{H}_2$ norm. In addition, the above approach for model reduction is extended to passive linear quantum systems. Finally, examples of active and passive linear quantum systems validate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Systematic LMI Approach to Design Multivariable Sliding Mode Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with sliding mode control for multivariable polytopic uncertain systems. We provide systematic procedures to design variable structure controllers (VSCs) and unit-vector controllers (UVCs). Based on suitable representations for the closed-loop system, we derive sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to design the robust sliding mode controllers such that the origin of the closed-loop system is globally stable in finite time. Moreover, by noticing that the reaching time depends on the initial condition and the decay rate, we provide convex optimization problems to design robust controllers by considering the minimization of the reaching time associated with a given set of initial conditions. Two examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>
