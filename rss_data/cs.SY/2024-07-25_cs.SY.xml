      <title>Learning Networked Dynamical System Models with Weak Form and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman-based Control of Quality Variation in Multistage Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a modeling-control synthesis to address the quality control challenges in multistage manufacturing systems (MMSs). A new feedforward control scheme is developed to minimize the quality variations caused by process disturbances in MMSs. Notably, the control framework leverages a stochastic deep Koopman (SDK) model to capture the quality propagation mechanism in the MMSs, highlighted by its ability to transform the nonlinear propagation dynamics into a linear one. Two roll-to-roll case studies are presented to validate the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness. The overall method is suitable for nonlinear MMSs and does not require extensive expert knowledge.</description>

      <title>Towards Indirect Data-Driven Predictive Control for Heating Phase of Thermoforming Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaping thermoplastic sheets into three-dimensional products is challenging since overheating results in failed manufactured parts and wasted material. To this end, we propose an indirect data-driven predictive control approach using Model Predictive Control (MPC) capable of handling temperature constraints and heating-power saturation while delivering enhanced precision, overshoot control, and settling times compared to state-of-the-art methods. We employ a Non-linear Auto-Regressive with Exogenous inputs (NARX) model to define a linear control-oriented model at each operating point. Using a high-fidelity simulator, several simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the proposed method's robustness and performance under parametric uncertainty, indicating overshoot and average steady-state error less than $2^\circ \mathrm{C}$ and $0.7^\circ \mathrm{C}$ ($7^\circ \mathrm{C}$ and $2^\circ \mathrm{C}$) for the nominal (worst-case) scenario. Finally, we applied the proposed method to a lab-scale thermoforming platform, resulting in a close response to the simulation analysis with overshoot and average steady-state error metrics less than $5.3^\circ \mathrm{C}$ and $1^\circ \mathrm{C}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>MoULDyS: Monitoring of Autonomous Systems in the Presence of Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MoULDyS, that implements efficient offline and online monitoring algorithms of black-box cyber-physical systems w.r.t. safety properties. MoULDyS takes as input an uncertain log (with noisy and missing samples), as well as a bounding model in the form of an uncertain linear system; this latter model plays the role of an over-approximation so as to reduce the number of false alarms. MoULDyS is Python-based and available under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (gpl-3.0). We further provide easy-to-use scripts to recreate the results of two case studies introduced in an earlier work.</description>

      <title>An MDP-Based Approach for Distribution System Control with PV Generation and Battery Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a decision-making approach for the control of distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs) equipped with photovoltaic (PV) units and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The objective is to minimize the total operational cost of the distribution system while satisfying the system operating constraints. The method is based on the discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Different aspects of the operation of the distribution system operation are considered, such as the possibilities of curtailment of PV generation, managing battery storage, reactive power injection, load shedding, and providing a flexibility service for the transmission system. The model is tested for the IEEE 33-bus system with two added DERs and the study cases involve various unexpected events. The experimental results show that this method enables the attainment of relatively low total cost values compared to the reference deterministic approach. The benefits of applying this approach are particularly evident when there is a significant difference between the predicted and actual PV power generation.</description>

      <title>From Data to Predictive Control: A Framework for Stochastic Linear Systems with Output Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce data to predictive control, D2PC, a framework to facilitate the design of robust and predictive controllers from data. The proposed framework is designed for discrete-time stochastic linear systems with output measurements and provides a principled design of a predictive controller based on data. The framework starts with a parameter identification method based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which incorporates pre-defined structural constraints. Additionally, we provide an asymptotically correct method to quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates. Next, we develop a strategy to synthesize robust dynamic output-feedback controllers tailored to the derived uncertainty characterization. Finally, we introduce a predictive control scheme that guarantees recursive feasibility and satisfaction of chance constraints. This framework marks a significant advancement in integrating data into robust and predictive control schemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of D2PC through a numerical example involving a $10$-dimensional spring-mass-damper system.</description>

      <title>Distributed Difference of Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on solving a class of distributed optimization problems involving $n$ agents with the local objective function at every agent $i$ given by the difference of two convex functions $f_i$ and $g_i$ (difference-of-convex (DC) form), where $f_i$ and $g_i$ are potentially nonsmooth. The agents communicate via a directed graph containing $n$ nodes. We create smooth approximations of the functions $f_i$ and $g_i$ and develop a distributed algorithm utilizing the gradients of the smooth surrogates and a finite-time approximate consensus protocol. We term this algorithm as DDC-Consensus. The developed DDC-Consensus algorithm allows for non-symmetric directed graph topologies and can be synthesized distributively. We establish that the DDC-Consensus algorithm converges to a stationary point of the nonconvex distributed optimization problem. The performance of the DDC-Consensus algorithm is evaluated via a simulation study to solve a nonconvex DC-regularized distributed least squares problem. The numerical results corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Adaptive Robotics for Autonomous Surface Crack Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface cracks in infrastructure can lead to significant deterioration and costly maintenance if not efficiently repaired. Manual repair methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and imprecise and thus difficult to scale to large areas. Breakthroughs in robotic perception and manipulation have advanced autonomous crack repair, but proposed methods lack end-to-end testing and adaptability to changing crack size. This paper presents an adaptive, autonomous system for surface crack detection and repair using robotics with advanced sensing technologies. The system uses an RGB-D camera for crack detection, a laser scanner for precise measurement, and an extruder and pump for material deposition. A novel validation procedure with 3D-printed crack specimens simulates real-world cracks and ensures testing repeatability. Our study shows that an adaptive system for crack filling is more efficient and effective than a fixed-speed approach, with experimental results confirming precision and consistency. This research paves the way for versatile, reliable robotic infrastructure maintenance.</description>

      <title>Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</description>

      <title>The Magnificent Seven Challenges and Opportunities in Domain-Specific Accelerator Design for Autonomous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The end of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling has combined with advances in agile hardware design to foster a golden age of domain-specific acceleration. However, this new frontier of computing opportunities is not without pitfalls. As computer architects approach unfamiliar domains, we have seen common themes emerge in the challenges that can hinder progress in the development of useful acceleration. In this work, we present the Magnificent Seven Challenges in domain-specific accelerator design that can guide adventurous architects to contribute meaningfully to novel application domains. Although these challenges appear across domains ranging from ML to genomics, we examine them through the lens of autonomous systems as a motivating example in this work. To that end, we identify opportunities for the path forward in a successful domain-specific accelerator design from these challenges.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Analytical Design Procedure for Distributed Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple while comprehensive analytical design procedure for distributed amplifiers. Distributed amplifiers are attractive for designers due to their wideband capability. When designing a distributed amplifier, the first question that comes to mind is how wide the bandwidth can be. This paper answers this question by using the self-matching and low-pass properties of a distributed amplifier. Self-matching property of a distributed power amplifier is an interesting point that distinguishes it from other types of power amplifiers that are usually based on input and output matching networks. Here the estimation of the bandwidth of a distributed amplifier structure is discussed. The equations that are used in this paper can bring good insight and they can assist designers. Furthermore, we have explained the frequency behavior of a tapered distributed amplifier analytically for the first time. In order to validate the approach presented here, we have used published designs including our previously published design as practical examples. The flowchart of the design procedure is also provided.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted. The supplementary simulation video can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxbUN0tn1M.</description>

      <title>SoNIC: Safe Social Navigation with Adaptive Conformal Inference and Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled social robots to generate trajectories without human-designed rules or interventions, which makes it more effective than hard-coded systems for generalizing to complex real-world scenarios. However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians while previous RL-based solutions fall short in safety performance in complex environments. To enhance the safety of RL policies, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first algorithm, SoNIC, that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to learn safe policies for social navigation. More specifically, our method augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores and provides explicit guidance for agents to leverage the uncertainty metrics to avoid safety-critical areas by incorporating safety constraints with spatial relaxation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both safety and adherence to social norms by a large margin and demonstrates much stronger robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. Our code and video demos are available on our project website: https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Toward human-centered shared autonomy AI paradigms for human-robot teaming in healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent advancements in AI and computation tools, intelligent paradigms emerged to empower different fields such as healthcare robots with new capabilities. Advanced AI robotic algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can be trained and developed to autonomously make individual decisions to achieve a desired and usually fixed goal. However, such independent decisions and goal achievements might not be ideal for a healthcare robot that usually interacts with a dynamic end-user or a patient. In such a complex human-robot interaction (teaming) framework, the dynamic user continuously wants to be involved in decision-making as well as introducing new goals while interacting with their present environment in real-time. To address this challenge, an adaptive shared autonomy AI paradigm is required to be developed for the two interactive agents (Human &amp; AI agents) with a foundation based on human-centered factors to avoid any possible ethical issues and guarantee no harm to humanity.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Trajectory Tracking under Learned Dynamics with Contraction Metrics and Disturbance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08222v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to trajectory-centric learning control based on contraction metrics and disturbance estimation for nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties. The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</description>

      <title>Frequency Stability-Constrained Unit Commitment: Tight Approximation using Bernstein Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we replace conventional synchronous generators with renewable energy, the frequency security of power systems is at higher risk. This calls for a more careful consideration of unit commitment (UC) and primary frequency response (PFR) reserves. This paper studies frequency-secured UC under significant wind power uncertainty. We coordinate the thermal units and wind farms to provide frequency support, wherein we optimize the variable inverter droop factors of the wind farms for higher economy. In addition, we adopt distributionally robust chance constraints (DRCCs) to handle the wind power uncertainty. To depict the frequency dynamics, we incorporate a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) with the dead band into the UC model. Notably, we apply Bernstein polynomials to derive tight inner approximation of the DAE and obtain mixed-integer linear constraints, which can be computed in off-the-shelf solvers. Case studies demonstrate the tightness and effectiveness of the proposed method in guaranteeing frequency security.</description>

      <title>$k$-Contraction in a Generalized Lurie System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07514</link>

Abstract: We derive a sufficient condition for $k$-contraction in a generalized Lurie system (GLS), that is, the feedback connection of a nonlinear dynamical system and a memoryless nonlinear function. For $k=1$, this reduces to a sufficient condition for standard contraction. For $k=2$, this condition implies that every bounded solution of the GLS converges to an equilibrium, which is not necessarily unique. We demonstrate the theoretical results by analyzing $k$-contraction in a biochemical control circuit with nonlinear dissipation terms.</description>

      <title>Age of Computing: A Metric of Computation Freshness in Communication and Computation Cooperative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05007v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In communication and computation cooperative networks (3CNs), timely computation is crucial but not always guaranteed. There is a strong demand for a computational task to be completed within a given deadline. The time taken involves both processing time, communication time, and the impact of the deadline. However, a measure of such timeliness in 3CNs is lacking. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept, Age of Computing (AoC), to capture computation freshness in 3CNs. We analyze AoC in a line topology consisting of a source, a transmitter, a receiver, and a computational node. Tasks generated by the source are immediately available at the transmitter, where they enter a communication queue. These tasks then pass to the receiver and subsequently to a computation queue at the computational node for processing. Each task has a deadline, requiring completion within this timeframe. AoC is evaluated under two types of deadlines: (i) soft deadline, tasks can be fed back to the source if delayed beyond the deadline, but with additional latency; (ii) hard deadline, tasks delayed beyond the deadline are discarded. Under both deadlines, we derive the AoC formula and a general expression for the time-average AoC. For the first-come, first-serve discipline, we obtain a closed-form expression for the average AoC under the soft deadline and an approximation for the hard deadline. In addition to freshness, we define computation throughput, providing a general expression and an approximation. To explore the relationship between freshness and throughput, we construct an optimization problem and prove that the objective pair is a weakly Pareto-optimal point. Numerical results validate all the theoretical findings. Additionally, they reveal that under the hard deadline, the computation throughput serves as a reliable proxy for the average AoC.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Waveform Generated Metasurface: A New Paradigm for Direct Modulation and Beamforming Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information Metasurface, also known as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has gained significant attention owing to its impressive abilities in electromagnetic (EM) wave manipulation with simple structures. Numerous studies focus on achieving efficient and versatile information transmission using RIS across various fields like wireless communication, radar detection, integrated sensing, and communications, among others. Previous studies demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve reflection modulation by utilizing the superposition of the quantified reflection coefficient (RC) of each unit but suffer from the computing complexity of codebook sequence, the safety of communication, and the flexibility of modulation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel concept of information metasurface, namely AWG-RIS, which is capable of independently producing arbitrary baseband waveforms and beam patterns through a design that decouples magnitude and phase, without changing the beam pattern. The AWG-RIS functions as a reflection mixer, directly embedding the intended signal into the incoming EM waves. Subsequently, we developed an analysis framework and introduced the waveform factor and beamforming factor into the new model, offering theoretical support for the transition from the control signal to the outgoing electromagnetic wave. Additionally, we unveil the world's first prototype showcasing passive arbitrary waveform generation while maintaining the beam pattern unaltered. Leveraging the decoupling of direct modulation and beamforming, we explore additional applications in several domains relative to traditional RISs. Finally, we present experiments that confirm the generation of arbitrary waveforms and particular spectrograms.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Interference Mitigation for Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications systems due to its capability to provide access for multiple users on the same resource. In this paper, we consider an uplink power-domain NOMA system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in the presence of a jammer that aims to maximize its interference on the base station (BS) uplink receiver. We consider two kinds of RISs, a regular RIS whose elements can only change the phase of the incoming wave, and an RIS whose elements can also attenuate the incoming wave. Our aim is to minimize the total power transmitted by the user terminals under quality-of-service constraints by controlling both the propagation from the users and the jammer to the BS with help of the RIS. The resulting objective function and constraints are both non-linear and non-convex, so we address this problem using numerical optimization. Our numerical results show that the RIS can help to dramatically reduce the per user required transmit power in an interference-limited scenario.</description>

      <title>AI/ML for Beam Management in 5G-Advanced: A Standardization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In beamformed wireless cellular systems such as 5G New Radio (NR) networks, beam management (BM) is a crucial operation. In the second phase of 5G NR standardization, known as 5G-Advanced, which is being vigorously promoted, the key component is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning (ML) techniques. AI/ML for BM is selected as a representative use case. This article provides an overview of the AI/ML for BM in 5G-Advanced. The legacy non-AI and prime AI-enabled BM frameworks are first introduced and compared. Then, the main scope of AI/ML for BM is presented, including improving accuracy, reducing overhead and latency. Finally, the key challenges and open issues in the standardization of AI/ML for BM are discussed, especially the design of new protocols for AI-enabled BM. This article provides a guideline for the study of AI/ML-based BM standardization.</description>

      <title>Shortest-path recovery from signature with an optimal control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the signature-to-path reconstruction problem from the control theoretic perspective. Namely, we design an optimal control problem whose solution leads to the minimal-length path that generates a given signature. In order to do that, we minimize a cost functional consisting of two competing terms, i.e., a weighted final-time cost combined with the $L^2$-norm squared of the controls. Moreover, we can show that, by taking the limit to infinity of the parameter that tunes the final-time cost, the problem $\Gamma$-converges to the problem of finding a sub-Riemannian geodesic connecting two signatures. Finally, we provide an alternative reformulation of the latter problem, which is particularly suitable for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Learning Based NMPC Adaptation for Autonomous Driving using Parallelized Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the challenge of transferring an autonomous driving controller from simulation to the real world (i.e. Sim2Real). We propose a data-efficient method for online and on-the-fly adaptation of parametrizable control architectures such that the target closed-loop performance is optimized while accounting for uncertainties as model mismatches, changes in the environment, and task variations. The novelty of the approach resides in leveraging black-box optimization enabled by Executable Digital Twins (xDTs) for data-driven parameter calibration through derivative-free methods to directly adapt the controller in real-time. The xDTs are augmented with Domain Randomization for robustness and allow for safe parameter exploration. The proposed method requires a minimal amount of interaction with the real-world as it pushes the exploration towards the xDTs. We validate our approach through real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in transferring and fine-tuning a NMPC with 9 parameters, in under 10 minutes. This eliminates the need for hours-long manual tuning and lengthy machine learning training and data collection phases. Our results show that the online adapted NMPC directly compensates for the Sim2Real gap and avoids overtuning in simulation. Importantly, a 75% improvement in tracking performance is achieved and the Sim2Real gap over the target performance is reduced from a factor of 876 to 1.033.</description>

      <title>EKF-SINDy: Empowering the extended Kalman filter with sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measured data from a dynamical system can be assimilated into a predictive model by means of Kalman filters. Nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), are required to enable the joint estimation of (possibly nonlinear) system dynamics and of input parameters. To construct the evolution model used in the prediction phase of the EKF, we propose to rely on the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). SINDy enables to identify the evolution model directly from preliminary acquired data, thus avoiding possible bias due to wrong assumptions and incorrect modelling of the system dynamics. Moreover, the numerical integration of a SINDy model leads to great computational savings compared to alternate strategies based on, e.g., finite elements. Last, SINDy allows an immediate definition of the Jacobian matrices required by the EKF to identify system dynamics and properties, a derivation that is usually extremely involved with physical models. As a result, combining the EKF with SINDy provides a data-driven computationally efficient, easy-to-apply approach for the identification of nonlinear systems, capable of robust operation even outside the range of training of SINDy. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we address the identification of a linear non-autonomous system consisting of a shear building model excited by real seismograms, and the identification of a partially observed nonlinear system. The challenge arising from the use of SINDy when the system state is not entirely accessible has been relieved by means of time-delay embedding. The great accuracy and the small uncertainty associated with the state identification, where the state has been augmented to include system properties, underscores the great potential of the proposed strategy, paving the way for the setting of predictive digital twins in different fields.</description>
