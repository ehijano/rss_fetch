      <title>Semi-Separable Mechanisms in Multi-Item Robust Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally challenging to characterize the optimal selling mechanism even when the seller knows the buyer's valuation distributions in multi-item screening. An insightful and significant result in robust mechanism design literature is that if the seller knows only marginal distributions of the buyer's valuation, then separable mechanisms, in which all items are sold independently, are robustly optimal under the maximin revenue objectives. While the separable mechanism is simple to implement, the literature also indicates that separate selling can not guarantee any substantial fraction of the potential optimal revenue for given distributions. To design a simple mechanism with a good performance guarantee, we introduce a novel class of mechanisms, termed "semi-separable mechanism". In these mechanisms, the allocation and payment rule of each item is a function solely of the corresponding item's valuation, which retains the separable mechanism's practical simplicity. However, the design of the allocation and payment function is enhanced by leveraging the joint distributional information, thereby improving the performance guarantee against the hindsight optimal revenue. We establish that a semi-separable mechanism achieves the optimal performance ratio among all incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanisms when only marginal support information is known. This result demonstrates that the semi-separable mechanisms ensure both the interpretation and implementation simplicity, and performance superiority. Our framework is also applicable to scenarios where the seller possesses information about the aggregate valuations of product bundles within any given partition of the product set. Furthermore, our results also provide guidelines for the multi-item screening problem with non-standard ambiguity sets.</description>

      <title>Informativeness and Trust in Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persuasion policy successfully persuades an agent to pick a particular action only if the information is designed in a manner that convinces the agent that it is in their best interest to pick that action. Thus, it is natural to ask, what makes the agent trust the persuader's suggestion? We study a Bayesian persuasion interaction between a sender and a receiver where the sender has access to private information and the receiver attempts to recover this information from messages sent by the sender. The sender crafts these messages in an attempt to maximize its utility which depends on the source symbol and the symbol recovered by the receiver. Our goal is to characterize the \textit{Stackelberg game value}, and the amount of true information revealed by the sender during persuasion. We find that the SGV is given by the optimal value of a \textit{linear program} on probability distributions constrained by certain \textit{trust constraints}. These constraints encode that any signal in a persuasion strategy must contain more truth than untruth and thus impose a fundamental bound on the extent of obfuscation a sender can perform. We define \textit{informativeness} of the sender as the minimum expected number of symbols truthfully revealed by the sender in any accumulation point of a sequence of $\varepsilon$-equilibrium persuasion strategies, and show that it is given by another linear program. Informativeness is a fundamental bound on the amount of information the sender must reveal to persuade a receiver. Closed form expressions for the SGV and the informativeness are presented for structured utility functions. This work generalizes our previous work where the sender and the receiver were constrained to play only deterministic strategies and a similar notion of informativeness was characterized. Comparisons between the previous and current notions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A topological proof of Terao's generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Terao [24], Hiroaki Terao defined and studied "admissible map", which is a generalization of "social welfare function" in the context of hyperplane arrangements. Using this, he proved a generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem using combinatorial arguments. This paper provides another proof of this generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, using the idea of algebraic topology.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Limited Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05546v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limited strategic leadership. A collection of subsets covering the leader's action space determines her commitment opportunities. We characterize the outcomes resulting from all possible commitment structures of this kind. If the commitment structure is an interval partition, then the leader's payoff is bounded by her Stackelberg and Cournot payoffs. However, under more general commitment structures the leader may obtain a payoff that is less than her minimum Cournot payoff. We apply our results to study information design problems in leader-follower games where a mediator communicates information about the leader's action to the follower.</description>

      <title>Incentives in Social Decision Schemes with Pairwise Comparison Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social decision schemes (SDSs) map the ordinal preferences of individual voters over multiple alternatives to a probability distribution over the alternatives. In order to study the axiomatic properties of SDSs, we lift preferences over alternatives to preferences over lotteries using the natural -- but little understood -- pairwise comparison (PC) preference extension. This extension postulates that one lottery is preferred to another if the former is more likely to return a preferred outcome. We settle three open questions raised by Brandt (2017): (i) there is no Condorcet-consistent SDS that satisfies PC-strategyproofness; (ii) there is no anonymous and neutral SDS that satisfies PC-efficiency and PC-strategyproofness; and (iii) there is no anonymous and neutral SDS that satisfies PC-efficiency and strict PC-participation. All three impossibilities require $m\geq 4$ alternatives and turn into possibilities when $m\leq 3$. We furthermore settle an open problem raised by Aziz et al. (2015) by showing that no path of PC-improvements originating from an inefficient lottery may lead to a PC-efficient lottery.</description>
