      <title>On rectifiability of Delone sets in intermediate regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with Delone sets and their rectifiability under different classes of regularity. By pursuing techniques developed by Rivi\`ere and Ye, and Aliste-Prieto, Coronel and Gambaudo, we give sufficient conditions for a Delone set to be equivalent to the standard lattice by bijections having regularity in between bi-Lipschitz and bi-H\"older-homogeneous. From this criterion, we improve a result of McMullen by showing that, for any dimension $d\geq 1$, there exists a threshold of moduli of continuity $\mathcal{M}_d$, including the class of the H\"{o}lder ones, such that for every $\omega\in\mathcal{M}_d$, any two Delone sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be distinguished under bi-$\omega$-equivalence. Also, we extend a result due to Aliste, Coronel, and Gambaudo, which establishes that every linearly repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is rectifiable by extending it to a broader class of repetitive behaviors. Moreover, we show that for the modulus of continuity $\omega(t)=t(\log(1/t))^{1/d}$, every $\omega$-repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is equivalent to the standard lattice by a bi-$\omega$-homogeneous map. Finally, we address a problem of continuous nature related to the previous ones about finding solutions to the prescribed volume form equation in intermediate regularity, thereby extending the results of Rivi\`ere and Ye.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances between quotient metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hausdorff distance measures how far apart two sets are in a common metric space. By contrast, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance provides a notion of distance between two abstract metric spaces. How do these distances behave for quotients of spaces under group actions? Suppose a group $G$ acts by isometries on two metric spaces $X$ and $Y$. In this article, we study how the Hausdorff and Gromov-Hausdorff distances between $X$ and $Y$ and their quotient spaces $X/G$ and $Y/G$ are related. For the Hausdorff distance, we show that if $X$ and $Y$ are $G$-invariant subsets of a common metric space, then we have $d_{\mathrm{H}}(X,Y)=d_{\mathrm{H}}(X/G,Y/G)$. However, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance does not preserve this relationship: we show how to make the ratio $\frac{d_{\mathrm{GH}}(X/G,Y/G)}{d_{\mathrm{GH}}(X,Y)}$ both arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small, even if $X$ is an arbitrarily dense $G$-invariant subset of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic theory of $C$-pseudo-cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an asymptotic view for any $C$-pseudo-cone, which allows us to decompose a $C$-pseudo-cone $E$ into the sum of a $C$-asymptotic set $\mathbb{A}$ and $C$-starting point $z\in C$ of $E$. Combining this with the novel work by Schneider, we introduce the asymptotic weighted co-volume functional $T_\Theta(E)$ of the $C$-pseudo-cone $E$, which is also a generalized function with the singular point $o$ (the origin). Using our convolution formula for $T_\Theta(E)$, we establish a decay estimate for $T_\Theta(E)$ at infinity and present some interesting results. As applications of this asymptotic theory, we prove a weighted Brunn-Minkowski type inequality and study the solutions to the weighted Minkowski problem for pseudo-cones. Moreover, we pose an open problem regarding $T_\Theta(E)$, which we call the asymptotic Brunn-Minkowski inequality for $C$-pseudo-cones.</description>

      <title>Radii of Euclidean sections of $\ell_p$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Dvoretzky theorem asserts that every $N$-dimensional convex body admits central sections of dimension $d = \Omega(\log N)$, which is nearly spherical. For many instances of convex bodies, typically unit balls with respect to some norm, much better lower bounds on $d$ have been obtained, with most research focusing on such lower bounds and on the degree of approximation of the section by a $k$-dimensional Euclidean ball. In this note we focus on another parameter, namely the radius of the approximating ball. We focus on the case of the unit ball of the space $\ell_1^N$ (the so-called cross-polytope), which is relevant to various questions of interest in theoretical computer science. We will also survey other instances where similar questions for other normed spaces (most often $\ell_p$-spaces or their non-commutative analogues) were found relevant to problems in various areas of mathematics and its applications, and state some open problems. Finally, in view of the computer science ramifications, we will comment on the algorithmic aspects of finding nearly spherical sections.</description>

Abstract: A family of 4-dimensional lattices $L_k \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is defined. Each lattice is defined by 2 quadratic extensions and has a \emph{finite} number of unit vectors, but the number of unit vectors in the family is \emph{unbounded}. $L_3$ is the Moser lattice.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Stability of Travel Time Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the reconstruction of a certain type of length spaces from their travel time data on a closed subset is Lipschitz stable. The travel time data is the set of distance functions from the entire space, measured on the chosen closed subset. The case of a Riemannian manifold with boundary with the boundary as the measurement set appears is a classical geometric inverse problem arising from Gel'fand's inverse boundary spectral problem. Examples of spaces satisfying our assumptions include some non-simple Riemannian manifolds, Euclidean domains with non-trivial topology, and metric trees.</description>

      <title>Diffusions and random walks with prescribed sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given suitable functions $V, \Psi:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $V,\Psi$ for the existence of a metric measure space and a symmetric diffusion process that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with volume growth profile $V$ and escape time profile $\Psi$. We prove sufficiency by constructing a new family of diffusions. Special cases of this construction also leads to a new family of infinite graphs whose simple random walks satisfy sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with prescribed volume growth and escape time profiles. In particular, these random walks on graphs generalizes earlier results of Barlow who considered the case $V(r)=r^\alpha$ and $\Psi(r)=r^\beta$ (Rev Mat Iberoam 2004). The family of diffusions we construct have martingale dimension one but can have arbitrarily high spectral dimension. Therefore our construction shows the impossibility of obtaining non-trivial \emph{lower} bounds on martingale dimension in terms of spectral dimension which is in contrast with upper bounds on martingale dimension using spectral dimension obtained by Hino (Probab Theory Relat Fields 2013).</description>

      <title>Carnot rectifiability and Alberti representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A metric measure space is said to be Carnot-rectifiable if it can be covered up to a null set by countably many biLipschitz images of compact sets of a fixed Carnot group. In this paper, we give several characterisations of such notion of rectifiability both in terms of Alberti representations of the measure and in terms of differentiability of Lipschitz maps with values in Carnot groups.
  In order to obtain this characterisation, we develop and study the analogue of the notion of Lipschitz differentiability space by Cheeger, using Carnot groups and Pansu derivatives as models. We call such metric measure spaces Pansu differentiability spaces (PDS).</description>

      <title>On the volume of convolution bodies in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every convex body $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ and $\delta \in (0,1)$, the $\delta$-convolution body of $K$ is the set of $x \in \mathbb R^n$ for which $\left|K \cap (K+x)\right|_n \geq \delta \left|K\right|_n$.
  We show that for $n=2$ and any $\delta \in (0,1)$, ellipsoids do not maximize the volume of the $\delta$-convolution body of $K$, when $K$ runs over all convex bodies of a fixed volume.
  This behavior is somehow unexpected and contradicts the limit case $\delta \to 1^-$, which is governed by the Petty projection inequality.</description>

      <title>An improved stability result for Gr\"unbaum's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a hyperplane $H$ cutting a bounded, convex body $K$ through its centroid, Gr\"unbaum proved that
  $$\frac{|K\cap H^+|}{|K|}\geq \left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right)^n,$$where $H^+$ is a half-space of boundary $H$. The inequality is sharp and equality is reached only if $K$ is a cone. Moreover, bodies that almost achieve equality are geometrically close to being cones, as Groemer showed in 2000 by giving his stability estimates for Gr\"unbaum's inequality. In this paper, we improve the exponent in the stability inequality from Groemer's $\frac{1}{2n^2}$ to $\frac{1}{2n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on some notions of surface area for discrete graphs which are closely related to the inverse degree. These notions then naturally lead to associated connectivity measures of graphs and to the definition of a special class of large graphs, called social graphs, that might prove interesting for applications. In addition, we derive spectral estimates involving the surface area and, as a main result, present an upper bound on the second eigenvalue for planar graphs which in some cases improves upon existing bounds from D. A. Spielman and S.-H. Teng, Spectral partitioning works: Planar graphs and finite element meshes, and M. Pl\"umer, Upper eigenvalue bounds for the Kirchhoff Laplacian on embedded metric graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Freedman [arXiv:2301.00295] introduced the idea of packing a maximal number of links into a bounded region subject to geometric constraints, and produced upper bounds on the packing number in some cases, while commenting that these bounds seemed far too large. We show that the smallest of these "extravagantly large" bounds is in fact sharp by constructing, for any link, a packing of exponentially many copies as a function of the available volume. We also produce improved and generalized upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Unweighted Layered Graph Traversal: Passing a Crown via Entropy Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1989, layered graph traversal is a central problem in online algorithms and mobile computing that has been studied for several decades, and which now is essentially resolved in its original formulation. In this paper, we demonstrate that what appears to be an innocuous modification of the problem actually leads to a drastic (exponential) reduction of the competitive ratio. Specifically, we present an algorithm that is $O(\log^2 w)$-competitive for traversing unweighted layered graphs of width $w$. Our algorithm chooses the agent's position simply according to the probability distribution over the current layer that maximizes the sum of entropies of the induced distributions in the preceding layers.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we go over the history of the Fuglede or Spectral Set Conjecture as it has developed over the last 30 years or so. We do not aim to be exhaustive and we do not cover important areas of development such as the results on the problem in classes of finite groups or the version of the problem that focuses on spectral measures instead of sets. The selection of the material has been strongly influenced by personal taste, history and capabilities. We are trying to be more descriptive than detailed and we point out several open questions.</description>
