      <title>Representation Learning for Regime detection in Block Hierarchical Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider financial market regime detection from the perspective of deep representation learning of the causal information geometry underpinning traded asset systems using a hierarchical correlation structure to characterise market evolution. We assess the robustness of three toy models: SPDNet, SPD-NetBN and U-SPDNet whose architectures respect the underlying Riemannian manifold of input block hierarchical SPD correlation matrices. Market phase detection for each model is carried out using three data configurations: randomised JSE Top 60 data, synthetically-generated block hierarchical SPD matrices and block-resampled chronology-preserving JSE Top 60 data. We show that using a singular performance metric is misleading in our financial market investment use cases where deep learning models overfit in learning spatio-temporal correlation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Log Heston Model for Monthly Average VIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model time series of VIX (monthly average) and monthly stock index returns. We use log-Heston model: logarithm of VIX is modeled as an autoregression of order 1. Our main insight is that normalizing monthly stock index returns (dividing them by VIX) makes them much closer to independent identically distributed Gaussian. The resulting model is mean-reverting, and the innovations are non-Gaussian. The combined stochastic volatility model fits well, and captures Pareto-like tails of real-world stock market returns. This works for small and large stock indices, for both price and total returns.</description>

      <title>The VIX as Stochastic Volatility for Corporate Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22498v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic stochastic volatility models assume volatility is unobservable. We use the VIX for consider it observable, and use the Volatility Index: S\&amp;P 500 VIX. This index was designed to measure volatility of S&amp;P 500. We apply it to a different segment: Corporate bond markets. We fit time series models for spreads between corporate and 10-year Treasury bonds. Next, we divide residuals by VIX. Our main idea is such division makes residuals closer to the ideal case of a Gaussian white noise. This is remarkable, since these residuals and VIX come from separate market segments. We conclude with the analysis of long-term behavior of these models.</description>

      <title>Fundamental properties of linear factor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conditional linear factor models in the context of asset pricing panels. Our analysis focuses on conditional means and covariances to characterize the cross-sectional and inter-temporal properties of returns and factors as well as their interrelationships. We also review the conditions outlined in Kozak and Nagel (2024) and show how the conditional mean-variance efficient portfolio of an unbalanced panel can be spanned by low-dimensional factor portfolios, even without assuming invertibility of the conditional covariance matrices. Our analysis provides a comprehensive foundation for the specification and estimation of conditional linear factor models.</description>

      <title>Achilles, Neural Network to Predict the Gold Vs US Dollar Integration with Trading Bot for Automatic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the stock market is a big challenge for the machine learning world. It is known how difficult it is to have accurate and consistent predictions with ML models. Some architectures are able to capture the movement of stocks but almost never are able to be launched to the production world. We present Achilles, with a classical architecture of LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) neural network this model is able to predict the Gold vs USD commodity. With the predictions minute-per-minute of this model we implemented a trading bot to run during 23 days of testing excluding weekends. At the end of the testing period we generated $1623.52 in profit with the methodology used. The results of our method demonstrate Machine Learning can successfully be implemented to predict the Gold vs USD commodity.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Conditional Mean and Covariance for Unbalanced Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric kernel-based estimator of cross-sectional conditional mean and covariance matrices for large unbalanced panels. We show its consistency and provide finite-sample guarantees. In an empirical application, we estimate conditional mean and covariance matrices for a large unbalanced panel of monthly stock excess returns given macroeconomic and firm-specific covariates from 1962 to 2021.The estimator performs well with respect to statistical measures. It is informative for empirical asset pricing, generating conditional mean-variance efficient portfolios with substantial out-of-sample Sharpe ratios far beyond equal-weighted benchmarks.</description>
