      <title>Edge state behavior of interacting Bosons in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the low momentum regime, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model's key characteristics are encapsulated by a Dirac-type Hamiltonian in continuum space, i.e., the localized states emerge at the boundaries. Building on this, we have developed an effective Hamiltonian to model ultra cold interacting Bosons on an SSH like lattice through variational minimization under the mean field approximation. To pinpoint the boundary states, we have developed an algorithm by generalizing the imaginary time propagator, where a initial state evolves under the squared Hamiltonian to converge to the targeted state. This algorithm has broader applicability, enabling the identification of specific eigenstates in various contexts. Furthermore, we draw a parallel to an experimentally physical setup involving a gas of ultra cold Bosons confined to an array of potential wells with alternating depths. By establishing the system's analogy with the SSH system, we apply our algorithm to investigate boundary states in the presence of interaction, demonstrating how these findings align with those of the continuous system.</description>

      <title>Accessing elusive two-dimensional phases of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates by finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates that are tightly trapped along the polarization direction can feature a rich phase diagram. In this paper we show that finite temperature can assist in accessing parts of the phase diagram that otherwise appear hard to realise due to excessively large densities and number of atoms being required. These include honeycomb and stripe phases both in the thermodynamic limit as well as with a finite extent using both variational and numerical calculations. We account for the effect of thermal fluctuations by means of Bogoliubov theory employing the local density approximation. Furthermore, we exhibit real-time evolution simulations leading to such states. We find that finite temperatures can lead to a significant decrease in the necessary particle number and density that might ultimately pave a route for future experimental realisations.</description>

      <title>Microscopy of bosonic charge carriers in staggered magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom is believed to underlie various unresolved phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Quantum simulators based on neutral atoms provide an excellent testbed for investigating such phenomena and resolving their microscopic origins. Up to now, the majority of experimental and theoretical studies has focused on systems with fermionic exchange statistics. Here we expand the existing cold atom toolbox through the use of negative temperature states, enabling us to realize an antiferromagnetic, bosonic $t-J$ model in two spatial dimensions, subject to a strong staggered magnetic field in a quantum gas microscope. Through comparison of the spreading dynamics of a single hole in a N\'eel versus a spin-polarized initial state, we establish the relevance of memory effects resulting from the buildup of strong spin-charge correlations in the dynamics of charge carriers in antiferromagnets. We further numerically predict rich dynamics of pairs of doped holes, which we demonstrate to be bound by a similar memory effect, while their center-of-mass can expand freely. Our work paves the way for the systematic exploration of the effect of antiferromagnetic spin ordering on the properties of individual charge carriers as well as finite doping phases: Our study demonstrates that the staggered field can be used to single out the effect of antiferromagnetism and holds the prospect to prepare low-temperature states in the near future.</description>

      <title>SU($N$) symmetry with ultracold alkali dimers: weak dependence of scattering properties on hyperfine state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of using ultracold alkali diatomic molecules to implement many-body quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry. Experimentally accessible molecules offer large $N$ for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with both attractive and repulsive interactions. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations on pairs of NaK, NaRb and NaCs molecules that are shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields. We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strong interaction effect in synthetic spin-orbit coupling with mixed spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms couples the pseudo-spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two particles contain symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. This mixed spin symmetry has been overlooked and has not been investigated thoroughly. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. Similarly to two-particle systems, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. Also, the emergence of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. In contrast to two-particle systems, the pair correlation of the ground state is analogous to the Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions, and this feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing spontaneously symmetry-broken phases with spin-charge separation through noise correlation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize strongly interacting quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system. By explicit computation, we derive a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our proposed method using the scattering length drive is applicable to a wide range of ultracold atomic systems, and our results establish these as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>
