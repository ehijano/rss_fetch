      <title>Detailed Simulations of Massive Hierarchical Triple Star Systems - Exploring the impact of the stellar physics on the evolutionary pathways of massive hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations estimate that 30% of early B and O-type stars are found in triple systems. So far, the evolution of triple star systems has mainly been modeled using fast stellar codes. Their accuracy decreases with increasing mass, limiting their reliability for predicting the evolutionary pathways of massive triple systems. We coupled Tres, which by default uses Seba (fast stellar code) to Mesa to perform the first simulations of triple systems that combine a triple secular evolutionary code with a detailed, on-the-fly stellar code. After examining the differences between the stellar evolution predicted by the two codes, we simulate the evolution of a set of triple systems and compare their predicted evolutionary pathways. The predicted stellar tracks become increasingly divergent with increasing mass and wind mass loss efficiency. The maximal radial extent, crucial for determining whether the components of the triple systems interact, differ by up to two orders of magnitude between the two stellar codes in the considered mass range. This leads to divergences in the triples evolutionary pathways predicted by mesa and seba. Using mesa instead of seba, the minimum period for avoiding inner mass transfer is reduced by three orders of magnitude. This has important consequences for the formation of GW sources through the triple compact object channel. Our simulations offer new insights into the physics of triple systems, as key processes (mass loss, radial expansion, precession) are treated self-consistently. They indicate that the results of triple systems population synthesis studies must be interpreted cautiously, in particular when the considered masses are outside the range of the grid the fast codes are based on and when significant stellar winds are considered.</description>

      <title>Variable Polarization of WR~31a: Binary Companion or Co-Rotating Interaction Region?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WR 31a (Hen 3-519) is likely a post-luminous blue variable (LBV) star that is evolving to become a classical Wolf-Rayet star. Multicolor (UBVR) photopolarimetric observations of WR 31a were obtained over nine nights in early 2007. The linear polarization data of WR 31a trace a "loop" structure in a Stokes Q-U diagram, which is similar in all four passbands. After mean subtraction, the four loops align to form a single overall pattern. Such loops can be expected to arise from binary systems. We test the binary hypothesis with two models. The data are fit for a strictly circular orbit to derive an orbital period of 16.7 d, requiring a high inclination perspective of $i\sim 80^\circ$. We also consider an elliptical orbit under simplifying assumptions, yielding a match for $i\sim 75^\circ$ with eccentricity $e\sim 0.5$ and a longer orbital period of about 70 d. The prevalence of binarity among massive stars is well-known; the prospect of detecting a binary companion during the post-LBV stage of WR 31a would add to an emerging narrative of diverse interactions between massive multiple components as a function of evolutionary stage. However, if the loop originates because of a co-rotating interaction region (CIR), then the rotation period could be 8.5 d or 17 d. This would give an estimated equatorial rotation speed of 95 or 190 km/s. Either of these is a significant fraction of the estimated critical speed of rotational break-up at 320 km/s (for an Eddington factor of $\Gamma=0$).</description>

      <title>Fe XVIII and Fe XX Forbidden Lines Observed by Solar Orbiter/SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first simultaneous observations of the Fe XVIII 974.86 {\AA} and Fe XX 721.56 {\AA} forbidden lines from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) spectrograph on Solar Orbiter are presented. The lines were observed from the post-flare loops of an M2.5 class solar flare that peaked at 23:49 UT on 2024 March 23. The Fe XX/Fe XVIII ratio is used to derive a temperature space-time map for the flaring period, with values ranging from 8 to 20 MK. The map reveals repeated episodes of heating at the SPICE slit location over a 30 min period. For one location with the brightest emission, the plasma cooled from 10 MK to 8 MK in 5 min which is longer than the expected conductive cooling time of 170 s, suggesting continued background heating during the cooling period. Doppler shifts of between 0 and +10 km/s were obtained with precisions of 1-4 km/s, but the accuracies are lower due to uncertainties over the absolute wavelength calibration hence we can not conclude there are plasma flows in the flare loops. The widths of the two lines were found to be close to the instrumental widths with no evidence of non-thermal broadening, although this result is limited by the instrument resolution. The Fe XVIII and Fe XX lines have high signal-to-noise with only a 5 s exposure time, demonstrating that the lines will be valuable for high-cadence flare studies with SPICE.</description>

      <title>Some Questions and Challenges in Measurements of Solar Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Huairou Solar Observing Station of the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been in operation since 1987. Successful observations of the solar vector magnetic field have been conducted during its operation. Based on the achievements at Huairou, we analyze the methods of observing the solar magnetic field, including discussions of the approximation of the transfer theory of the solar magnetic field in the atmosphere, wide field of view polarized observation, and some questions on the inversion of solar magnetic field data. We also present relevant challenges for further research.</description>

      <title>Multiple generation star formation in Cepheus Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia DR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the number identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria, ASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15 to 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.</description>

      <title>Modeling Metric Gyrosynchrotron Radio Emission From the Quiet Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio emission of the quiet Sun in the metric and decametric bands has not been well studied historically due to limitations of existing instruments. It is nominally dominated by thermal brehmsstrahlung of the solar corona, but may also include significant gyrosynchrotron emission, usually assumed to be weak under quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the expected gyrosynchrotron contribution to solar radio emission in the lowest radio frequencies observable by ground instruments, for different regions of the low and middle corona. We approximate the coronal conditions by a synoptic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The thermal emission is estimated from a forward model based on the simulated corona. We calculate the expected gyrosynchrotron emission with the Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes framework by Fleishman &amp; Kuznetsov (2010). The model emissions of different coronal regions are compared with quiet-time observations between 20-90 MHz by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope. The contribution of gyrosynchrotron radiation to low frequency solar radio emission may shed light on effects such as the hitherto unexplained brightness variation observed in decametric coronal hole emission, and help constrain measurements of the coronal magnetic fields. It can also improve our understanding of electron populations in the middle corona and their relation to the formation of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Free-floating Planet Mass Function with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planets comprise one of the most enigmatic populations of exoplanets in the Galaxy. Though ground-based observations point to a large abundance of these worlds, little is known about their origins and demographics. In the coming years, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to detect several hundred free-floating planets, providing the first opportunity to characterize these worlds at the population level. We present a first study of Roman's prospects for reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through population-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true underlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will be able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of magnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth. When applied to Roman's observations, the methodology we present herein will be capable of discriminating between different hypothesized mass distributions at high statistical significance, opening a new window into the origins of these rogue worlds.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating $\mathcal{C}$-stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic self-gravitating fluids are computed using the extended Hartle structure equations, including anisotropic effects, derived in our previous paper. We focus on the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-star, whose anisotropic pressure follows a fully covariant equation of state (EoS), while a standard polytrope describes the radial pressure. We determine surface and integral properties, such as the moment of inertia, mass change, mass quadrupole moment, and ellipticity. Notably, for certain values of the compactness parameter, highly anisotropic $\mathcal{C}$-stars exhibit a prolate shape rather than the typical oblate form, an intriguing behavior also observed in other anisotropic systems like Bowers-Liang spheres and stars governed by a quasi-local EoS. Although the $\mathcal{C}$-stars considered in this study are limited by stability criteria and cannot sustain compactness beyond $M/R\approx0.38$, we found indications that certain rotational perturbations exhibit similarities to those observed in other ultracompact systems approaching the black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Reduced solar quadrupole moment compensates for lack of asteroids in long-term solar system integrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art long-term solar system integrations include several second order effects such as the Sun's quadrupole moment J2 and a contribution from asteroids (plus the Moon and general relativity). We recently showed that including 10 asteroids and a reduced J2 in our astronomical solutions provides the best match with geologic data to -58 Myr. However, the rationale for the reduced J2 remained ambiguous and may suggest that parameters for long-term integrations compatible with geologic observations are not fully compatible with our knowledge of the current solar system (specifically J2). Here we show that a reduced J2 compensates for a diminished asteroid population in long-term solar system integrations, which may appear surprising. We present an analysis and offer a mechanism for the long-term compensating effects of J2 and asteroid mass in the solar system (not planetary systems in general). Our analysis suggests that "differential effects" on specific secular frequencies involved in resonant terms (i.e., (g4-g3) and (s4-s3)), are critical in the long term, rather than short-term effects on the orbital elements of individual planetary orbits across the board. Also, our results indicate that if long-term intergrations including the full asteroid population were computationally feasible, a J2 value (within errors) compatible with our current knowledge of the solar system could be used. Attempts to improve the long-term accuracy of astronomical solutions by, e.g., tinkering with initial conditions using current/future astronomical observations are futile unless asteroid deficiencies in the solar system model are addressed.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Radii from Laboratory Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our present knowledge of the nuclear equation of state is briefly reviewed in this article intended for a wider readership. Particular emphasis is given to the asymmetric-matter equation of state required for modeling neutron stars, neutron-star mergers, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Recent analyses based on combining information obtained from nuclear theory, heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations confine the obtained radii of the canonical 1.4-solar-mass neutron star to values between 12 km and 13 km. The remaining uncertainty is primarily related to missing information in the density interval between nuclear saturation density and about twice that value which, however, is accessible with laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) has been a long-standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low-mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using data from both the Montreal White Dwarf Database and a 20 pc volume-limited sample from Gaia DR2, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarf forms. Crystallization dynamos, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with the progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing a field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints, with mergers best able to explain the high mass, strongly magnetized young MWDs. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the community studying the effect of ultraviolet radiation environment, predominantly set by OB stars, on protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation. This is important because a significant fraction of planetary systems, potentially including our own, formed in close proximity to OB stars. This is a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of observations across many regions recently obtained or recently scheduled. In this paper, stimulated by a series of workshops on the topic, we take stock of the current and upcoming observations. We discuss how the community can build on this recent success with future observations to make progress in answering the big questions of the field, with the broad goal of disentangling how external photoevaporation contributes to shaping the observed (exo)planet population. Both existing and future instruments offer numerous opportunities to make progress towards this goal.</description>

      <title>The spectra of solar magnetic energy and helicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies have used magnetic energy and helicity spectra, the latter computed using the two-scale method, to search for signatures of mean-field dynamos. In this study, we compare cotemporal HMI and SOLIS magnetograms to illustrate the instrument-dependence of even qualitative features of the energy and helicity spectra. Around the minimum between solar cycles 24 and 25, we find that the magnetic energy spectrum computed from HMI observations exhibits two distinct peaks. One of these peaks is only present near the cycle minimum, and corresponds to large-scale magnetic fields at high latitudes. Nevertheless, such magnetic fields are not present in contemporaneous synoptic vector magnetograms from SOLIS. Further, even when magnetograms from both the instruments are apodized, the helicity spectra calculated using the two-scale method disagree (on both the sign and the value of the fractional helicity). This suggests that currently available synoptic magnetograms are not reliable enough for such studies.</description>

      <title>Abundance Measurements of the Metal-poor M subdwarf LHS 174 Using High-resolution Optical Spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Metal-poor M subdwarfs are among the oldest stellar populations and carry valuable information about the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. The measurements of chemical abundances of these stars therefore provide essential insights into the nucleosynthesis in the early stages of the Galaxy's formation. We present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of a nearby metal-poor M subdwarf, LHS 174 from its high-resolution optical spectrum, and apply our previously developed spectral fitting code, \texttt{AutoSpecFit}, to measure the abundances of five elements:[O/H]=$-$0.519$\pm$0.081, [Ca/H]=$-$0.753$\pm$0.177, [Ti/H]=$-$0.711$\pm$0.144, [V/H]=$-$1.026$\pm$0.077, and [Fe/H]=$-$1.170$\pm$0.135. We compare the abundances of O, Ti, and Fe derived from this work and those from previous studies and demonstrate the observed data is clearly better matched with the synthetic model generated based on our abundances than those from the other analyses. The accuracy of inferred stellar abundances strongly depends on the accuracy of physical parameters, which motivates us to develop a reliable technique to determine the parameters of low-mass M dwarfs more accurately ever than before and infer abundances with smaller uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>

Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational domain and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs in the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in nonshearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>

      <title>Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities</title>

Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases with the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.</description>

      <title>An MHD Simulation of the Possible Modulations of Stellar CMEs Radio Observations by an Exoplanetary Magnetosphere</title>

Abstract: Type II radio bursts are the indicator of adverse space weather in a stellar system. These radio bursts are the consequence of shock wave acceleration due to the coronal mass ejection (CME). In this study, we conduct a series of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of CME-driven star-planet systems to investigate how close-in exoplanets modulate radio burst characteristics. We use a model for the stellar wind with a close-in exoplanet, and a CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to generate synthetic radio burst images from our MHD simulations. We find that radio burst like phenomena is most likely to be observed for moderately active solar like stars and close-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence on the nature of radio burst spectrum. We find that when the exoplanet's magnetic field is relatively weak, its magnetosphere compresses the CME plasma, increasing local density and shifting the radio emission to higher frequencies. Conversely, a strong planetary magnetic field results in a large magnetosphere that prevents effective CME-shock development, producing weaker radio emission concentrated at lower frequencies, particularly at the flanks of the CME. For highly active solar-like stars, strong overlying stellar magnetic fields suppress the CME shock, greatly diminishing radio burst visibility. For HD 189733 (moderate stellar field), only intensity difference is visible when the CME arrives the planet. We also do not find significant modulation in the radio emission by a close-in exoplanet system when the stellar magnetic field is complex. In summary, our findings highlight that the nature of the radio burst spectrum is strongly dependent on both the topology of the stellar magnetic field and the magnetic strength of close-in exoplanets.</description>
