      <title>L2 Ethernet Switch VLSI Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethernet switches are foundational to the global internet infrastructure. These devices route packets of data on a local area network between source addresses to destination media access control addresses. On the L2 layer of the Open Systems Interconnections model, Ethernet switches take in digitized data from a Media Independent Interface and send it to the corresponding output port for the destination address. Switches need to handle parallel input and output streams from each port, prioritizing throughput, efficiency, and packet integrity. Due to the confidential nature of the networking device industry, there do not exist many open source implementations of switching fabrics. We propose an open source design for an L2 Ethernet switch along with the power, performance, and area tradeoffs for architecture decisions.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Interface for Firewall Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and prototype implementation of a natural language interface for configuring enterprise firewalls. The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model. The paper describes the architecture, implementation, and test methodology on synthetic network context datasets and discusses how this approach can evolve into a scalable auditable and human centered workflow for firewall policy management.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Digital Twin of Distributed Link Scheduling for Contention-Aware Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many routing and flow optimization problems in wired networks can be solved efficiently using minimum cost flow formulations. However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.</description>

      <title>IoTEdu: Access Control, Detection, and Automatic Incident Response in Academic IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing presence of IoT devices in academic environments has increased operational complexity and exposed security weaknesses, especially in academic institutions without unified policies for registration, monitoring, and incident response involving IoT. This work presents IoTEdu, an integrated platform that combines access control, incident detection, and automatic blocking of IoT devices. The solution was evaluated in a controlled environment with simulated attacks, achieving an average time of 28.6 seconds between detection and blocking. The results show a reduction in manual intervention, standardization of responses, and unification of the processes of registration, monitoring, and incident response.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Security for Private Networks: Real-World Evaluation of WireGuard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores WireGuard as a lightweight alternative to IPsec for securing the user plane as well as the control plane in an industrial Open RAN deployment at the Adtran Terafactory in Meiningen. We focus on a realistic scenario where external vendors access their hardware in our 5G factory network, posing recurrent security risks from untrusted gNBs and intermediate network elements. Unlike prior studies limited to lab setups, we implement a complete proof-of-concept in a factory environment and compare WireGuard with IPsec under industrial traffic conditions. Our approach successfully protects user data (N3 interface) against untrusted gNBs and man-in-the-middle attacks while enabling control plane (N2 interface) authentication between the access and mobility management functions (AMF) and gNB. Performance measurements show that WireGuard adds minimal overhead in throughput, latency, and Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage, achieving performance comparable to IPsec. These findings demonstrate that WireGuard offers competitive performance with significantly reduced configuration complexity, making it a strong candidate for broader adoption in O-RAN, providing a unified, lightweight security layer across multiple interfaces and components.</description>

      <title>LibIQ: Toward Real-Time Spectrum Classification in O-RAN dApps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical and Usable In-network Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-network machine learning enables real-time classification directly on network hardware, offering consistently low inference latency. However, current solutions are limited by strict hardware constraints, scarce on-device resources, and poor usability, making them impractical for ML developers and cloud operators. To this end, we propose ACORN, an end-to-end system that automates the distributed deployment of practical machine learning models across the network. ACORN provides a fully automated pipeline that loads and deploys Python ML models on network devices using an optimized deployment plan from an ILP planner. To support larger models under hardware constraints and allow runtime programmability, ACORN adopts a novel data plane representation for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models. We implement ACORN prototype in P4 and run it on real programmable hardware. Our evaluation shows ACORN can deploy classification ML models with 2-4x more features than state-of-the-art solutions, while imposing negligible overhead on network performance and traffic. We will make our data plane program, model translator, optimizer, and all related scripts publicly available.</description>

      <title>Toward Intelligent and Secure Cloud: Large Language Model Empowered Proactive Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of cloud computing technologies and the increasing number of cloud applications have provided numerous benefits in our daily lives. However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks such as Denial of Service (DoS). Recent advancements in the large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful capabilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel defense architecture that proactively mitigates various DoS threats in cloud networks. LLM-PD can efficiently make decisions through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically create and deploy actionable defense mechanisms. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. Our case study on three distinct DoS attacks demonstrates its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency when compared with other existing methods.</description>
