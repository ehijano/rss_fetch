      <title>A novel section-section potential for short-range interactions between plane beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel formulation for the interaction potential between deformable fibers due to short-range fields arising from intermolecular forces. The formulation improves the existing section-section interaction potential law for in-plane beams by considering an offset between interacting cross sections. The new law is asymptotically consistent, which is particularly beneficial for computationally demanding scenarios involving short-range interactions like van der Waals and steric forces. The formulation is implemented within a framework of rotation-free Bernoulli-Euler beams utilizing the isogeometric paradigm. The improved accuracy of the novel law is confirmed through thorough numerical studies. We apply the developed formulation to investigate the complex behavior observed during peeling and pull-off of elastic fibers interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Battery Degradation Diagnostics: A Comparison of State-of-the-Art Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the health of lithium-ion batteries' internal components as they age is crucial for optimizing cell design and usage control strategies. However, quantifying component-level degradation typically involves aging many cells and destructively analyzing them throughout the aging test, limiting the scope of quantifiable degradation to the test conditions and duration. Fortunately, recent advances in physics-informed machine learning (PIML) for modeling and predicting the battery state of health demonstrate the feasibility of building models to predict the long-term degradation of a lithium-ion battery cell's major components using only short-term aging test data by leveraging physics. In this paper, we present four approaches for building physics-informed machine learning models and comprehensively compare them, considering accuracy, complexity, ease-of-implementation, and their ability to extrapolate to untested conditions. We delve into the details of each physics-informed machine learning method, providing insights specific to implementing them on small battery aging datasets. Our study utilizes long-term cycle aging data from 24 implantable-grade lithium-ion cells subjected to varying temperatures and C-rates over four years. This paper aims to facilitate the selection of an appropriate physics-informed machine learning method for predicting long-term degradation in lithium-ion batteries, using short-term aging data while also providing insights about when to choose which method for general predictive purposes.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Bayesian Optimization with Pre-trained Transformers for Constrained Engineering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a foundational strategy in the field of engineering design optimization for efficiently handling black-box functions with many constraints and expensive evaluations. This paper introduces a fast and accurate BO framework that leverages Pre-trained Transformers for Bayesian Optimization (PFN4sBO) to address constrained optimization problems in engineering. Unlike traditional BO methods that rely heavily on Gaussian Processes (GPs), our approach utilizes Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs), a type of pre-trained transformer, to infer constraints and optimal solutions without requiring any iterative retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFN-based BO through a comprehensive benchmark consisting of fifteen test problems, encompassing synthetic, structural, and engineering design challenges. Our findings reveal that PFN-based BO significantly outperforms Constrained Expected Improvement and Penalty-based GP methods by an order of magnitude in speed while also outperforming them in accuracy in identifying feasible, optimal solutions. This work showcases the potential of integrating machine learning with optimization techniques in solving complex engineering challenges, heralding a significant leap forward for optimization methodologies, opening up the path to using PFN-based BO to solve other challenging problems, such as enabling user-guided interactive BO, adaptive experiment design, or multi-objective design optimization. Additionally, we establish a benchmark for evaluating BO algorithms in engineering design, offering a robust platform for future research and development in the field. This benchmark framework for evaluating new BO algorithms in engineering design will be published at https://github.com/rosenyu304/BOEngineeringBenchmark.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian operator inference enhanced with structure-preserving machine learning for nonintrusive model reduction of mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex mechanical systems often exhibit strongly nonlinear behavior due to the presence of nonlinearities in the energy dissipation mechanisms, material constitutive relationships, or geometric/connectivity mechanics. Numerical modeling of these systems leads to nonlinear full-order models that possess an underlying Lagrangian structure. This work proposes a Lagrangian operator inference method enhanced with structure-preserving machine learning to learn nonlinear reduced-order models (ROMs) of nonlinear mechanical systems. This two-step approach first learns the best-fit linear Lagrangian ROM via Lagrangian operator inference and then presents a structure-preserving machine learning method to learn nonlinearities in the reduced space. The proposed approach can learn a structure-preserving nonlinear ROM purely from data, unlike the existing operator inference approaches that require knowledge about the mathematical form of nonlinear terms. From a machine learning perspective, it accelerates the training of the structure-preserving neural network by providing an informed prior, and it reduces the computational cost of the network training by operating on the reduced space. The method is first demonstrated on two simulated examples: a conservative nonlinear rod model and a two-dimensional nonlinear membrane with nonlinear internal damping. Finally, the method is demonstrated on an experimental dataset consisting of digital image correlation measurements taken from a lap-joint beam structure from which a predictive model is learned that captures amplitude-dependent frequency and damping characteristics accurately. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields generalizable nonlinear ROMs that exhibit bounded energy error, capture the nonlinear characteristics reliably, and provide accurate long-time predictions outside the training data regime.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for the Kalman filter using block encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer significant speed-ups over their classical counterparts in various applications. In this paper, we develop quantum algorithms for the Kalman filter widely used in classical control engineering using the block encoding method. The entire calculation process is achieved by performing matrix operations on Hamiltonians based on the block encoding framework, including addition, multiplication, and inversion, which can be completed in a unified framework compared to previous quantum algorithms for solving control problems. We demonstrate that the quantum algorithm exponentially accelerates the computation of the Kalman filter compared to traditional methods. The time complexity can be reduced from $O(n^3)$ to $O(\kappa poly\log(n/\epsilon)\log(1/\epsilon'))$, where $n$ represents the matrix dimension, $\kappa$ denotes the condition number for the matrix to be inverted, $\epsilon$ indicates desired precision in block encoding, $\epsilon'$ signifies desired precision in matrix inversion. This paper provides a comprehensive quantum solution for implementing the Kalman filter and serves as an attempt to broaden the scope of quantum computation applications. Finally, we present an illustrative example implemented in Qiskit (a Python-based open-source toolkit) as a proof-of-concept.</description>

      <title>SilverSight: A Multi-Task Chinese Financial Large Language Model Based on Adaptive Semantic Space Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied across various specialized fields, leveraging their extensive knowledge to empower a multitude of scenarios within these domains. However, each field encompasses a variety of specific tasks that require learning, and the diverse, heterogeneous data across these domains can lead to conflicts during model task transfer. In response to this challenge, our study introduces an Adaptive Semantic Space Learning (ASSL) framework, which utilizes the adaptive reorganization of data distributions within the semantic space to enhance the performance and selection efficacy of multi-expert models. Utilizing this framework, we trained a financial multi-task LLM named "SilverSight". Our research findings demonstrate that our framework can achieve results close to those obtained with full data training using only 10% of the data, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperdrive is a protocol designed to facilitate the trading of fixed and variable rate assets. The protocol's unique pricing model consolidates liquidity into a single pool which addresses the challenges of fragmented liquidity across terms, eliminates the need for rollovers, and allows terms to be issued on demand. Its design meaningfully improves trading efficiency, liquidity provisioning, and user experience over existing fixed and variable rate protocol models.</description>

      <title>Bathymetry reconstruction from experimental data using PDE-constrained optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the bottom topography, also called bathymetry, of rivers, seas or the ocean is important for many areas of maritime science and civil engineering. While direct measurements are possible, they are time consuming and expensive. Therefore, many approaches have been proposed how to infer the bathymetry from measurements of surface waves. Mathematically, this is an inverse problem where an unknown system state needs to be reconstructed from observations with a suitable model for the flow as constraint. In many cases, the shallow water equations can be used to describe the flow. While theoretical studies of the efficacy of such a PDE-constrained optimisation approach for bathymetry reconstruction exist, there seem to be few publications that study its application to data obtained from real-world measurements. This paper shows that the approach can, at least qualitatively, reconstruct a Gaussian-shaped bathymetry in a wave flume from measurements of the water height at up to three points. Achieved normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) are in line with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Non-Atomic Arbitrage in Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence of maximal extractable value (MEV) in the Ethereum ecosystem has led to a characterization of the latter as a dark forest. Studies of MEV have thus far largely been restricted to purely on-chain MEV, i.e., sandwich attacks, cyclic arbitrage, and liquidations. In this work, we shed light on the prevalence of non-atomic arbitrage on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, non-atomic arbitrage exploits price differences between DEXes on the Ethereum blockchain as well as exchanges outside the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., centralized exchanges or DEXes on other blockchains). Thus, non-atomic arbitrage is a type of MEV that involves actions on and off the Ethereum blockchain.
  In our study of non-atomic arbitrage, we uncover that more than a fourth of the volume on Ethereum's biggest five DEXes from the merge until 31 October 2023 can likely be attributed to this type of MEV. We further highlight that only eleven searchers are responsible for more than 80% of the identified non-atomic arbitrage volume sitting at a staggering $132 billion and draw a connection between the centralization of the block construction market and non-atomic arbitrage. Finally, we discuss the security implications of these high-value transactions that account for more than 10% of Ethereum's total block value and outline possible mitigations.</description>

      <title>Modal-adaptive Knowledge-enhanced Graph-based Financial Prediction from Monetary Policy Conference Calls with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial prediction from Monetary Policy Conference (MPC) calls is a new yet challenging task, which targets at predicting the price movement and volatility for specific financial assets by analyzing multimodal information including text, video, and audio. Although the existing work has achieved great success using cross-modal transformer blocks, it overlooks the potential external financial knowledge, the varying contributions of different modalities to financial prediction, as well as the innate relations among different financial assets. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Modal-Adaptive kNowledge-enhAnced Graph-basEd financial pRediction scheme, named MANAGER. Specifically, MANAGER resorts to FinDKG to obtain the external related knowledge for the input text. Meanwhile, MANAGER adopts BEiT-3 and Hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT) to extract the video and audio features, respectively. Thereafter, MANAGER introduces a novel knowledge-enhanced cross-modal graph that fully characterizes the semantic relations among text, external knowledge, video and audio, to adaptively utilize the information in different modalities, with ChatGLM2 as the backbone. Extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset Monopoly verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.</description>

      <title>Economical-Epidemiological Analysis of the Coffee Trees Rust Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coffee leaf rust is a prevalent botanical disease that causes a worldwide reduction in coffee supply and its quality, leading to immense economic losses. While several pandemic intervention policies (PIPs) for tackling this rust pandemic are commercially available, they seem to provide only partial epidemiological relief for farmers. In this work, we develop a high-resolution economical-epidemiological model that captures the rust pandemic's spread in coffee tree farms and its associated economic impact. Through extensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly of small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the world, our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any profit without directly tackling the rust pandemic. Furthermore, even in the hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological state and the weather in advance, any rust pandemic-related efforts can only amount to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case, any rust pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses, indicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are anticipated.</description>

      <title>DoubleAdapt: A Meta-learning Approach to Incremental Learning for Stock Trend Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stock trend forecasting is a fundamental task of quantitative investment where precise predictions of price trends are indispensable. As an online service, stock data continuously arrive over time. It is practical and efficient to incrementally update the forecast model with the latest data which may reveal some new patterns recurring in the future stock market. However, incremental learning for stock trend forecasting still remains under-explored due to the challenge of distribution shifts (a.k.a. concept drifts). With the stock market dynamically evolving, the distribution of future data can slightly or significantly differ from incremental data, hindering the effectiveness of incremental updates. To address this challenge, we propose DoubleAdapt, an end-to-end framework with two adapters, which can effectively adapt the data and the model to mitigate the effects of distribution shifts. Our key insight is to automatically learn how to adapt stock data into a locally stationary distribution in favor of profitable updates. Complemented by data adaptation, we can confidently adapt the model parameters under mitigated distribution shifts. We cast each incremental learning task as a meta-learning task and automatically optimize the adapters for desirable data adaptation and parameter initialization. Experiments on real-world stock datasets demonstrate that DoubleAdapt achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance and shows considerable efficiency.</description>
