      <title>Micrometeoroid Impacts: Dual Pathways for Iron Reduction and Oxidation on Lunar and Asteroidal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) is a key indicator of space weathering on the lunar surface, primarily attributed to solar wind irradiation and micrometeoroid impacts. Recent discoveries of hematite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ ), a highly oxidized form of iron, in the lunar polar regions challenge the prevailing understanding of the Moon's reducing environment. This study, using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid impacts on fayalite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{SiO}_4$ ), investigates the atomistic mechanisms leading to both reduced and oxidized iron species. Our simulations reveals that the high-temperature and pressure conditions at the impact crater surface produces a reduced iron environment while providing a transient oxygen-rich environment in the expanding plume. Our findings bridge previously disparate observations-linking impact-driven $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ formation to the puzzling presence of oxidized iron phases on the Moon, completing the observed strong dichotomous distribution of hematite between the nearside and farside of the Moon. These findings highlight that micrometeoroid impacts, by simultaneously generating spatially distinct redox environments, provide a formation mechanism that reconciles the ubiquitous identification of nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) in returned lunar samples with $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ signatures detected by remote sensing. This underscores the dynamic nature of space weathering processes. For a more nuanced understanding of regolith evolution, we should also consider the presence of different generations or types of $\mathrm{npFe}{ }^0$, such as those formed from solar wind reduction versus impact disproportionation.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability with foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the behaviour of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in the presence of a foam. Such a problem may be relevant, for example, to some inertial confinement fusion (ICF) scenarios such as foams within the capsule or lining the inner hohlraum wall. The foam displays 3 different phases: by order of increasing stress, it is first elastic, then plastic, and then fractures. Only the elastic and plastic phases can be subject to a linear analysis of the instability. The growth rate is analytically computed in these 2 phases, in terms of the micro-structure of the foam. In the first, elastic, phase, the RTI can be stabilized for some wavelengths. In this elastic phase, a homogenous foam model overestimates the growth because it ignores the elastic nature of the foam. Although this result is derived for a simplified foam model, it is likely valid for most of them. Besides the ICF context considered here, our results could be relevant for many fields of science.</description>

      <title>A Norwegian Approach to Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive geoscientific downscaling model strategy is presented outlining an approach that has evolved over the last 20 years, together with an explanation for its development, its technical aspects, and evaluation scheme. This effort has resulted in an open-source and free R-based tool, 'esd', for the benefit of sharing and improving the reproducibility of the downscaling results. Furthermore, a set of new metrics was developed as an integral part of the downscaling approach which assesses model performance with an emphasis on regional information for society (RifS). These metrics involve novel ways of comparing model results with observational data and have been developed for downscaling large multi-model global climate model ensembles. This paper presents for the first time an overview of the comprehensive framework adopted by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute for downscaling aimed at supporting climate change adaptation. A literature search suggests that this comprehensive downscaling strategy and evaluation scheme are not widely used within the downscaling community. In addition, this strategy involves a new convention for storing large datasets of ensemble results that provides fast access to information and drastically saves data volume.</description>
