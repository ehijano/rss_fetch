      <title>Pricing Multi-strike Quanto Call Options on Multiple Assets with Stochastic Volatility, Correlation, and Exchange Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quanto options allow the buyer to exchange the foreign currency payoff into the domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate. We investigate quanto options with multiple underlying assets valued in different foreign currencies each with a different strike price in the payoff function. We carry out a comparative performance analysis of different stochastic volatility (SV), stochastic correlation (SC), and stochastic exchange rate (SER) models to determine the best combination of these models for Monte Carlo (MC) simulation pricing. In addition, we test the performance of all model variants with constant correlation as a benchmark. We find that a combination of GARCH-Jump SV, Weibull SC, and Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) SER performs best. In addition, we analyze different discretization schemes and their results. In our simulations, the Milstein scheme yields the best balance between execution times and lower standard deviations of price estimates. Furthermore, we find that incorporating mean reversion into stochastic correlation and stochastic FX rate modeling is beneficial for MC simulation pricing. We improve the accuracy of our simulations by implementing antithetic variates variance reduction. Finally, we derive the correlation risk parameters Cora and Gora in our framework so that correlation hedging of quanto options can be performed.</description>

      <title>Analytical Formula for Fractional-Order Conditional Moments of Nonlinear Drift CEV Process with Regime Switching: Hybrid Approach with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an analytical formula for the fractional-order conditional moments of nonlinear drift constant elasticity of variance (NLD-CEV) processes under regime switching, governed by continuous-time finite-state irreducible Markov chains. By employing a hybrid system approach, we derive exact closed-form expressions for these moments across arbitrary fractional orders and regime states, thereby enhancing the analytical tractability of NLD-CEV models under stochastic regimes. Our methodology hinges on formulating and solving a complex system of interconnected partial differential equations derived from the Feynman-Kac formula for switching diffusions. To illustrate the practical relevance of our approach, Monte Carlo simulations for process with Markovian switching are applied to validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the analytical formulas. Furthermore, we apply our findings for the valuation of financial derivatives within a dynamic nonlinear mean-reverting regime-switching framework, which demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods. This work offers substantial contributions to financial modeling and derivative pricing by providing a robust tool for practitioners and researchers who are dealing with complex stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>A cross-border market model with limited transmission capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a cross-border market model for two countries based on a continuous trading mechanism, in which the transmission capacities that enable transactions between market participants from different countries are limited. Our market model can be described by a regime-switching process alternating between active and inactive regimes, in which cross-border trading is possible respectively prohibited. Starting from a reduced-form representation of the two national limit order books, we derive a high-frequency approximation of the microscopic model, assuming that the size of an individual order converges to zero while the order arrival rate tends to infinity. If transmission capacities are available, the limiting dynamics are as follows: the queue size processes at the top of the two limit order books follow a four-dimensional linear Brownian motion in the positive orthant with oblique reflection at the axes. Each time the two best ask queues or the two best bid queues simultaneously hit zero, the queue size process is reinitialized. The capacity process can be described as a linear combination of local times and is hence of finite variation. The analytic tractability of the limiting dynamics allows us to compute key quantities of interest.</description>
