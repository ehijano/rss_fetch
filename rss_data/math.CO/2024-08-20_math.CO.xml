      <title>A Novel Approach to Counting Perfect Matchings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a new perspective to count perfect matchings of a given graph. This idea is motivated by a construction on the relative cohomology group of surfaces. As an application of our theory, we reprove the celebrated Aztec Diamond theorem, and show how alternating sign matrices naturally arises through this framework.</description>

Abstract: In 1750, Gabriel Cramer famously stated, without proof, his eponymous rule for solving a system of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns. We give a purely combinatorial, and purely self-contained, proof of this old chestnut, still useful after all these years.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Dice Relabeling using Cyclotomic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the exploration of a question of dice relabeling posed by Gallian and Rusin: Given $n$ dice, each labeled 1 through $m$, how many ways are there to relabel the dice without changing the frequencies of the possible sums? We answer this question in the case where $n = 2$ and $m$ is a product of three prime numbers. We also explore more general questions. We find a method for decomposing two $m$-sided dice into two dice of different sizes and give some preliminary results on relabeling two dice of different sizes. Finally, we refine a result of the aforementioned authors in the case where m is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Completing the solution of the directed Oberwolfach problem with two tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the last outstanding case of the directed Oberwolfach problem with two tables of different lengths. Specifically, we show that the complete symmetric directed graph $K^*_n$ admits a decomposition into spanning subdigraphs comprised of two vertex-disjoint directed cycles of length $t_1$ and $t_2$, respectively, where $t_1\in \{4,6\}$, $t_2$ is even, and $t_1+t_2\geqslant 14$. In conjunction with recent results of Kadri and \v{S}ajna, this gives a complete solution to the directed Oberwolfach problem with two tables of different lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the bodyguard problem for graphs. This is a variation of Surrounding Cops and Robber but, in this model, a smallest possible group of bodyguards must surround the president and then maintain this protection indefinitely. We investigate some elementary bounds, then solve this problem for the infinite graph families of complete graphs, wheels, trees, cycles, complete multipartite graphs, and two-dimensional grids. We also examine the problem in more general Cartesian, strong, and lexicographic products.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizing Parallel Chip-Firing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2010, Kominers and Kominers proved that any parallel chip-firing game on $G(V,\,E)$ with $|\sigma|\geq 4|E|-|V|$ chips stabilizes. Recently, Bu, Choi, and Xu made the bound exact: all games with $|\sigma|&lt; |E|$ chips or $|\sigma|&gt; 3|E|-|V|$ chips stabilize. In this paper, we prove that all parallel chip-firing games with $2|E|-|V|&lt; |\sigma|&lt; 2|E|$ have period $T\neq 3,\,4$. In fact, this is exactly the range of $|\sigma|$ for which all games are non-stabilizing. We conjecture that all parallel chip-firing games with $2|E|-|V|&lt; |\sigma|&lt;2|E|$ have $T=2$. This conjecture has been proven for trees by Bu, Choi, and Xu, cycles by Dall'asta, and complete graphs by Levine. We extend Levine's method of conjugate configurations to prove the conjecture on complete bipartite graphs $K_{a,a}$.</description>

      <title>Decorated square paths at q=-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valley Delta square conjecture states that the symmetric function $\frac{[n-k]_q}{[n]_q}\Delta_{e_{n-k}}\omega(p_n)$ can be expressed as the enumerator of a certain class of decorated square paths with respect to the bistatistic (dinv,area). Inspired by recent positivity results of Corteel, Josuat-Verg\`{e}s, and Vanden Wyngaerd, we study the evaluation of this enumerator at $q=-1$. By considering a cyclic group action on the decorated square paths which we call cutting and pasting, we show that $\left.\left\langle \frac{[n-k]_q}{[n]_q}\Delta_{e_{n-k}}\omega(p_n), h_1^n\right\rangle\right|_{q=-1}$ is $0$ whenever $n-k$ is even, and is a positive polynomial related to the Euler numbers when $n-k$ is odd. We also show that the combinatorics of this enumerator is closely connected to that of the Dyck path enumerator for $\langle\Delta_{e_{n-k-1}}'e_n,h_1^n\rangle$ considered by Corteel-Josuat Verg\`{e}s-Vanden Wyngaerd.</description>

      <title>Towards an edge-coloured Corr\'adi--Hajnal theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Corr\'adi and Hajnal states that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $n\in 3\mathbb{N}$ and $\delta(G) \ge 2n/3$ contains a perfect triangle-tiling, i.e.,\ a spanning set of vertex-disjoint triangles. We explore a generalisation of this result to edge-coloured graphs. Let $G$ be an edge-coloured graph on $n$ vertices. The minimum colour degree $\delta^c(G)$ of $G$ is the largest integer $k$ such that, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, there are at least $k$ distinct colours on edges incident to $v$. We show that if $\delta^c(G) \ge (5/6 + \varepsilon) n$, then $G$ has a spanning set of vertex-disjoint rainbow triangles. On the other hand, we find an example showing the bound should be at least $5n/7$. We also discuss a related tiling problems on digraphs, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Diameter two orientability of mixed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1967, Katona and Szemer\'{e}di showed that no undirected graph with $n$ vertices and fewer than $\frac{n}{2}\log_2\frac{n}{2}$ edges admits an orientation of diameter two. In 1978, Chv\'atal and Thomassen revealed the complexity of determining whether an undirected graph can be oriented to achieve a diameter of two, proving it to be NP-complete. This breakthrough has sparked ongoing interest in identifying sufficient conditions for graphs to be oriented with the smallest possible diameter of two -- critical for optimizing communication and network flow in larger structures. In 2019, Czabarka, Dankelmann, and Sz\'ekely significantly advanced this field by establishing that the minimum degree threshold for achieving such an orientation in undirected graphs of order $n$ is $\frac{n}{2} + \Theta(\ln n)$. In this paper, we extend this foundational result by determining the minimum degree threshold necessary for realizing an orientation with diameter two in mixed graphs, which contain both undirected and directed edges. Mixed graphs offer a versatile framework, representing an intermediate stage in the orientation process, making our findings a substantial generalization of previous results.</description>

      <title>Inverse model for network construction: ({\delta}(G), I' (G)) -&gt; G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isolated toughness variant is a salient parameter for measuring the vulnerability of networks, which is inherently related to fractional factors (used to characterize the feasibility of data transmission). The combination of minimum degree and the corresponding tight bound of isolated toughness variant for fractional factors provide reference standards for network construction. However, previous advances only focused on how to select the optimal parameter criteria from Pareto front, without any suggestion for the construction of specific networks. To overcome this deficiency, this paper proposes an inverse model from $(\delta(G),I'(G))$ to $G$, by means of evolutionary computing approach, we propose a novel inverse model to obtain the optimal solutions for candidate graphs. The main procedure is composed of pseudo-greedy acceleration, cross-mutation and diversity enhancement modules. The practicality of the algorithm is verified by means of pilot experiments. The code in this paper is made public on https://github.com/AizhEngHN/Inverse-model-for-network-construction-G-I-G-G.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Circular-arc Graphs: II. McConnell Flipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a flipping transformation from circular-arc graphs to interval graphs with certain patterns of representations. Beyond its algorithmic implications, this transformation is instrumental in identifying all minimal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. We conduct a structural study of this transformation, and for $C_{4}$-free graphs, we achieve a complete characterization of these patterns. This characterization allows us, among other things, to identify all minimal chordal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial alphabet-dependent bounds for insdel codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes resilient to synchronization errors such as insertions and deletions are known as insdel codes. Due to their important applications in DNA storage and computational biology, insdel codes have recently become a focal point of research in coding theory.
  In this paper, we present several new combinatorial upper and lower bounds on the maximum size of $q$-ary insdel codes. Our main upper bound is a sphere-packing bound obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. It improves upon previous results for cases when the distance $d$ or the alphabet size $q$ is large. Our first lower bound is derived from a connection between insdel codes and matchings in special hypergraphs. This lower bound, together with our upper bound, shows that for fixed block length $n$ and edit distance $d$, when $q$ is sufficiently large, the maximum size of insdel codes is $ \frac{q^{n-\frac{d}{2}+1}}{{n\choose \frac{d}{2}-1}}(1 \pm o(1))$. The second lower bound refines Alon et al.'s recent logarithmic improvement on Levenshtein's GV-type bound and extends its applicability to large $q$ and $d$.</description>

      <title>A point-variety incidence theorem over finite fields, and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incidence problems between geometric objects is a key area of focus in the field of discrete geometry. Among them, the study of incidence problems over finite fields have received a considerable amount of attention in recent years.
  In this paper, by characterizing the singular values and singular vectors of the corresponding incidence matrix through group algebras, we prove a bound on the number of incidences between points and varieties of a certain form over finite fields. Our result leads to a new incidence bound for points and flats in finite geometries, which improves previous results for certain parameter regimes. As another application of our point-variety incidence bound, we prove a result on pinned distance problems by Phuong et al. and Cilleruelo et al. under a weaker condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Jacobi-Trudi identity as a base, we establish parallels between the theory of totally positive integer sequences and Koszul algebras. We then focus on the case of quadric hypersurface rings and use this parallel to construct new analogues of Schur modules. We investigate some of their Lie-theoretic properties (and in more detail in a followup article) and use them to construct pure free resolutions for quadric hypersurface rings which are completely analogous to the construction given by Eisenbud, Fl{\o}ystad, and Weyman in the case of polynomial rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier work, finite groups whose power graphs are minimally edge connected have been classified. In this article, first we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary graph to be minimally edge connected. Consequently, we characterize finite groups whose enhanced power graphs and order superpower graphs, respectively, are minimally edge connected. Moreover, for a finite non-cyclic group $G$, we prove that $G$ is an elementary abelian $2$-group if and only if its enhanced power graph is minimally connected. Also, we show that $G$ is a finite $p$-group if and only if its order superpower graph is minimally connected. Finally, we characterize all the finite nilpotent groups such that the minimum degree and the vertex connectivity of their order superpower graphs are equal.</description>

Abstract: We provide a programmable recursive algorithm for the $\mathbb{S}_n$-representations on the cohomology of the moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n}$ of $n$-pointed stable curves of genus 0. As an application, we find explicit inductive and asymptotic formulas for the invariant part $H^*(\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n}/\mathbb{S}_n)$ and prove that its Poincar\'e polynomial is asymptotically log-concave. Based on numerical computations with our algorithm, we further conjecture that the sequence $\{H^{2k}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n})\}$ of $\mathbb{S}_n$-modules is equivariantly log-concave.</description>

Abstract: Orchards are a biologically relevant class of phylogenetic networks as they can describe treelike evolutionary histories augmented with horizontal transfer events. Moreover, the class has attractive mathematical characterizations that can be exploited algorithmically. On the other hand, undirected orchard networks have hardly been studied yet. Here, we prove that deciding whether an undirected, binary phylogenetic network is an orchard -- or equivalently, whether it has an orientation that makes it a rooted orchard -- is NP-hard. For this, we introduce a new characterization of undirected orchards which could be useful for proving positive results.</description>

      <title>Sets with no solutions to some symmetric linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand the class of linear symmetric equations for which large sets with no non-trivial solutions are known. Our idea is based on first finding a small set with no solutions and then enlarging it to arbitrary size using a multi-dimensional construction, crucially assuming the equation in primitive. We start by presenting the technique on some new equations. Then we use it to show that a symmetric equation with randomly chosen coefficients has a near-optimal set with no non-trivial solutions. We also show a construction for a wide class of symmetric equation in 6 variables. In the final section we present a couple of remarks on non-symmetric equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the torus equivariant K-homology ring of the affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ where $G$ is a connected reductive linear algebraic group. In type $A$, we introduce equivariantly deformed symmetric functions called the K-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions as the Schubert bases. The functions are constructed by Demazure operators acting on equivariant parameters. As an application, we provide a Ginzburg-Peterson type realization of the torus-equivariant K-homology ring of $\mathrm{Gr}_{{SL}_n}$ as the coordinate ring of a centralizer family for $PGL_n(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>On the Cop Number of String Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cops and Robber is a well-studied two-player pursuit-evasion game played on a graph, where a group of cops tries to capture the robber. The \emph{cop number} of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to capture the robber. Gaven\v{c}iak et al.~[Eur. J. of Comb. 72, 45--69 (2018)] studied the game on intersection graphs and established that the cop number for the class of string graphs is at most 15, and asked as an open question to improve this bound for string graphs and subclasses of string graphs. We address this question and establish that the cop number of a string graph is at most 13. To this end, we develop a novel \textit{guarding} technique. We further establish that this technique can be useful for other Cops and Robber games on graphs admitting a representation. In particular, we show that four cops have a winning strategy for a variant of Cops and Robber, named Fully Active Cops and Robber, on planar graphs, addressing an open question of Gromovikov et al.~[Austr. J. Comb. 76(2), 248--265 (2020)]. In passing, we also improve the known bounds on the cop number of boxicity 2 graphs.</description>

      <title>The Reverse Littlewood--Offord problem of Erd\H{o}s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{n}$ be a sequence of independent Rademacher random variables. We prove that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for any unit vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$,
  $$\Pr\left[||\epsilon_1 v_1+\ldots+\epsilon_n v_n||_2 \leq \sqrt{2}\right]\geq \frac{c}{n}.$$
  This resolves the only remaining conjecture from the seminal paper of Erd\H{o}s on the Littlewood--Offord problem, and it is sharp both in the sense that the constant $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be reduced and that the magnitude $n^{-1}$ is best possible. We also prove polynomial bounds for the analogous problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cops and robbers pebbling in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we merge the two fields of Cops and Robbers and Graph Pebbling to introduce the new topic of Cops and Robbers Pebbling. Both paradigms can be described by moving tokens (the cops) along the edges of a graph to capture a special token (the robber). In Cops and Robbers, all tokens move freely, whereas, in Graph Pebbling, some of the chasing tokens disappear with movement while the robber is stationary. In Cops and Robbers Pebbling, some of the chasing tokens (cops) disappear with movement, while the robber moves freely. We define the cop pebbling number of a graph to be the minimum number of cops necessary to capture the robber in this context, and present upper and lower bounds and exact values, some involving various domination parameters, for an array of graph classes, including paths, cycles, trees, chordal graphs, high girth graphs, and cop-win graphs, as well as graph products. Furthermore we show that the analogous inequality for Graham's Pebbling Conjecture fails for cop pebbling and posit a conjecture along the lines of Meyniel's Cops and Robbers Conjecture that may hold for cop pebbling. We also offer several new problems.</description>

      <title>Isolation of regular graphs and $k$-chromatic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G - N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Thus, $\iota(G,\{K_1\})$ is the domination number of $G$. For any integer $k \geq 1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ be the set of regular graphs of degree at least $k-1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$ be the set of graphs whose chromatic number is at least $k$, and let $\mathcal{F}_{3,k}$ be the union of $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$. Thus, $k$-cliques are members of both $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$. We prove that for each $i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, $\frac{m+1}{{k \choose 2} + 2}$ is a best possible upper bound on $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{i,k})$ for connected $m$-edge graphs $G$ that are not $k$-cliques. The bound is attained by infinitely many (non-isomorphic) graphs. The proof of the bound depends on determining the graphs attaining the bound. This appears to be a new feature in the literature on isolation. Among the result's consequences are a sharp bound of Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author on the $k$-clique isolation number and a sharp bound on the cycle isolation number.</description>

Abstract: We show that a randomly perturbed digraph, where we start with a dense digraph $D_\alpha$ and add a small number of random edges to it, will typically contain a fixed orientation of a bounded degree spanning tree. This answers a question posed by Araujo, Balogh, Krueger, Piga and Treglown and generalizes the corresponding result for randomly perturbed graphs by Krivelevich, Kwan and Sudakov. More specifically, we prove that there exists a constant $c = c(\alpha, \Delta)$ such that if $T$ is an oriented tree with maximum degree $\Delta$ and $D_\alpha$ is an $n$-vertex digraph with minimum semidegree $\alpha n$, then the graph obtained by adding $cn$ uniformly random edges to $D_\alpha$ will contain $T$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>Isolation of squares in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set $V(G)$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G - N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Thus, $\iota(G,\{K_1\})$ is the domination number of $G$. The second author showed that if $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of cycles and $G$ is a connected $n$-vertex graph that is not a triangle, then $\iota(G,\mathcal{F}) \leq \left \lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right \rfloor$. This bound is attainable for every $n$ and solved a problem of Caro and Hansberg. A question that arises immediately is how much smaller an upper bound can be if $\mathcal{F} = \{C_k\}$ for some $k \geq 3$, where $C_k$ is a cycle of length $k$. The problem is to determine the smallest real number $c_k$ (if it exists) such that for some finite set $\mathcal{E}_k$ of graphs, $\iota(G, \{C_k\}) \leq c_k |V(G)|$ for every connected graph $G$ that is not an $\mathcal{E}_k$-graph. The above-mentioned result yields $c_3 = \frac{1}{4}$ and $\mathcal{E}_3 = \{C_3\}$. The second author also showed that if $k \geq 5$ and $c_k$ exists, then $c_k \geq \frac{2}{2k + 1}$. We prove that $c_4 = \frac{1}{5}$ and determine $\mathcal{E}_4$, which consists of three $4$-vertex graphs and six $9$-vertex graphs. The $9$-vertex graphs in $\mathcal{E}_4$ were fully determined by means of a computer program. A method that has the potential of yielding similar results is introduced.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive explicit formulas for two distinct values. The first is the total number of symmetric peaks in a set partition of $[n]$ with exactly $k$ blocks, and the second one is the total number of non-symmetric peaks in a set partition of $[n]$ with exactly $k$ blocks. We represent these results in two ways. First by using the theory of generating functions, and the second by using combinatorial tools.</description>

      <title>On the on-line coloring of unit interval graphs with proper interval representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the problem as a two-player game between Algorithm and Builder. The game is played in rounds. Each round, Builder presents an interval that is neither contained in nor contains any previously presented interval. Algorithm immediately and irrevocably assigns the interval a color that has not been assigned to any interval intersecting it. The set of intervals form an interval representation for a unit interval graph and the colors form a proper coloring of that graph. For every positive integer $\omega$, we define the value $R(\omega)$ as the maximum number of colors for which Builder has a strategy that forces Algorithm to use $R(\omega)$ colors with the restriction that the unit interval graph constructed cannot contain a clique of size $\omega$. In 1981, Chrobak and \'{S}lusarek showed that $R(\omega)\leq2\omega -1$. In 2005, Epstein and Levy showed that $R(\omega)\geq\lfloor{3\omega/2\rfloor}$. This problem remained unsolved for $\omega\geq 3$. In 2022, Bir\'o and Curbelo showed that $R(3)=5$. In this paper, we show that $R(4)=7$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be Ramsey for a tuple of graphs $(H_1,\dots,H_r)$ if every $r$-coloring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H_i$ in color $i$, for some $i$. A fundamental question at the intersection of Ramsey theory and the theory of random graphs is to determine the threshold at which the binomial random graph $G_{n,p}$ becomes a.a.s. Ramsey for a fixed tuple $(H_1,\dots,H_r)$, and a famous conjecture of Kohayakawa and Kreuter predicts this threshold. Earlier work of Mousset-Nenadov-Samotij, Bowtell-Hancock-Hyde, and Kuperwasser-Samotij-Wigderson has reduced this probabilistic problem to a deterministic graph decomposition conjecture. In this paper, we resolve this deterministic problem, thus proving the Kohayakawa-Kreuter conjecture. Along the way, we prove a number of novel graph decomposition results which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how small the Randi\'c index of a graph can be in terms of its matching number, and prove several results. We give best-possible linear bounds for graphs of small excess and for subcubic graphs; in the former case the size of excess we permit is qualitatively the best possible. We show that a linear bound holds for any sparse hereditary graph class (such as planar graphs). In general, however, we show that it can be much smaller than linear. We determine the asymptotic growth rate of the minimum Randi\'c index for graphs with a near perfect matching, and conjecture that the same bounds hold for all graphs.</description>

      <title>A congruential recurrence characterizes the inverses of S\'{o}s permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a proof of the three gaps theorem, a class of permutations known as the S\'{o}s permutations was introduced. It is known that a S\'{o}s permutation, as a sequence, satisfies a certain recurrence (S\'{o}s's recurrence), however, whether the converse holds remains unknown. On the other hand, the inverses of S\'{o}s permutations have been studied also. It has been reported that such a permutation satisfies a congruential recurrence as a sequence. The converse problem of this fact, i.e., whether a permutation satisfying the congruential recurrence is the inverse of a S\'{o}s permutation, is also unsolved, except for a finite number of the degrees of the permutations. This paper relates the set of permutations satisfying the congruential recurrence to other sets of permutations and gives upper bounds for their cardinalities. The upper bounds are in fact tight. In particular, the set of permutations satisfying the congruential recurrence has the same cardinality as that of S\'{o}s permutations, giving the affirmative answer to the above unsolved problem as a corollary. As another corollary, it is shown that all permutation, which is regarded as a congruential quasi-progression of diameter 1 in that the set formed by the first order differences modulo the degree of the permutation is a singleton or a set of two successive integers, is the inverse of a S\'{o}s permutation with an elementary operation called as shift applied. As an application of these facts, we present a procedure that lifts the set of the inverses of the S\'{o}s permutations of a given degree to the set of the same kind with the degree increased by one, without referring to the underlying parameters defining the S\'{o}s permutations or the Farey sequence associated to them.</description>

Abstract: A \emph{complete geometric graph} consists of a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, in general position, and all segments (edges) connecting them. It is a well known question of Bose, Hurtado, Rivera-Campo, and Wood, whether there exists a positive constant $c&lt;1$, such that every complete geometric graph on $n$ points can be partitioned into at most $cn$ plane graphs (that is, noncrossing subgraphs). We answer this question in the affirmative in the special case where the underlying point set $P$ is \emph{dense}, which means that the ratio between the maximum and the minimum distances in $P$ is of the order of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a symbolic computation method for automatically transforming $q$-hypergeometric identities to $q$-binomial identities. Through this method, many previously proven $q$-binomial identities, including $q$-Saalsch\"utz's formula and $q$-Suranyi's formula, are re-fund, and numerous new ones are discovered. Moreover, the generation of the identities is accompanied by the corresponding proofs. During the transformation process, different ranges of variable values and various combinations of $q$-Pochhammer symbols yield different identities. The algorithm maps variable constraints to positive elements in an ordered vector space and employs a backtracking method to provide the feasible variable constraints and $q$-binomial coefficient combinations for each step.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>On the difference between the chromatic and cochromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cochromatic number $\zeta(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of colors in a vertex-coloring of $G$ such that every color class forms an independent set or a clique. In three papers written around 1990, Erd\H{o}s, Gimbel and collaborators raised several open problems regarding the relationship of the chromatic and cochromatic number of a graph. In this short note, we address several of these problems, in particular
  -we disprove a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Gimbel and Straight from 1988,
  -answer negatively a problem posed by Erd\H{o}s and Gimbel in 1993, and
  -give positive evidence for a 1000\$--question of Erd\H{o}s and Gimbel.</description>

Abstract: Defining distances over finite fields formally by $||x-y||:=(x_1-y_1)^2+\cdots + (x_d-y_d)^2$ for $x,y\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$, distance problems naturally arise in analogy to those studied by Erd\H{o}s and Falconer in Euclidean space. Given a graph $G$ and a set $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^2$, let $\Delta_G(E)$ be the generalized distance set corresponding to $G$. In the case when $G$ is the complete graph on $k+1$ vertices, Bennett, Hart, Iosevich, Pakianathan, and Rudnev showed that when $|E|\geq q^{d-\frac{d-1}{k+1}}$, it follows that $|\Delta_G(E)|\geq cq^{\binom{k+1}{2}}$. In the case when $k=d=2$, the threshold can be improved to $|E|\geq q^{\frac{8}{5}}$.
  Moreover, Jardine, Iosevich, and McDonald showed that in the case when $G$ is a tree with $k+1$ vertices, then whenever $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, $d\geq 2$ satisfies $|E|\geq C_kq^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$, it follows that $\Delta_G(E)=\mathbb{F}_q^k$. In this paper, we present a technique which enables us to study certain graphs with both rigid and non-rigid components. In particular, we show that for $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^2$, $q=p^n$, $n$ odd, $p\equiv 3 \ \text{mod} \ 4$, and $G$ is the graph consisting of two triangles joined at a vertex, then whenever $|E|\geq q^{\frac{12}{7}}$, it follows that $|\Delta_G(E)|\geq cq^6$.</description>

      <title>Short proof of the hypergraph container theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a short and simple proof of the celebrated hypergraph container theorem of Balogh--Morris--Samotij and Saxton--Thomason. On a high level, our argument utilises the idea of iteratively taking vertices of largest degree from an independent set and constructing a hypergraph of lower uniformity which preserves independent sets and inherits edge distribution. The original algorithms for constructing containers also remove in each step vertices of high degree which are not in the independent set. Our modified algorithm postpones this until the end, which surprisingly results in a significantly simplified analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the generalized simplicial polytopic numbers P$_{n}^{d}(s,t)$, defined on generalized Fibonacci polynomials with parameters $s,t$, are introduced. Moreover, we obtain beautiful generating functions of the numbers P$_{n}^{d}(s,t)$, which are related to the $(s,t)$-derivatives of the Partial Theta function $\Theta_{0}(x,q)$.</description>

      <title>On the Approximation Ratio of the $k$-Opt and Lin-Kernighan Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12755v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $k$-Opt and Lin-Kernighan algorithm are two of the most important local search approaches for the Metric TSP. Both start with an arbitrary tour and make local improvements in each step to get a shorter tour. We show that for any fixed $k\geq 3$ the approximation ratio of the $k$-Opt algorithm for Metric TSP is $O(\sqrt[k]{n})$. Assuming the Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture, we prove a matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt[k]{n})$. Unconditionally, we obtain matching bounds for $k=3,4,6$ and a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\frac{2}{3k-3}})$. Our most general bounds depend on the values of a function from extremal graph theory and are tight up to a factor logarithmic in the number of vertices unconditionally. Moreover, all the upper bounds also apply to a parameterized generalization of the Lin-Kernighan algorithm with appropriate parameters. We also show that the approximation ratio of $k$-Opt for Graph TSP is $\Omega\left(\frac{\log(n)}{\log\log(n)}\right)$ and $O\left(\left(\frac{\log(n)}{\log\log(n)}\right)^{\log_2(9)+\epsilon}\right)$ for all $\epsilon&gt;0$. For the (1,2)-TSP we give a lower bound of $\frac{11}{10}$ on the approximation ratio of the $k$-improv and $k$-Opt algorithm for arbitrary fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Cohomological Phenomena in the Multiparametric Models of Random Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on the (co)homology of various models of random simplicial complexes. So far, it has always been examined merely as a list of groups. This paper expands upon this by describing both the ring structure and the Steenrod-algebra structure of the cohomology of the multiparametric models. For the lower model, we prove that the ring structure is always a.a.s trivial, while, for certain parameters, the Steenrod-algebra a.a.s acts non-trivially. This reveals that complex multi-dimensional topological structures appear as subcomplexes of this model. In contrast, we improve upon a result of Farber and Nowik, and assert that the cohomology of the upper multiparametric model is a.a.s concentrated in a single dimension.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued.</description>
