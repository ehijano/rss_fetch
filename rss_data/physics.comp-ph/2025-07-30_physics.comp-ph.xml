      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of Molecules from Real-Time Propagation Based on the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-time propagation method for computing linear and nonlinear optical properties of molecules based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The method follows the time evolution of the one-particle density matrix under an external electric field. We include electron-electron interaction effects through a self-energy based on the screened exchange approximation. Quasiparticle energies are taken from a prior $GW$ calculation to construct the effective single-particle Hamiltonian and we represent all operators and wavefunctions in an atom-centered Gaussian basis. We benchmark the accuracy of the real-time propagation against the standard linear-response Bethe-Salpeter equation using a set of organic molecules. We find very good agreement when computing linear-response isotropic polarizability spectra from both approaches, with a mean absolute deviation of 30~meV in peak positions. Beyond linear response, we simulate second harmonic generation and optical rectification in a non-centrosymmetric molecule. These phenomena are not captured by the commonly used linear-response Bethe-Salpeter equation. We foresee broad applicability of real-time propagation based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the study of linear and nonlinear optical properties of molecules as the method has a similar computational cost as time-dependent density functional theory with hybrid functionals.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Dynamical Boundary Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are numerical solvers that embed all the physical information of a system into the loss function of a neural network. In this way the learned solution accounts for data (if available), the governing differential equations, or any other constraint known of the physical problem. However, they face serious issues, notably their tendency to converge on trivial or misleading solutions. The latter occurs when, although the loss function reaches low values the model makes incorrect predictions. These difficulties become especially significant in differential equations involving multi-scale behavior, such as rapidly varying terms and solutions exhibiting strong oscillatory behavior. To address these challenges, we introduce the Dynamical Boundary Constraint (DBC) algorithm, which imposes restrictions on the loss function based on prior training of the PINN. To demonstrate its applicability, we tested this approach on examples of different areas of physics.</description>

      <title>Chromo: A High-Performance Python Interface to Hadronic Event Generators for Collider and Cosmic-Ray Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of hadronic and nuclear interactions are essential in both collider and astroparticle physics. The Chromo package provides a unified Python interface to multiple widely used hadronic event generators, including EPOS, DPMJet, Sibyll, QGSJet, and Pythia. Built on top of their original Fortran and C++ implementations, Chromo offers a zero-overhead abstraction layer suitable for use in Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or from the command line, while preserving the performance of direct calls to the generators. It is easy to install via precompiled binary wheels distributed through PyPI, and it integrates well with the Scientific Python ecosystem. Chromo supports event export in HepMC, ROOT, and SVG formats and provides a consistent interface for inspecting, filtering, and modifying particle collision events. This paper describes the architecture, typical use cases, and performance characteristics of Chromo and its role in contemporary astroparticle simulations, such as in the MCEq cascade solver.</description>

      <title>Following the Committor Flow: A Data-Driven Discovery of Transition Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), have emerged as a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations and PVSA cycle optimization. Structural parameters such as pore volume, pore size, and isosteric adsorption enthalpy were first calculated, followed by atomistic grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Process-level performances of the six materials were evaluated and optimized using the Thompson Sampling Efficient Multi-objective Optimization (TSEMO) algorithm. From the process-level optimization, we found that FumCALF-20 is the only material that can reach CH4 purity &gt; 0.90 while maintaining high recovery. Other materials either lacked sufficient CO2 capacity or showed inefficient CH4 desorption at low pressures. This study underscores the value of process-level optimization in MOF evaluation and screening for energy-efficient biogas upgrading.</description>

      <title>Structure Preserving Finite Volume Schemes on Voronoi Grids: Curl Involution, Asymptotic Limit and Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new curl-free and thermodynamically compatible finite volume scheme on Voronoi grids to solve compressible heat conducting flows written in first-order hyperbolic form. The approach is based on the definition of compatible discrete curl-grad operators, exploiting the triangular nature of the dual mesh. We design a cell solver reminiscent of the nodal solvers used in Lagrangian schemes to discretize the evolution equation for the thermal impulse vector, and we demonstrate that the resulting numerical scheme ensures energy conservation, local non-negative entropy production, as well as asymptotic consistency with the classical Fourier law in the stiff relaxation limit. A novel technique is proposed to transfer residuals from the dual to the primal mesh as subfluxes, which eventually yields the construction of entropy compatible semi-discrete methods. The scheme and its properties are validated on a set of numerical test cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the adjoint path-kernel method for the parameter-gradient of SDEs, where the observable is averaged at a particular time or over the stationary measure. Its cost is almost independent of the number of parameters; it extends the conventional backpropagation method to cases with gradient explosion. It works for non-hyperbolic systems with multiplicative noise controlled by parameters. We derive a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system.</description>

      <title>Weak decaying collective-excitation approximation for Yukawa one-component plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the theoretical model of weak decaying collective excitations characteristic of many-particle systems with long-range interaction potentials is developed using the example of one-component strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas. The proposed model is based on the self-consistent relaxation theory of collective dynamics and covers spatial scales from extended hydrodynamics to scales related to the mean interparticle distance. The theoretical model reproduces the dynamic structure factor spectra and the corresponding dispersion characteristics in agreement with molecular dynamics simulation data without using any fitting parameters. In the limit of small wave numbers, the correspondence of the proposed theoretical model with the damped harmonic oscillator model is established. The simple analytical expression for the sound attenuation coefficient of strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas is obtained.</description>

      <title>Towards a Large Physics Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a benchmark framework developed by and for the scientific community to evaluate, monitor and steer large language model development in fundamental physics. Building on philosophical concepts of scientific understanding and creativity, we develop a scoring system in which each question is scored by an expert for its correctness, difficulty, and surprise. The questions are of three forms: (i) multiple-choice questions for conceptual understanding, (ii) analytical problems requiring mathematical derivation, and (iii) openended tasks requiring complex problem solving. Our current dataset contains diverse set of examples, including a machine learning challenge to classify high-energy physics events, such as the four top quark signal. To ensure continued relevance, we propose a living benchmark, where physicists contribute questions, for instance alongside new publications. We invite contributions via: http://www.physicsbenchmarks.org/. We hope that this benchmark will enable a targeted AI development that can make a meaningful contribution to fundamental physics research.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reduced Order Modeling Based on HODMD to Predict Intraventricular Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of cardiac blood flow is crucial for advancing data-driven tools in cardiovascular research and clinical applications. Recently, the accuracy and availability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies for simulating intraventricular flow have increased. However, these methods remain complex and computationally costly. This study presents a reduced order model (ROM) based on higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD). The proposed approach enables accurate reconstruction and long term prediction of left ventricle flow fields. The method is tested on two idealized ventricular geometries exhibiting distinct flow regimes to assess its robustness under different hemodynamic conditions. By leveraging a small number of training snapshots and focusing on the dominant periodic components representing the physics of the system, the HODMD-based model accurately reconstructs the flow field over entire cardiac cycles and provides reliable long-term predictions beyond the training window. The reconstruction and prediction errors remain below 5\% for the first geometry and below 10\% for the second, even when using as few as the first 3 cycles of simulated data, representing the transitory regime. Additionally, the approach reduces computational costs with a speed-up factor of at least $10^{5}$ compared to full-order simulations, enabling fast surrogate modeling of complex cardiac flows. These results highlight the potential of spectrally-constrained HODMD as a robust and interpretable ROM for simulating intraventricular hemodynamics. This approach shows promise for integration in real-time analysis and patient specific models.</description>

      <title>evoxels: A differentiable physics framework for voxel-based microstructure simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists use advanced microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure, while theorists and computational scientists develop models that link processing, structure, and properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal microstructures and manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging with predictive simulations and data-driven optimization accelerates discovery and deepens understanding of process-structure-property relationships. The differentiable physics framework evoxels is based on a fully Pythonic, unified voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical simulations, inverse modeling, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Unified machine-learning framework for property prediction and time-evolution simulation of strained alloy microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta, and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific, prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating further temporal evolution.</description>

      <title>Learning Kinetic Monte Carlo stochastic dynamics with Deep Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and future perspectives are critically discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating CO Adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) Surfaces Using Machine Learning Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "CO adsorption puzzle", a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations (GGA) in density functional theory to replicate CO's experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The above work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description>

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear, constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix. This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quantum Koopman method for simulating nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.</description>

      <title>A Massively Parallel Performance Portable Free-space Spectral Poisson Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vico et al. (2016) suggest a fast algorithm for computing volume potentials, beneficial to fields with problems requiring the solution of the free-space Poisson's equation, such as beam and plasma physics. Currently, the standard is the algorithm of Hockney and Eastwood (1988), with second order in convergence at best. The algorithm proposed by Vico et al. converges spectrally for sufficiently smooth functions i.e. faster than any fixed order in the number of grid points. We implement a performance portable version of the traditional Hockney-Eastwood and the novel Vico-Greengard Poisson solver as part of the IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer) library. For sufficiently smooth source functions, the Vico-Greengard algorithm achieves higher accuracy than the Hockney-Eastwood method with the same grid size, reducing the computational demands of high resolution simulations since one could use coarser grids to achieve them. Additionally, we propose an improvement to the Vico-Greengard method which further reduces its memory footprint. This is important for GPUs, which have limited memory, and should be taken into account when selecting numerical algorithms for performance portable codes. Finally, we showcase performance through GPU and CPU scaling studies on the Perlmutter (NERSC) supercomputer, with efficiencies staying above 50% in the strong scaling case. To showcase portability, we also run the scaling studies on the Alps supercomputer at CSCS, Switzerland and the GPU partition of the Lumi supercomputer at CSC, Finland.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Body-Orders in Linear Atomic Cluster Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon and Silicon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2$ to $K=5$ trained on a diverse Carbon dataset and on Silicon dimers to pentamers. The potentials trained on diverse structures with standard ACE bases are not able to recover the correct dimer curves much less produce stable curves or solutions. While employing ACE bases removed of self-interactions still does not generalize to the DFT-expected results, properly tailored datasets and basis sets are able to show signs of convergence and stability in the curves and expansions, suggesting a method to build potentials with interpretable bases with respect to the cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with Just-In-Time compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Unearthing large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the Large Hadron Collider's Run 3 in progress, the 125 GeV Higgs boson couplings are being examined in greater detail, while searching for additional scalars. Multi-Higgs frameworks allow Higgs couplings to significantly deviate from Standard Model values, enabling indirect probes of extra scalars. We consider the possibility of large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings in the softly-broken Z2xZ2' three-Higgs doublet model with CP violating coefficients. To explore the parameter space of the model, we employ a Machine Learning algorithm that significantly enhances sampling efficiency. Using it, we find new regions of parameter space and observable consequences, not found with previous techniques. This method leverages an Evolutionary Strategy to quickly converge towards valid regions with an additional Novelty Reward mechanism. We use this model as a prototype to illustrate the potential of the new techniques, applicable to any Physics Beyond the Standard Model scenario.</description>

      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a fundamental component of many quantum computing algorithms. In this paper, we present an alternative method for factoring this transformation. Inspired by this approach, we introduce a new quantum circuit for implementing the QFT. We show that this circuit is more efficient than the conventional design. Furthermore, using this circuit, we develop alternative versions of the HHL algorithm and Shor's algorithm, which also demonstrate improved performance compared to their standard implementations.</description>
