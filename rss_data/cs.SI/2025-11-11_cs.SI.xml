      <title>Food as Soft Power: Taiwanese Gastrodiplomacy on Social Media and Algorithmic Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become pivotal for projecting national identity and soft power in an increasingly digital world. This study examines the digital manifestation of Taiwanese gastrodiplomacy by focusing on bubble tea -- a culturally iconic beverage -- leveraging a dataset comprising 107,169 posts from the popular lifestyle social media platform Instagram. Including 315,279,227 engagements, 4,756,320 comments, and 8,097,260,651 views over five full years (2020-2024), we investigate how social media facilitates discussion about Taiwanese cuisine and contributes to Taiwan's digital soft power. Our analysis reveals that bubble tea consistently emerges as the dominant representation of Taiwanese cuisine across Meta's Instagram channels. However, this dominance also indicates vulnerability in gastrodiplomatic strategy compared to other countries. Additionally, we find evidence that Instagram suppresses bubble tea posts mentioning Taiwan by 1,200% -- roughly a twelve-fold decrease in exposure -- relative to posts without such mentions. Crucially, we observe a significant drop in the number of posts, views, and engagement following Lai's inauguration in May 2024. This study ultimately contributes to understanding how digital platforms can enable or disable gastrodiplomacy, soft power, and cultural diplomacy while highlighting the need for greater algorithmic transparency. By noting Taiwan's bubble tea's digital engagement and footprint, critical insights are brought for nations seeking to leverage soft power through gastronomic means in a politicized digital era and researchers trying to better understand algorithmic suppression.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Enterprise Big Data Microservice Architecture Based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of digitization and intelligence, enterprise big data processing platforms have become increasingly important in data management. However, traditional monolithic architectures, due to their high coupling, are unable to cope with increasingly complex demands in the face of business expansion and increased data volume, resulting in limited platform scalability and decreased data collection efficiency. This article proposes a solution for enterprise big data processing platform based on microservice architecture, based on the concept of Domain Driven Design (DDD). Through in-depth analysis of business requirements, the functional and non functional requirements of the platform in various scenarios were determined, and the DDD method was used to decompose the core business logic into independent microservice modules, enabling data collection, parsing, cleaning, and visualization functions to be independently developed, deployed, and upgraded, thereby improving the flexibility and scalability of the system. This article also designs an automated data collection process based on microservices and proposes an improved dynamic scheduling algorithm to efficiently allocate data collection tasks to Docker nodes, and monitor the collection progress and service status in real time to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of data collection. Through the implementation and testing of the platform, it has been verified that the enterprise big data processing platform based on microservice architecture has significantly improved scalability, data quality, and collection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Construction and Evolutionary Analysis of a Game Model for Supply Chain Finance Funding Based on Blockchain Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current surge in supply chain finance has significantly alleviated the "capital challenges" faced by domestic related enterprises, enabling enterprises upstream and subsequent stages of the industrial chain to achieve effective circulation of financing services in the supply chain based on the credit of core enterprises. By gathering essential information from the heart of the supply chain, supply chain financing enables efficient resource distribution and aids all stakeholders in making well-informed choices. However, supply chain finance in China still faces numerous obstacles, such as information asymmetry and inefficient credit transmission chains, hindering its long-term development. This paper designs an operational framework for supply chain finance incorporating blockchain technology, clearly defines the participating entities, and analyzes their business relationships. Based upon evolutionary game theory, a supply chain finance financing game model incorporating blockchain technology is constructed. A comparative analysis of the model's equilibrium points and their stability is conducted. The choices of evolutionary equilibrium strategies adopted by small and medium-sized enterprises, key players, and financing entities within this framework are explored, and the influence of blockchain technology on the prerequisites for completing supply chain finance transactions is investigated.</description>

      <title>Research On CODP Localization Decision Model Of Automotive Supply Chain Based On Delayed Manufacturing Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the market background of increasingly personalized product demand and compressed response cycle, the traditional manufacturing model with standardized mass production as the core has been difficult to meet the dual expectations of customers for differentiation and fast delivery. In order to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and market response, automobile manufacturers need to build a production system that takes into account cost and flexibility. Based on the delayed response manufacturing strategy, this study built an order response node configuration model suitable for automotive manufacturing scenarios, focusing on the positioning of order driven intervention points in the production process. The model comprehensively considers the structural cost changes brought by process adjustment, the dynamic characteristics of the changes of unit manufacturing cost and intermediate inventory cost at different stages with the location of nodes, and introduces delivery time constraints to embed time factors into the inventory decision logic to enhance the practicality of the model and the adaptation of realistic constraints. In terms of solution methods, this paper adopts function fitting and simulation analysis methods, combined with mathematical modeling tools, systematically describes the change trend of total cost, and verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the model structure and solution through actual enterprise cases. The research results provide a theoretical basis and decision support for automobile manufacturing enterprises to realize the synergy of flexible production and cost control in the environment of variable demand, and also provide an empirical reference for the implementation path and system optimization of subsequent relevant strategies.</description>

      <title>The Role and Mechanism of Deep Statistical Machine Learning In Biological Target Screening and Immune Microenvironment Regulation of Asthma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important source of small molecule drugs, natural products show remarkable biological activities with their rich types and unique structures. However, due to the limited number of samples and structural complexity, the rapid discovery of lead compounds is limited. Therefore, in this study, natural inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) and Phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) were screened by combining computer aided drug design (CADD) technology and deep learning method, and their activities were verified by enzyme activity experiment and enzymo-linked immunoassay. These two enzymes have important application potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, but PDE4 inhibitors may cause adverse reactions, so it is particularly important to develop both effective and safe dual-target inhibitors. In addition, as a potential target of hyperuricemia, the development of natural inhibitors of xanthine oxidase (X0) is also of great value. We used pharmacophore technology for virtual screening, combined with molecular docking technology to improve accuracy, and finally selected 16 potential natural inhibitors of PDE4/7, and verified their binding stability through molecular dynamics simulation. The results of this study laid a foundation for establishing an efficient dual-target inhibitor screening system and exploring the lead compounds of novel X0 inhibitors.</description>

      <title>Characterizing AI Manipulation Risks in Brazilian YouTube Climate Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change poses a global threat to public health, food security, and economic stability. Addressing it requires evidence-based policies and a nuanced understanding of how the threat is perceived by the public, particularly within visual social media, where narratives quickly evolve through voices of individuals, politicians, NGOs, and institutions. This study investigates climate-related discourse on YouTube within the Brazilian context, a geopolitically significant nation in global environmental negotiations. Through three case studies, we examine (1) which psychological content traits most effectively drive audience engagement, (2) the extent to which these traits influence content popularity, and (3) whether such insights can inform the design of persuasive synthetic campaigns--such as climate denialism--using recent generative language models. Another contribution of this work is the release of a large publicly available dataset of 226K Brazilian YouTube videos and 2.7M user comments on climate change. The dataset includes fine-grained annotations of persuasive strategies, theory-of-mind categorizations in user responses, and typologies of content creators. This resource can help support future research on digital climate communication and the ethical risk of algorithmically amplified narratives and generative media.</description>

      <title>HyperEF 2.0: Spectral Hypergraph Coarsening via Krylov Subspace Expansion and Resistance-based Local Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces HyperEF 2.0, a scalable framework for spectral coarsening and clustering of large-scale hypergraphs through hyperedge effective resistances, aiming to decompose hypergraphs into multiple node clusters with a small number of inter-cluster hyperedges. Building on the recent HyperEF framework, our approach offers three primary contributions. Specifically, first, by leveraging the expanded Krylov subspace exploiting both clique and star expansions of hyperedges, we can significantly improve the approximation accuracy of effective resistances. Second, we propose a resistance-based local clustering scheme for merging small isolated nodes into nearby clusters, yielding more balanced clusters with substantially improved conductance. Third, the proposed HyperEF 2.0 enables the integration of resistance-based hyperedge weighting and community detection into a multilevel hypergraph partitioning tool, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments on real-world VLSI benchmarks show that HyperEF 2.0 can more effectively coarsen hypergraphs without compromising their structural properties, while delivering much better solution quality (e.g. conductance) than the state-of-the-art hypergraph coarsening methods, such as HyperEF and HyperSF. Moreover, compared to leading hypergraph partitioners such as hMETIS, SpecPart, MedPart, and KaHyPar, our framework consistently achieves smaller cut sizes. In terms of runtime, HyperEF 2.0 attains up to a 4.5x speedup over the latest flow-based local clustering algorithm, HyperSF, demonstrating both superior efficiency and partitioning quality.</description>

      <title>Beyond Centrality: Understanding Urban Street Network Typologies Through Intersection Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of road networks plays a pivotal role in shaping transportation dynamics. It also provides insights into how drivers experience city streets and helps uncover each urban environment's unique characteristics and challenges. Consequently, characterizing cities based on their road network patterns can facilitate the identification of similarities and differences, informing collaborative traffic management strategies, particularly at a regional scale. While previous studies have investigated global network patterns for cities, they have often overlooked detailed characterizations within a single large urban region. Additionally, most existing research uses metrics like degree, centrality, orientation, etc., and misses the nuances of street networks at the intersection level, specifically the geometric angles formed by links at intersections, which could offer a more refined feature for characterization. To address these gaps, this study examines over 100 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We introduce a novel metric for classifying intersections, distinguishing between different types of 3-way and 4-way intersections based on the angles formed at the intersections. Through the application of clustering algorithms in machine learning, we have identified three distinct typologies - grid, orthogonal, and organic cities - within the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric in capturing the differences between cities based on street and intersection patterns. The typologies generated in this study could offer valuable support for city planners and policymakers in crafting a range of practical strategies tailored to the complexities of each city's road network, covering aspects such as evacuation plans, traffic signage placements, and traffic signal control.</description>

      <title>CGLE: Class-label Graph Link Estimator for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is a pivotal task in graph mining with wide-ranging applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graph completion. However, many leading Graph Neural Network (GNN) models often neglect the valuable semantic information aggregated at the class level. To address this limitation, this paper introduces CGLE (Class-label Graph Link Estimator), a novel framework designed to augment GNN-based link prediction models. CGLE operates by constructing a class-conditioned link probability matrix, where each entry represents the probability of a link forming between two node classes. This matrix is derived from either available ground-truth labels or from pseudo-labels obtained through clustering. The resulting class-based prior is then concatenated with the structural link embedding from a backbone GNN, and the combined representation is processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the final prediction. Crucially, CGLE's logic is encapsulated in an efficient preprocessing stage, leaving the computational complexity of the underlying GNN model unaffected. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a broad suite of benchmark datasets, covering both homophilous and sparse heterophilous graphs. The results show that CGLE yields substantial performance gains over strong baselines such as NCN and NCNC, with improvements in HR@100 of over 10 percentage points on homophilous datasets like Pubmed and DBLP. On sparse heterophilous graphs, CGLE delivers an MRR improvement of over 4% on the Chameleon dataset. Our work underscores the efficacy of integrating global, data-driven semantic priors, presenting a compelling alternative to the pursuit of increasingly complex model architectures. Code to reproduce our findings is available at: https://github.com/data-iitd/cgle-icdm2025.</description>

      <title>Past-aware game-theoretic centrality in complex contagion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce past-aware game-theoretic centrality, a class of centrality measures that captures the collaborative contribution of nodes in a network, accounting for both uncertain and certain collaborators. A general framework for computing standard game-theoretic centrality is extended to the past-aware case. As an application, we develop a new heuristic for different versions of the influence maximization problems in complex contagion dynamics, which models processes requiring reinforcement from multiple neighbors to spread. A computationally efficient explicit formula for the corresponding past-aware centrality score is derived, leading to scalable algorithms for identifying the most influential nodes, which in most cases outperform the standard greedy approach in both efficiency and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Deception Decoder: Proposing a Human-Focused Framework for Identifying AI-Generated Content on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) poses a substantial threat to the integrity of information within the contemporary public sphere, which increasingly relies on social media platforms as intermediaries for news consumption. At present, most research efforts are directed toward automated and machine learning-based detection methods, despite growing concerns regarding false positives, social and political biases, and susceptibility to circumvention. This dissertation instead adopts a human-centred approach. It proposes the Deception Decoder; a multimodal, systematic, and topological framework designed to support general users in identifying AI-generated misinformation and disinformation across text, image, and video. The framework was developed through a comparative synthesis of existing models, supplemented by a content analysis of GenAI-video, and refined through a small-scale focus group session. While initial testing indicates promising improvements, further research is required to confirm its generalisability across user groups, and sustained effectiveness over time.</description>

      <title>Network and Risk Analysis of Surety Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surety bonds are financial agreements between a contractor (principal) and obligee (project owner) to complete a project. However, most large-scale projects involve multiple contractors, creating a network and introducing the possibility of incomplete obligations to propagate and result in project failures. Typical models for risk assessment assume independent failure probabilities within each contractor. However, we take a network approach, modeling the contractor network as a directed graph where nodes represent contractors and project owners and edges represent contractual obligations with associated financial records. To understand risk propagation throughout the contractor network, we extend the celebrated Friedkin-Johnsen model and introduce a stochastic process to simulate principal failures across the network. From a theoretical perspective, we show that under natural monotonicity conditions on the contractor network, incorporating network effects leads to increases in both the average risk and the tail probability mass of the loss distribution (i.e. larger right-tail risk) for the surety organization. We further use data from a partnering insurance company to validate our findings, estimating an approximately 2% higher exposure when accounting for network effects.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Data Acquisition and Analysis System for Programming Debugging Process Based On VS Code Plug-In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to meet the needs of students' programming debugging ability training, this paper designs and implements a data acquisition and analysis system for programming debugging process based on VS Code plug-in, which aims to solve the limitation of traditional assessment methods that are difficult to fully evaluate students' debugging ability. The system supports a variety of programming languages, integrates debugging tasks and data acquisition functions, captures students' debugging behavior in the local editor in real time, and uploads the data to the platform database to realize the whole process monitoring and feedback, provides accurate debugging guidance for teachers, and improves the teaching effect. In terms of data analysis, the system proposed a debugging behavior analysis model based on abstract syntax tree, combined with node annotation, sequence recognition and cluster analysis and other technologies, to automatically track the context of students' debugging process and accurately identify key features in the debugging path. Through this tool, the system realizes the intelligent identification and labeling of the debugging direction and behavior pattern, and improves the refinement level of debugging data analysis. In this research system, a complex debugging scenario of multi-file and multi-task is introduced into the debugging problem design, which optimizes the multi-dimensional capturing ability of debugging data and lays a foundation for accurate debugging behavior analysis. Through several practical teaching tests, the feasibility and stability of the system are verified, which proves that it can effectively support procedural evaluation in programming debugging teaching, and provides a new direction for debugging behavior analysis research.</description>

      <title>SugarTextNet: A Transformer-Based Framework for Detecting Sugar Dating-Related Content on Social Media with Context-Aware Focal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06402v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sugar dating-related content has rapidly proliferated on mainstream social media platforms, giving rise to serious societal and regulatory concerns, including commercialization of intimate relationships and the normalization of transactional relationships.~Detecting such content is highly challenging due to the prevalence of subtle euphemisms, ambiguous linguistic cues, and extreme class imbalance in real-world data.~In this work, we present SugarTextNet, a novel transformer-based framework specifically designed to identify sugar dating-related posts on social media.~SugarTextNet integrates a pretrained transformer encoder, an attention-based cue extractor, and a contextual phrase encoder to capture both salient and nuanced features in user-generated text.~To address class imbalance and enhance minority-class detection, we introduce Context-Aware Focal Loss, a tailored loss function that combines focal loss scaling with contextual weighting.~We evaluate SugarTextNet on a newly curated, manually annotated dataset of 3,067 Chinese social media posts from Sina Weibo, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms traditional machine learning models, deep learning baselines, and large language models across multiple metrics.~Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the indispensable role of each component.~Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific, context-aware modeling for sensitive content detection, and provide a robust solution for content moderation in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>When AI Agents Collude Online: Financial Fraud Risks by Collaborative LLM Agents on Social Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the risks of collective financial fraud in large-scale multi-agent systems powered by large language model (LLM) agents. We investigate whether agents can collaborate in fraudulent behaviors, how such collaboration amplifies risks, and what factors influence fraud success. To support this research, we present MultiAgentFraudBench, a large-scale benchmark for simulating financial fraud scenarios based on realistic online interactions. The benchmark covers 28 typical online fraud scenarios, spanning the full fraud lifecycle across both public and private domains. We further analyze key factors affecting fraud success, including interaction depth, activity level, and fine-grained collaboration failure modes. Finally, we propose a series of mitigation strategies, including adding content-level warnings to fraudulent posts and dialogues, using LLMs as monitors to block potentially malicious agents, and fostering group resilience through information sharing at the societal level. Notably, we observe that malicious agents can adapt to environmental interventions. Our findings highlight the real-world risks of multi-agent financial fraud and suggest practical measures for mitigating them.

      <title>Breaking the Dyadic Barrier: Rethinking Fairness in Link Prediction Beyond Demographic Parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Model for Improving Information Sharing among Cancer Care Groups using Software Engineering Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective treatment of cancer requires early diagnosis which involves the patient's awareness of the early signs and symptoms, leading to a consultation with a health provider, who would then promptly refer the patient for confirmation of the diagnosis and thereafter treatment. However, this is not always the case because of delays arising from limited skilled manpower and health information management systems that are neither integrated nor organized in their design hence leading to information gap among care groups. Existing methods focus on using accumulated data to support decision making, enhancing the sharing of secondary data while others exclude some critical stakeholders like patient caretakers and administrators thus, leaving an information gap that creates delays and miscommunication during case management. We however notice some similarities between cancer treatment and software engineering information management especially when progress history needs to be maintained (versioning).
  We analyze the similarities and propose a model for information sharing among cancer care groups using the software engineering principles approach. We model for reducing delays and improving coordination among care groups in cancer case management. Model design was guided by software engineering principles adopted in GitHub version control system for bug fixing in open-source code projects. Any-Logic simulation software was used to mimic the model realism in a virtual environment. Results show that bug resolution principles from software engineering and GitHub version control system can be adopted to coordinate collaboration and information sharing among care groups in a cancer case management environment while involving all stakeholders to improve care treatment outcomes, ensure early diagnosis and increase patient's survival chances.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Diffusion-Based Recommender Systems via Reinforcement Learning with Reward Function Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommender systems, offering state-of-the-art performance by modeling the generative process of user-item interactions. However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios. The source code and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFiT-4C60.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Policy Effects through Opinion Dynamics and Network Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the process of enacting or introducing a new policy, policymakers frequently consider the population's responses. These considerations are critical for effective governance. There are numerous methods to gauge the ground sentiment from a subset of the population; examples include surveys or listening to various feedback channels. Many conventional approaches implicitly assume that opinions are static; however, in reality, the population will discuss and debate these new policies among themselves, and reform new opinions in the process. In this paper, we pose the following questions: Can we quantify the effect of these social dynamics on the broader opinion towards a new policy? Given some information about the relationship network that underlies the population, how does overall opinion change post-discussion? We investigate three different settings in which the policy is revealed: respondents who do not know each other, groups of respondents who all know each other, and respondents chosen randomly. By controlling who the policy is revealed to, we control the degree of discussion among the population. We quantify how these factors affect the changes in policy beliefs via the Wasserstein distance between the empirically observed data post-discussion and its distribution pre-discussion. We also provide several numerical analyses based on generated network and real-life network datasets. Our work aims to address the challenges associated with network topology and social interactions, and provide policymakers with a quantitative lens to assess policy effectiveness in the face of resource constraints and network complexities.</description>

      <title>On the Cross-type Homophily of Heterogeneous Graphs: Understanding and Unleashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio (CHR), a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Additionally, we propose Cross-Type Homophily-guided Graph Editing (CTHGE), a novel method for improving heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) performance by optimizing cross-type connectivity using Cross-Type Homophily Ratio. Extensive experiments on five HG datasets with nine HGNNs validate the effectiveness of CTHGE, which delivers a maximum relative performance improvement of over 25% for HGNNs on node classification tasks, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in HGs learning.</description>

      <title>MindVote: When AI Meets the Wild West of Social Media Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14422v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scalable tools for pilot testing, predicting public opinion distributions before deploying costly surveys. To serve as effective pilot testing tools, the performance of these LLMs is typically benchmarked against their ability to reproduce the outcomes of past structured surveys. This evaluation paradigm, however, is misaligned with the dynamic, context-rich social media environments where public opinion is increasingly formed and expressed. By design, surveys strip away the social, cultural, and temporal context that shapes public opinion, and LLM benchmarks built on this paradigm inherit these critical limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce MindVote, the first benchmark for public opinion distribution prediction grounded in authentic social media discourse. MindVote is constructed from 3,918 naturalistic polls sourced from Reddit and Weibo, spanning 23 topics and enriched with detailed annotations for platform, topical, and temporal context. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs. MindVote provides a robust, ecologically valid framework to move beyond survey-based evaluations and advance the development of more socially intelligent AI systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating Prosocial Behavior Theory in LLM Agents under Policy-Induced Inequities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous agents in social contexts, evaluating their capacity for prosocial behavior is both theoretically and practically critical. However, existing research has primarily relied on static, economically framed paradigms, lacking models that capture the dynamic evolution of prosociality and its sensitivity to structural inequities. To address these gaps, we introduce ProSim, a simulation framework for modeling the prosocial behavior in LLM agents across diverse social conditions. We conduct three progressive studies to assess prosocial alignment. First, we demonstrate that LLM agents can exhibit human-like prosocial behavior across a broad range of real-world scenarios and adapt to normative policy interventions. Second, we find that agents engage in fairness-based third-party punishment and respond systematically to variations in inequity magnitude and enforcement cost. Third, we show that policy-induced inequities suppress prosocial behavior, propagate norm erosion through social networks. These findings advance prosocial behavior theory by elucidating how institutional dynamics shape the emergence, decay, and diffusion of prosocial norms in agent-driven societies.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Shared Knowledge: Recursive Belief Reasoning in a Coordination Game with Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common knowledge is crucial for safe group coordination. In its absence, humans must rely on shared knowledge, which is inherently limited in depth and therefore prone to coordination failures, because any finite-order knowledge attribution allows for an even higher order attribution that may change what is known by whom. In three separate experiments involving 802 participants, we investigate the extent to which humans can differentiate between common knowledge and nth-order shared knowledge. We designed a two-person coordination game with imperfect information to simplify the recursive game structure and higher-order uncertainties into a relatable everyday scenario. In this game, coordination for the highest payoff requires a specific fact to be common knowledge between players. However, this fact cannot become common knowledge in the game. The fact can at most be nth-order shared knowledge for some n. Our findings reveal that even at quite shallow depths of shared knowledge (low values of n), players behave as though they possess common knowledge, and claim similar levels of certainty in their actions, despite incurring significant penalties when falsely assuming guaranteed coordination. We term this phenomenon 'the curse of shared knowledge'. It arises either from the players' inability to distinguish between higher-order shared knowledge and common knowledge, or from their implicit assumption that their co-player cannot make this distinction.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg--Landau Functionals in the Large-Graph Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ginzburg--Landau (GL) functionals on graphs, which are relaxations of graph-cut functionals on graphs, have yielded a variety of insights in image segmentation and graph clustering. In this paper, we study large-graph limits of GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal kernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL functional $\GL^{W_n}_\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL functionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called graphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional $\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the \emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of the graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a nonlocal total-variation (TV) functional. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of Young measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the variational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition about the graphon GL functional, we determine the GL minimizer for several example families of graphons.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>
