      <title>Decomposition of entropy production for free-energy generation in a non-equilibrium dot with multiple electron states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the decomposition of entropy production during free-energy generation in a nanometer-scale dot transitioning to a non-equilibrium steady state via single-electron counting statistics. An alternating-current signal driving a reservoir that injects multiple electrons into the dot makes it non-equilibrium, leading to free-energy generation, heat dissipation, and Shannon-entropy production. By analyzing the time-domain probability distributions of multiple electron states of the dot, we quantitatively decompose the heat dissipation into housekeeping and excess heats, revealing the correlation between the free energy and the decomposed components of heat dissipation. This correlation suggests that the ratio of the generated free energy to the work applied to the dot, can potentially reach 0.5 under far-from-equilibrium conditions induced by a large signal, while an efficiency of 0.25 was experimentally achieved. Our results, providing the theoretical and experimental efficiencies from the relation between decomposed heat dissipation and free-energy generation, promise to connect non-equilibrium thermodynamics perspectives to electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-types of Instability Process of Periodic Orbits in Nonlinear Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear normal modes are periodic orbits that survive in nonlinear many-body Hamiltonian systems, and their instability plays a key role in the system's relaxation dynamics. We investigate here the instability of the $\pi/3$-mode in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\alpha$ chain with fixed boundary conditions. We find that three types of bifurcations -- period-doubling, tangent, and Hopf bifurcations -- coexist in this system, each driving instability at specific reduced wave-number $\tilde{k}$. Our analysis reveals a universal scaling law for the instability time $\mathcal{T} \propto (\lambda - \lambda_{\rm c})^{-1/2}$, independent of bifurcation types and models, where the critical perturbation strength $\lambda_{\rm c}$ depends on $\tilde{k}$ via $\lambda_{\rm c} \propto (\tilde{k} - \tilde{k}_{\rm c})$, with $\tilde{k}_{\rm c}$ varying across bifurcations. We also observe a double instability phenomenon for certain system sizes. These results provide new insights into the relaxation and thermalization dynamics in many-body systems, with broad implications for nonlinear and non-equilibrium statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Universality of the complete-graph Potts model with $0&lt; q \leq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universality is a fundamental concept in modern physics. For the $q$-state Potts model, the critical exponents are merely determined by the order-parameter symmetry $S_q$, spatial dimensionality and interaction range, independent of microscopic details. In a simplest and mean-field treatment--i.e., the Potts model on complete graph (CG), the phase transition is further established to be of percolation universality for the range of $0 &lt; q &lt;2$. By simulating the CG Potts model in the random-cluster representation, we numerically demonstrate such a hyper-universality that the critical exponents are the same for $0&lt; q &lt;2$ and, moreover, the Ising system ($q = 2$) exhibits a variety of critical geometric properties in percolation universality. On the other hand, many other universal properties in the finite-size scaling (FSS) theory, including Binder-like ratios and distribution function of the order parameter, are observed to be $q$-dependent. Our finding provides valuable insights for the study of critical phenomena in finite spatial dimensions, particularly when the FSS theory is utilized.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Critical gate distance for Wigner crystallization in the two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas in a dual-gate geometry, using quantum Monte Carlo methods to obtain aspects of the phase diagram as a function of electron density and gate distance. We identify the critical gate distance below which the Wigner crystal phase disappears. For larger gate distances, the system undergoes a re-entrant transition from crystal to liquid at sufficiently low density. We also present preliminary evidence for a fully polarized ferromagnetic liquid state at low electron density and intermediate gate distances. The quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with simpler approximate methods, which are shown to be semi-quantitatively reliable for determining key features of the phase diagram. These methods are then used to obtain the phase boundary between the Wigner crystal and liquid in the single-gate geometry.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian renormalisation group and thermal field theory in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study perturbative Wilsonian renormalisation group (RG) for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory at finite temperature to one loop order in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path (CTP) formalism. By explicitly integrating out the UV modes, we show how effective interactions coupling the two branches of the CTP contour arise. This provides a microscopic derivation of the type of effective CTP actions used in the literature. While the full effective theory has no critical points, we instead proceed to study critical properties of the RG flow in a reduced space of complex couplings that characterise certain time-ordered correlators and show the existence of two novel fixed points in $d=4$ spacetime dimensions. We relate one to the Wilson-Fished fixed point known to exist only in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, and the other to the standard Gaussian fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the Kelvin-Voigt model in order to include and characterize heterogeneities in viscoelastic semisolid materials. By considering a microrheological approach, we present analytical expressions for the mean square displacement and for the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of probe particles immersed in a viscoelastic material described by this model. Besides validating our theoretical approach through Brownian dynamics simulations, we show how the model can be used to describe experimental data obtained for polyacrylamide and laponite gels.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general protocol for engineering dissipative time crystals in quantum open systems through symmetry-induced fragmentation and ergodicity breaking. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we devise a generic Liouvillian possessing a series of non-dissipative eigenmodes with purely imaginary eigenvalues, which give rise to long-time oscillations breaking both ergodicity and time-translation symmetry. Illustrating our proposal using a dissipative lattice model, we show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. The richly structured prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model, under which excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group. The branching rules of the permutation group then dictate that the Liouvillian gaps acquired by the non-dissipative eigenmodes should be higher-order powers of the symmetry-breaking perturbation, protecting the prethermal time crystal.</description>

      <title>Convection-modulated topological edge mode and extended-localized criticality in thermal metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection offers a dynamic and flexible approach to achieving a variety of novel physical phenomena beyond pure conduction. Here, we demonstrate that thermal metamaterials with convection modulation enable the realization of non-Hermitian topological edge modes and bulk mode criticality. We illustrate that a periodic modulation can induce localized edge modes within the band gap. The temperature field of the topological state is localized at the edge rings, decaying exponentially at a fixed rate. Additionally, we introduce an extended-localized criticality through the quasiperiodic convection modulation in thermotics. The convections have an advantage of fantastic tunability in the application. Our work proposes a scheme for implementing topological modes and bulk mode criticality through modulating convection in diffusion systems, paving the way for the design of reconfigurable thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Trends and Reversion in Financial Markets on Time Scales from Minutes to Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We empirically analyze the reversion of financial market trends with time horizons ranging from minutes to decades. The analysis covers equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities and combines 14 years of futures tick data, 30 years of daily futures prices, 330 years of monthly asset prices, and yearly financial data since medieval times.
  Across asset classes, we find that markets are in a trending regime on time scales that range from a few hours to a few years, while they are in a reversion regime on shorter and longer time scales. In the trending regime, weak trends tend to persist, which can be explained by herding behavior of investors. However, in this regime trends tend to revert before they become strong enough to be statistically significant, which can be interpreted as a return of asset prices to their intrinsic value. In the reversion regime, we find the opposite pattern: weak trends tend to revert, while those trends that become statistically significant tend to persist.
  Our results provide a set of empirical tests of theoretical models of financial markets. We interpret them in the light of a recently proposed lattice gas model, where the lattice represents the social network of traders, the gas molecules represent the shares of financial assets, and efficient markets correspond to the critical point. If this model is accurate, the lattice gas must be near this critical point on time scales from 1 hour to a few days, with a correlation time of a few years.</description>

      <title>Networks of neural networks: more is different</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum many-body dynamics using subsystem Loschmidt echos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo - the probability of a quantum many-body system to return to its initial state following a dynamical evolution - generally contains key information about a quantum system, relevant across various scientific fields including quantum chaos, quantum many-body physics, or high-energy physics. However, it is typically exponentially small in system size, posing an outstanding challenge for experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the subsystem Loschmidt echo, a quasi-local observable that captures key features of the Loschmidt echo while being readily accessible experimentally. Utilizing quantum gas microscopy, we study its short- and long-time dynamics. In the short-time regime, we observe a dynamical quantum phase transition arising from genuine higher-order correlations. In the long-time regime, the subsystem Loschmidt echo allows us to quantitatively determine the effective dimension and structure of the accessible Hilbert space in the thermodynamic limit. Performing these measurements in the ergodic regime and in the presence of emergent kinetic constraints, we provide direct experimental evidence for ergodicity breaking due to fragmentation of the Hilbert space. Our results establish the subsystem Loschmidt echo as a novel and powerful tool that allows paradigmatic studies of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-body systems, applicable to a broad range of quantum simulation and computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rivers are well-known to exhibit fractal-like properties that lead to existence of scaling laws that link network geometry and size. However, these geometric relations might not necessarily capture the spatial features that most directly influence ecological processes such as the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Connectivity metrics, on the other hand, have been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes. Therefore, in this work, we establish how river network connectivity scales with system size by analyzing networks obtained for more than 1000 rivers across the globe. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the Harmonic and Betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. We then created a synthetic river network dataset by fitting an Optimal Channel Network (OCN) model to each real river, to ask if OCNs, which are widely used to represent rivers in many theoretical studies, exhibit the same connectivity scaling laws as empirical river networks. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws by varying species movement strategies from perfect shortest-path navigation to unbiased random walks. Surprisingly, we found that random walk movement breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic, but not for betweenness centrality.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.</description>

      <title>Geospatial distributions reflect rates of evolution of features of language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the speed of linguistic change is challenging due to the fact that the historical evolution of languages is sparsely documented. Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leaves a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.</description>

      <title>Universal trade-off structure between symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence in quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence are foundational concepts in physics. Here, we present a universal tradeoff relation between these three concepts. This particularly reveals that (1) under a global symmetry, any attempt to change the local conserved charge causes inevitable irreversibility, and (2) such irreversibility can be mitigated by quantum coherence. Our tradeoff relation follows solely from the unitarity and global symmetry of the total dynamics, allowing for general applicability. For non-equilibrium physics, it relates the coherence cost and the entropy production -- representing thermodynamic irreversibility -- in arbitrary quantum processes. It also provides fundamental limitations on the capability of a number of quantum information processing tasks -- such as gate and measurement implementation and error correction -- that involve symmetry restrictions. Furthermore, it predicts how many bits of classical information thrown into a black hole become unreadable under energy conservation. Our tradeoff relation is based on quantum uncertainty relation, showcasing intimate connections between fundamental physical principles and ultimate operational capability of quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport for Simple Fluids in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the state-of-the-art theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and coarse-graining strategies for the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size 1-100 nm). Special emphasis is placed on the transport of small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal-organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We present different atomistic and mesoscopic methods as well as the theoretical formalisms. Attention is given to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies. This review focuses on simple fluids in prototypical nanoporous materials. While the phenomena covered here capture the main physical mechanisms in such systems, complex molecules will exhibit additional specific features. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we also omit multicomponent systems (e.g. fluid mixtures, electrolytes, etc.) and electrokinetic effects arising when charged systems are considered (ionic species, charged surfaces, etc.), both of which add to the complexity.</description>

      <title>Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts.
  The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling (TPS), has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. To account for this memory effect, we introduce a theoretical framework based on an extended ensemble that includes both paths and shooting indices. We derive appropriate acceptance rules for various path sampling algorithms in this extended formalism, ensuring the correct sampling of the transition path ensemble. Our framework reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible-length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.</description>

      <title>Precisely controlled colloids: A playground for path-wise non-equilibrium physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate path-wise observables in experiments on driven colloids in a periodic light field to dissect selected intricate transport features, kinetics, and transition-path time statistics out of thermodynamic equilibrium. These observables directly reflect the properties of individual paths in contrast to the properties of an ensemble of particles, such as radial distribution functions or mean-squared displacements. In particular, we present two distinct albeit equivalent formulations of the underlying stochastic equation of motion, highlight their respective practical relevance, and show how to interchange between them. We discuss conceptually different notions of local velocities and interrogate one- and two-sided first-passage and transition-path time statistics in and out of equilibrium. Our results reiterate how path-wise observables may be employed to systematically assess the quality of experimental data and demonstrate that, given sufficient control and sampling, one may quantitatively verify subtle theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interaction in the Mpemba effect in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.</description>

      <title>Melting through Barrier-Crossing: The Role of Equilibrium Thermally Activated Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Melting is often understood in purely equilibrium terms, where crystalline order disappears once the free energy of the solid equals that of the liquid. Yet at the microscopic level, the initiating events for melting can often be traced to the formation of defects or local ``jumps'' over interatomic barriers. In this work, we offer a unified interpretation of melting by focusing on the equilibrium fraction of particles whose energy exceeds a characteristic barrier \(E_a\). We show that when this fraction surpasses a small but critical threshold \cite{Feder1958,Kraftmakher1998} (on the order of \(10^{-4}\)-\(10^{-3}\)), the crystal loses its rigidity, thus reconciling Born's mechanical-instability picture with the older Lindemann notion of large atomic displacements. We derive this threshold condition from standard Boltzmann (and Bose/Fermi) statistics, ensuring consistency with standard thermodynamics. Our approach naturally extends to vortex lattices in superconductors (where vortex activation energies play the role of \(E_a\)) and to quantum-lattice systems (Hubbard-type models). Crucially, while the interpretation emphasizes barrier crossing, the criterion itself is built on equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a transparent link between defect formation rates and the macroscopic transition.</description>
