      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Lane Changing of Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning field of autonomous driving necessitates the seamless integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with human-driven vehicles, calling for more predictable AV behavior and enhanced interaction with human drivers. Human-like driving, particularly during lane-changing maneuvers on highways, is a critical area of research due to its significant impact on safety and traffic flow. Traditional rule-based decision-making approaches often fail to encapsulate the nuanced boundaries of human behavior in diverse driving scenarios, while crafting reward functions for learning-based methods introduces its own set of complexities. This study investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to emulate human-like lane-changing decisions in AVs. An initial RL policy is pre-trained to ensure safe lane changes. Subsequently, this policy is employed to gather data, which is then annotated by humans to train a reward model that discerns lane changes aligning with human preferences. This human-informed reward model supersedes the original, guiding the refinement of the policy to reflect human-like preferences. The effectiveness of RLHF in producing human-like lane changes is demonstrated through the development and evaluation of conservative and aggressive lane-changing models within obstacle-rich environments and mixed autonomy traffic scenarios. The experimental outcomes underscore the potential of RLHF to diversify lane-changing behaviors in AVs, suggesting its viability for enhancing the integration of AVs into the fabric of human-driven traffic.</description>

      <title>Evaluating diversion and treatment policies for opioid use disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The United States (US) opioid crisis contributed to 81,806 fatalities in 2022. It has strained hospitals, treatment facilities, and law enforcement agencies due to the enormous resources and procedures needed to respond to the crisis. As a result, many individuals who use opioids never receive or finish the treatment they need and instead have many interactions with hospitals or the criminal justice system. This paper introduces a discrete event simulation model that evaluates three opioid use disorder treatment policies: arrest diversion, re-entry case management, and overdose diversion. Publicly available data from 2011 to 2019 in Dane County, Wisconsin, was used to forecast opioid-related outcomes through 2032. Through analyzing a variety of policy-mix implementations, the study offers a versatile framework for evaluating policies at various implementation levels. The results demonstrate that treatment policies that create new pathways and programming by utilizing treatment services and successfully divert at least 20% of eligible individuals can lead to more opioid-resilient communities. The benefits increase when more policies are enacted and/or offered to more individuals, with the largest impact from overdose diversion, followed by re-entry case management, and the smallest impact from arrest diversion. The cumulative total reduction in societal costs from 2017 to 2032 ranges from \$68 M (USD) to \$1.06 B (USD), excluding implementation costs of policies. To reverse the opioid crisis within a community, treatment policies may need to be combined with other strategies, such as harm reduction, supply reduction, and use prevention.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Language and Graph Learning of Adsorption Configuration in Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a reactivity descriptor that must be accurately predicted for effective machine learning (ML) application in catalyst screening. This process involves determining the lowest energy across various adsorption configurations on a catalytic surface, which can exhibit very similar energy values. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in computing the energy of catalyst systems, they rely heavily on atomic spatial coordinates. In contrast, transformer-based language models can directly use human-readable text inputs, potentially bypassing the need for detailed atomic positions. However, these language models often struggle with accurately predicting the energy of adsorption configurations. Our study addresses this limitation by introducing a self-supervised multi-modal learning approach called graph-assisted pretraining, which connects well-established GNNs with emerging language model applications. This method reduces the MAE of energy prediction for adsorption configurations by about 10%. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that graph-assisted pretraining enhances fine-tuning with different datasets, indicating the transferability of this approach. This method also redirects the model's attention toward adsorption configuration, rather than individual adsorbate and catalyst information, similar to common domain knowledge. Building on this, we propose using generative large language models to create text inputs for the predictive model, based solely on chemical composition and surface orientation, without relying on exact atomic positions. This demonstrates a potential use case of language models in energy prediction without geometric information.</description>

      <title>An approximate block factorization preconditioner for mixed-dimensional beam-solid interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a scalable physics-based block preconditioner for mixed-dimensional models in beam-solid interaction and their application in engineering. In particular, it studies the linear systems arising from a regularized mortar-type approach for embedding geometrically exact beams into solid continua. Due to the lack of block diagonal dominance of the arising 2 x 2 block system, an approximate block factorization preconditioner is used. It exploits the sparsity structure of the beam sub-block to construct a sparse approximate inverse, which is then not only used to explicitly form an approximation of the Schur complement, but also acts as a smoother within the prediction step of the arising SIMPLE-type preconditioner. The correction step utilizes an algebraic multigrid method. Although, for now, the beam sub-block is tackled by a one-level method only, the multi-level nature of the computationally demanding correction step delivers a scalable preconditioner in practice. In numerical test cases, the influence of different algorithmic parameters on the quality of the sparse approximate inverse is studied and the weak scaling behavior of the proposed preconditioner on up to 1000 MPI ranks is demonstrated, before the proposed preconditioner is finally applied for the analysis of steel-reinforced concrete structures in civil engineering.</description>

      <title>FSGe: A fast and strongly-coupled 3D fluid-solid-growth interaction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrated fluid-solid-growth (FSGe) is a fast, open source, three-dimensional (3D) computational platform for simulating interactions between instantaneous hemodynamics and long-term vessel wall adaptation through mechanobiologically equilibrated growth and remodeling (G&amp;R). Such models can capture evolving geometry, composition, and material properties in health and disease and following clinical interventions. In traditional G&amp;R models, this feedback is modeled through highly simplified fluid solutions, neglecting local variations in blood pressure and wall shear stress (WSS). FSGe overcomes these inherent limitations by strongly coupling the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for blood flow with a 3D equilibrated constrained mixture model (CMMe) for vascular tissue G&amp;R. CMMe allows one to predict long-term evolved mechanobiological equilibria from an original homeostatic state at a computational cost equivalent to that of a standard hyperelastic material model. In illustrative computational examples, we focus on the development of a stable aortic aneurysm in a mouse model to highlight key differences in growth patterns between FSGe and solid-only G&amp;R models. We show that FSGe is especially important in blood vessels with asymmetric stimuli. Simulation results reveal greater local variation in fluid-derived WSS than in intramural stress (IMS). Thus, differences between FSGe and G&amp;R models became more pronounced with the growing influence of WSS relative to pressure. Future applications in highly localized disease processes, such as for lesion formation in atherosclerosis, can now include spatial and temporal variations of WSS.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across a spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, we assess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handling complex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.</description>
