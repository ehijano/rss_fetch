      <title>Sub-Snowline Formation of Gas-Giant Planets in Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets are thought to build their cores beyond the snow line, where water ice solids catalyze efficient planetary core growth \citep{Pollack1996, Armitage2024}. In close binary star systems, however, the companion star's gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable \citep[]{Holman1999}, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form. Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393 binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify 19 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population, making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the protoplanetary disk and creates a pressure bump and effective dust trap that facilitates the formation of gas giants. Using this model, we can successfully predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties. Moreover, the main inconsistent outliers from these predictions are found to be evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars), further supporting the model and pointing to these being second-generation planets. Our results have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the role of trap-dusts in their formation.</description>

      <title>Exogeological inferences from white dwarf pollutants: the impact of stellar physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many white dwarfs have accreted material from their own planetary systems. These objects can be used to infer the composition of exoplanetary material and identify evidence for key geological processes. However, the white dwarf atmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the true composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted metals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various physical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on the effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline mixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated atmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete treatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in accreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including thermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems, the effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the overall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available grids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a large impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the inferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material. We identify several systems for which the geological interpretation is robust against these systematics. We also present a `discrepancy metric' which can be used to estimate the potential impact of changing the stellar physics without requiring detailed modelling.</description>

      <title>Clouds as the driver of variability and colour changes in brown dwarf atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are massive, giant exoplanet analogues subject to variability and colour changes, known as the L/T transition, fundamental for their thermal evolution. The drivers of the L/T transition remain elusive, with atmospheric circulations and/or clouds usually suggested as potential mechanisms. Using a three-dimensional Global Climate Model including cloud formation, transport and multi-wavelength radiative effects, we show that clouds play a major role in shaping the atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs. Cloud radiative effect, which triggers atmospheric convection, leads to spectral, spatial, and temporal variability in the modelled brown dwarfs, in agreement with the observed variability and L/T transition. Low latitudes are subject to sustained wave activity, whereas eddies dominate higher latitudes. Our results highlight that the role of clouds as a driver of atmospheric dynamics and climate, well known for giant exoplanets, extends to all sub-stellar bodies.</description>

      <title>The Atmospheric Composition of Sub-Neptune K2-18 b and Implications for its Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlocking the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes is among JWST's major achievements, yet such observations demand complex analyses that strongly affect interpretations. We present an independent reanalysis of the original JWST transmission spectrum of K2-18 b, to assess the robustness of previously claimed detections, explore the parameter space, and implications for its formation. The observations were reduced using a combination of public and customized pipelines producing a total of 12 different versions of the transmission spectrum by varying: spectral binning, limb-darkening, and a novel correction for the occulted stellar spot. We then performed atmospheric retrievals using TauREx 3, comparing models of varying complexity, robustly detecting CH$_4$ (3-4$\sigma$) across all configurations. The evidence for CO$_2$ is weaker and highly model-dependent. The tentative detection of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) vanishes in our most comprehensive retrieval models. We find that correcting the stellar spot in the NIRISS transit is a critical step, introducing a uniform offset that primarily drives the inference of a lower mean molecular weight atmosphere. Furthermore, the assumed complexity of the retrieval model itself introduces significant biases; including more molecules systematically increases the retrieved CH$_4$ abundance and atmospheric mean molecular weight, even for species without spectral features. The data are consistent with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with an elevated O and an even more elevated C abundance, leading to a super-solar C/O. We show that the physical properties of the system planets K2-18 c, and K2-18 b are consistent with those expected by the in situ formation theory of Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF), interior to the carbon "soot" line, where an elevated C/O ratio of a primordial atmosphere is expected to be inherited from the protoplanetary disk.</description>

      <title>A Physical Model for the Ice Coma of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025 revealed a pronounced sunward anti-tail with a projected 2:1 elongation that our earlier study suggests is dominated by scattering off grains of H$_2$O ice ejected from the nucleus by CO$_2$ sublimation. Subsequent observations with the Keck and Gemini South observatories showed a reduction in the anti-tail and the growth of a conventional tail in a direction away from the sun. In this study we explain the physics behind this evolution. As a function of heliocentric distance, we model the apparent visual brightness of scattering in the ice coma. As the comet approaches the Sun, the exponential temperature dependence of the sublimation rate causes a continuous increase in the production rate of ice grains and a sharp decline in their residence time within the observing aperture. The combined effects produce a peak in total scattering cross-section due to H$_2$O ice grains at 3-4 AU. At closer distances, the scattering becomes dominated by longer-lived refractory and larger volatile grains with survival times long enough to form a conventional tail.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of planetary migration: Resonance crossing and planetesimal ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary migration is a crucial stage in the early solar system, explaining many observational phenomena and providing constraints on details related to the solar system's origins. This paper aims to investigate the acceleration during planetary migration in detail using numerical simulations, delving deeper into the early solar system's preserved information. We confirm that planetary migration is a positive feedback process: the faster the migration, the more efficient the consumption of planetesimals; once the migration slows down, Neptune clears the surrounding space, making further migration more difficult to sustain. Quantitatively, a tenfold increase in migration rate corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in the mass of planetesimals consumed to increase per unit angular momentum of Neptune. We also find that Neptune's final position is correlated with the initial surface density of planetesimals at that location, suggesting that the disk density at 30au was approximately 0.009$M_{\oplus}/au^2$ in the early solar system. Two mechanisms that can accelerate planetary migration are identified: the first is MMR between Uranus and Neptune. Migration acceleration will be triggered whenever these two giant planets cross their major MMR. The second mechanism is the ring structure within the planetesimal disk, as the higher planetesimal density in this region can provide the material support necessary for migration acceleration. Our research indicates that Neptune in the current solar system occupies a relatively delicate position. In case Neptune crossed the 1:2 MMR with Uranus, it could have migrated to a much more distant location. Therefore, under the influence of the positive feedback mechanism, the evolution of the solar system to its current configuration might be a stochastic outcome rather than an inevitable consequence.</description>

      <title>Locked In Ice: how Pebble Drift and Volatile Entrapment can Significantly Impact Carbon and Oxygen Ratios in Evolving Protoplanetary Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex interplay between the growth, drift, and sublimation of ice-covered pebbles can strongly influence the volatile distribution and evolution of disc composition, and therefore impact the composition of forming planets. Classic pebble drift models treat volatile species individually as sublimating at their respective snowlines, although observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that ices are likely mixed; laboratory studies suggest ice mixtures can exhibit more complex sublimation behaviours, remaining trapped beyond their nominal sublimation temperatures. We present the first model that couples pebble growth and drift with CO entrapment inside water ice - preventing a fraction (up to ~60%) of the CO from sublimating at its snowline, instead desorbing via volcanic desorption at the water crystallisation front, at 130K. Our models show that CO entrapment will significantly impact the carbon and oxygen distributions, enhancing the gas-phase C/O and C/H inside the water snowline by up to a factor of 10 over 1 Myr and a factor of a few around the CO2 snowline; O/H is also increased around the CO2 snowline, but is water-dominated in the inner disc. Entrapment therefore provides a means of introducing more carbon to the inner disc whilst retaining a large amount of water. We discuss connections to planet formation, noting that CO entrapment can increase the gas-phase heavy element content around the water snowline by up to 150%. We also consider links to JWST observations and highlight the importance of entrapment for pebble drift models to accurately model disc composition.</description>

      <title>Diurnal temperature variations and migrating thermal tides in the Martian lower atmosphere observed by the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Martian atmosphere experiences large diurnal variations due to the ~24.6 h planetary rotation and its low heat capacity. Understanding such variations on a planetary scale is limited due to the lack of observations, which are greatly addressed with the recent advent of the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM). As a result of its unique high-altitude orbit, instruments onboard are capable of obtaining a full geographic and local time coverage of the Martian atmosphere every 9-10 Martian days, approximately ~5{\deg} in solar longitude (LS). This enables investigations of the diurnal variation of the current climate on Mars on a planetary scale without significant local time (LT) gaps or confusions from correlated seasonal variations. Here, we present the results of diurnal temperature variations and thermal tides in the Martian atmosphere using temperature profiles retrieved from the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer (EMIRS) observations. The data during the primary mission is included, covering an entire Martian Year (MY) starting from MY 36 LS = 49{\deg}. The diurnal temperature patterns suggest a dominant diurnal tide in most seasons, while the semi-diurnal tide presents a similar amplitude near perihelion. The seasonal variation of the diurnal tide latitudinal distribution is well explained by the total vorticity due to zonal wind, while that of the semi-diurnal tide following both dust and water ice clouds, and the ter-diurnal tide following the dust only. Comparison with the updated Mars Planetary Climate Model (PCM, version 6) suggest improvements in simulating the dust and water cycles, as well as their radiative processes.</description>

      <title>Chemistry, Climate, and Transmission Spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e Explored with a Multimodel Sparse Sampled Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 e is one of a few habitable zone exoplanets that is amenable to characterization in the near term. In this study our motivations are both scientific and technical. Our technical goal is to establish a multimodel sparse sampled ensemble approach for coherently exploring large unconstrained parameter spaces typical in exoplanet science. Our science goal is to determine relationships that connect observations to the underlying climate across a large parameter space of atmospheric compositions for TRAPPIST-1 e. We consider atmospheric compositions of N2, CO2, CH4, and H2O, with water clouds and photochemical hazes. We use a 1D photochemical model, a 3D climate model, and a transmission spectral model, filtered through a quasi-Monte Carlo sparse sampling approach applied across atmospheric compositions. While clouds and hazes have significant effects on the transmission spectra, CO2 and CH4 can be potentially detected in &lt;10 transits for certain compositional and climate states. Colder climates have better prospects for characterization, due to being relatively dry and having fewer clouds, permitting transmission observations to probe more deeply into their atmospheres. CH4 volume mixing ratios of &gt;$10^{-3}$ trigger strong antigreenhouse cooling, where near-IR absorption simultaneously creates an inversion in the stratosphere and reduces the stellar radiation reaching the planet surface. In such cases, interpreting the disk-averaged emission and albedo at face value can yield misleading conclusions, as here low albedo and high thermal emission are associated with cold planets. Future work will use our sparse sampling approach to explore broader parameter spaces and other observationally amenable exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion Development of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe pre-perihelion optical observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken during July - September 2025 using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.</description>

      <title>Ever Elusive Exospheres: One Probable Detection and Two Non-Detections of H{\alpha} Transits in Young Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaps in the exoplanet population, such as the Neptunian Desert, point to the importance of mass-loss in sculpting the radii of close-in exoplanets. Young planets ($&lt;$500Myr) offer the opportunity to detect such mass-loss while it is still strong, and to test models of the underlying physical processes. We search for evidence of an H$\alpha$ transit in high-resolution spectra of three young planets, HD 63433b (400 Myr), DS TucAb (45 Myr), and HIP 67522b (17 Myr) using HARPS-N, Magellan-PFS, and CHIRON respectively. We validate our method by testing it on several photospheric lines less impacted by stellar variability. We find no evidence of a transit signal for HD 63433b and DS Tuc A b (3$\sigma$ limits of 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively). For HIP 67522b, we detect significant excess absorption (3.44$\pm$0.28%) aligned with the transit time, narrow compared to the stellar line, and blueshifted from the stellar rest frame. In combination, these suggest the signal is from the planet. However, stellar variation in the H$\alpha$ line over the course of the observations is comparable in size to the transit signature and the duration is shorter than the photometric transit, so this detection requires confirmation. Our findings, and other recent results in the literature, suggest that planets younger than 50 Myr are more favorable for the detection of atmospheric escape with H$\alpha$ observations, though older populations might still show escape in other diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Effective Search for Extraterrestrial Probes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For centuries, astronomers have discussed the possibility of inhabited worlds - from Herschel's 18th-century observations suggesting Mars may host life, to the systematic search for technosignatures that began in the 1960s using radio telescopes. Searching for artifacts in the solar system has received relatively little formal scientific interest and has faced significant technical and social challenges. Automated surveys and new observational techniques developed over the past decade now enable astronomers to survey parts of the sky for anomalous objects.
  We briefly describe four methods for detecting extraterrestrial artifacts and probes within the Solar System and then focus on demonstrating one of these. The first makes use of pre-Sputnik images to search for flashes from glinting objects. The second method makes use of space-borne telescopes to search for artificial objects. A third approach involves examining the reflectance spectra of objects in Earth orbit, in search of the characteristic reddening that may imply long-term exposure of metallic surfaces to space weathering. We focus here on a fourth approach, which involves using Earth's shadow as a filter when searching for optically luminous objects in near-Earth space. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this method by conducting two searches for transients in images acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has generated many repeated 30-second exposures of the same fields.
  In this way, we identified previously uncatalogued events at short angular separations from the center of the shadow, motivating more extensive searches using this technique. We conclude that the Earth's shadow presents a new and exciting search domain for near-Earth SETI.</description>

      <title>Exploring Giant Planet Atmospheres with Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>

Abstract: Visible and ultraviolet imaging and spectroscopy of Solar System giant planets can set the paradigm for the atmospheric, ionospheric, and magnetospheric processes shaping the diversity of giant exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and their interactions with stellar hosts. Spectra of their molecular absorptions, aerosol scattering, airglow, and auroral emissions can reveal these dynamic atmospheres in three dimensions. Given that giant planets are extended, bright, moving, and rotating objects, with extreme dynamic range and highly variable appearances, they impose specific mission and instrumentation requirements on future large space-based optical/UV observatories like the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We advocate that HWO must have the capability to track non-sidereal targets like the giant planets and their satellites; should be able to view auroras and atmospheres without saturation (e.g., through the use of filters or fast read-out modes); and with a high dynamic range to explore faint objects near bright discs. HWO should enable spatially-resolved spectroscopy from $\sim80$ nm to $\sim900$ nm, capturing H$_2$ Lyman and Werner band series and H Lyman-$\alpha$ in the far-UV; molecular absorptions and scattering in the mid-UV/visible; and deep hydrogen/methane absorptions in the 800-900 nm for cloud characterisation and CH$_4$ mapping. Imaging should enable time-resolved observations, from seconds to create auroral movies, to hours for cloud tracking and winds, to months and years for atmosphere/ionosphere variability. We advocate that an imager should have sufficient field of view to capture Jupiter ($&gt;50$\arcsec), and that UV/visible integral field spectrographs be considered with both narrow ($3$\arcsec) and wide ($&gt;10$\arcsec) field capabilities to provide efficient mapping of atmospheres and auroras.

      <title>Comission Femmes et Astronomie de la SF2A : Women participation in french astronomy 2025</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Commission Femmes et Astronomie of the French Astronomical Society, has conducted a statistical study aimed at mapping the current presence of women in French professional astronomy and establishing a baseline for tracking its evolution over time. This study follows an initial survey carried out in 2021, which covered eight astronomy and astrophysics institutes (1,060 employees). This year, the scope was expanded to 11 institutes, bringing together a total of 1,525 employees, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, academics, as well as technical and administrative staff, representing about 57% of the whole French community. We examined how the proportion of women varies according to career stage, level of responsibility, job security, and income. The results are compared to the 2021-2022 survey and appear to illustrate the well-known "leaky pipeline", with one of the main bottlenecks being access to permanent positions. The study shows that the proportion of women consistently declines with increasing job security, career seniority, qualification level, and salary.</description>

      <title>Looking for Companionship: Radial Velocity Follow-Up of Lithium-Rich Giants with ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-rich red giants have been a long-standing mystery in stellar astrophysics. A leading theory to explain these chemically peculiar and rare objects is interactions with a close companion. To investigate their companion fraction, we collected high-resolution spectra of 33 Li-rich red giants using ESPRESSO, and used The Joker constrain their orbital parameters. We find an overall companion rate of $27\%$ (9/33). Secondary masses reveal one planetary companion ($ M\sin i \approx 7 \; \rm M_{Jup}$), three brown dwarfs ($ M\sin i=30-33 \; \rm M_{Jup}$), and five stellar-mass companions ($M\sin i= 0.2-0.8 \;\rm M_\odot$). Our findings suggest that Li-rich red giants with lower lithium abundance ($\rm A(Li) \approx 1.5 \; dex$) tend to be in binaries as compared to those with higher lithium abundance, and Li-rich red giants with $\log g = 2-3 \rm \; dex$ have a higher companion rate than those outside of this range. We offer two potential formation mechanisms of our Li-rich sample: (i) the progenitor mass of stellar mass companions suggest that these objects were potentially lithium-producing, intermediate-mass AGB stars; (ii) the sub-stellar companions were initially in multi-planet systems, but dynamical instability caused the tidal dissipation of close-in planets thereby enhancing the red giant in lithium. Extended baselines and dedicated follow-up with Gaia DR4 astrometry are required to confirm the orbital parameters of our systems and distinguish between mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of the light-polluted night sky in Hong Kong</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic study of the night sky has been a common way to assess the impacts of artificial light at night at remote astronomical observatories. However, the spectroscopic properties of the urban night sky remain poorly documented. We addressed this gap by collecting more than 12,000 zenith sky spectra with compact spectrometers at urban and suburban sites from 2021 to 2023. Here, by examining the intensity variations of the spectral features that represent characteristic emissions from common artificial light sources, we show that the skyglow is predominantly shaped by artificial emissions, including compact fluorescent lamps and high-pressure sodium lamps. Contributions from commercially controlled lighting, including those for floodlighting and advertising adopting light-emitting diode and metal halide technologies, were more pronounced in urban areas during the hours leading up to midnight. We also documented direct evidence of the impact of a neon sign located on top of a commercial tower, illustrating how a single light source can significantly influence the surrounding environment. Compared with observations made a decade ago at the same location, our findings indicate a growing popularity of light-emitting diode lighting for external use, consistent with the existing literature. This first comprehensive spectroscopic investigation of light pollution in an urban environment emphasizes the evolving patterns of outdoor lighting and highlights the critical and unique role of spectroscopic measurements. The results provide essential information for the development of effective strategies and policies to mitigate light pollution in urban areas and at sites of astronomical importance.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF-11: A New Zodiacal Light Model Optimized for Optical Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light model, optimized for optical wavelengths, using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the SKYSURF program. The Kelsall et. al. 1998 model used infrared imaging from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic Background Explorer to create a 3D structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. However, this model cannot accurately represent zodiacal light emission outside of DIRBE's nominal wavelength bandpasses, the bluest of which is 1.25 micron. We present a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical forms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of wavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths (0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB) measurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions of zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than 80 deg. Fits to HST data show an uncertainty in the model of ~4.5%. Remarkably, the HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky - ZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr. The blue color of our diffuse light signal makes it unlikely to be of extragalactic origin. Instead, we suggest that a very dim spherical dust cloud may need to be included in the zodiacal light model, which we present here as a toy model.</description>

      <title>Non-linear evolution of the horizontal shear instability in stratified rotating fluids under the complete Coriolis acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the non-linear dynamics of horizontal shear instability in an incompressible, stratified and rotating fluid in the non-traditional $f$-plane, i.e. with the full Coriolis acceleration, using direct numerical simulations. The study is restricted to two-dimensional horizontal perturbations. It is therefore independent of the vertical (traditional) Coriolis parameter. However, the flow has three velocity components due to the horizontal (non-traditional) Coriolis parameter. Three different scenarios of non-linear evolution of the shear instability are identified, depending on the non-dimensional Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$ and the non-dimensional non-traditional Coriolis parameter $\tilde{f}$ (non-dimensionalized by the maximum shear), in the range $\tilde{f}&lt;N$ for fixed Reynolds and Schmidt numbers $Re=2000$, $Sc=1$. When the stratification is strong $N\gg 1$, the shear instability generates stable Kelvin-Helmholtz billows like in the traditional limit $\tilde{f}=0$. Furthermore, when $N\gg1$, the governing equations for any $\tilde{f}$ can be transformed into those for $\tilde{f}=0$. This enables us to directly predict the characteristics of the flow depending on $\tilde{f}$ and $N$. When $N$ is around unity and $\tilde{f}$ is above a threshold, the primary Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex is destabilised by secondary instabilities but it remains coherent. For weaker stratification, $N\leqslant0.5$ and $\tilde{f}$ large enough, secondary instabilities develop vigorously and destroy the primary vortex into small-scales turbulence. Concomitantly, the enstrophy rises to high values by stretching/tilting as in fully three-dimensional flows. A local analysis of the flow prior to the onset of secondary instabilities reveals that the Fjortoft necessary condition for instability is satisfied, suggesting that they correspond to shear instabilities.</description>

      <title>Designing trajectories in the Earth-Moon system: a Levenberg-Marquardt approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory design in cislunar space under a High-Fidelity Ephemeris Model (HFEM) is pursued through a nonlinear optimization perspective anchored on the transition of solutions from lower fidelity models, namely the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). The optimization problem is posed in the likeness of a multiple-shooting approach, aiming for segment-to-segment continuity while tracking proximity to the original CR3BP structures. The analysis of various formulations leads to the selection of an unconstrained least-squares problem for further investigation. The nonlinear optimization problem is convexified and the use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as an alternative to the minimum-norm update equation found in most literature, is investigated for its control over the update step and inherent robustness. Additional techniques such as adaptive weighting are employed to further consolidate the behavior of the proposed algorithm in challenging scenarios. Numerical trials evaluate the adequacy of the methodology presented and compare it to the minimum-norm baseline over various application cases, including the generation of quasi-periodic trajectories and orbital transfers between them. The proposed approach is found to outperform the baseline in applications where the initial guess is poor and the ease of including proximity constraints provides benefits in control over the shape of the converged solution.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there have been a growing number of observations indicating the presence of rocky material in short-period orbits around white dwarfs. In this Letter, we revisit the prospects for habitability around these post-main-sequence star systems. In addition to the typically considered radiative input luminosity, potentially habitable planets around white dwarfs are also subjected to significant tidal heating. The combination of these two heating sources can, for a narrow range of planetary properties and orbital parameters, continuously maintain surface temperatures amenable for habitability for planets around white dwarfs over time scales up to 10 Gyr. We show that for a specific locus of orbital parameter space, tidal heating can substantially extend the timescale of continuous habitability for a planet around a white dwarf.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Oceans on First-Generation Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here, we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star, and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet-planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the AGB phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost due to photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation from the newly-formed white dwarf, and then finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inwards to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.</description>

      <title>Orbital decay candidates reconsidered: WASP-4 b is not decaying and Kepler-1658 b is not a planet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay. Transit timing has revealed a few systems with apparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light travel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to an ~8-Jupiter-mass companion at ~8 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the "planet" to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently shows compelling evidence for orbital decay.</description>
