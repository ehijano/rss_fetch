      <title>CommGPT: A Graph and Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Communication Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess human-level cognitive and decision-making capabilities, making them a key technology for 6G. However, applying LLMs to the communication domain faces three major challenges: 1) Inadequate communication data; 2) Restricted input modalities; and 3) Difficulty in knowledge retrieval. To overcome these issues, we propose CommGPT, a multimodal foundation model designed specifically for communications. First, we create high-quality pretraining and fine-tuning datasets tailored in communication, enabling the LLM to engage in further pretraining and fine-tuning with communication concepts and knowledge. Then, we design a multimodal encoder to understand and process information from various input modalities. Next, we construct a Graph and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRG) framework, efficiently coupling Knowledge Graph (KG) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for multi-scale learning. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CommGPT through experimental validation.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic UAVs Cooperative Suppressive Jamming Method with Joint Task Assignment and Bandwidth Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low detectability and low cost of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) allow them to swarm near the radar network for effective jamming. The key to jamming is the reasonable task assignment and resource allocation of UAVs. However, the existing allocation model is somewhat ideal, weakly adaptive to the dynamic environment, and rarely considers frequency matching, which cannot suppress the frequency agile radar (FAR) network effectively. To solve these problems, a dynamic UAVs cooperative suppressive jamming method with joint task assignment and bandwidth allocation is proposed. To represent the matching relationship between UAVs and FARs, a system model of task assignment and bandwidth allocation is established, the problem is formulated as a dynamic mixed integer programming (D-MIP) problem. Then, a suppressive jamming evaluation indicator is proposed, and the utility function is designed based on the Quality of Service (QoS) framework to quantify the jamming effect of UAVs. To solve the combinational optimization problem, a two-step dynamic hybrid algorithm based on Kriging model is proposed, which can obtain the task assignment and bandwidth allocation schemes of UAVs by consuming fewer computational resources in dynamic environment. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective in terms of jamming performance, computational resource saving and dynamic environment adaptability.</description>

      <title>Handover-Aware Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Connected UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which aims to complete a mission of flying between two pre-determined locations while maintaining satisfactory communication quality with the ground base stations (GBSs). Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</description>

      <title>Robust Precoding for Rate-Splitting-Based Cell-Free MU-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems are an emerging technology that provides service simultaneously to multiple users but suffers from multiuser interference (MUI). In this work, we propose a robust transmit scheme based on rate-splitting (RS) for CF MU-MIMO systems in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and MUI. We also develop a robust linear precoder design for both private and common precoders based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, which incorporates in its design statistical information about the imperfect CSI to provide extra robustness to RS-CF MU-MIMO systems. A statistical analysis is carried out to derive closed-form sum-rate expressions along with a study of the computational complexity of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional robust and non-robust schemes.</description>

      <title>Identification Under the Semantic Effective Secrecy Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of identification over a discrete memoryless wiretap channel is examined under the criterion of semantic effective secrecy. This secrecy criterion guarantees both the requirement of semantic secrecy and of stealthy communication. Additionally, we introduce the related problem of combining approximation-of-output statistics and transmission. We derive a capacity theorem for approximation-of-output statistics transmission codes. For a general model, we present lower and upper bounds on the capacity, showing that these bounds are tight for more capable wiretap channels. We also provide illustrative examples for more capable wiretap channels, along with examples of wiretap channel classes where a gap exists between the lower and upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Wireless Users' Locations via Modulation Classification-based Passive Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broadcast nature of the wireless medium and openness of wireless standards, e.g., 3GPP releases 16-20, invite adversaries to launch various active and passive attacks on cellular and other wireless networks. This work identifies one such loose end of wireless standards and presents a novel passive attack method enabling an eavesdropper (Eve) to localize a line of sight wireless user (Bob) who is communicating with a base station or WiFi access point (Alice). The proposed attack involves two phases. In the first phase, Eve performs modulation classification by intercepting the downlink channel between Alice and Bob. This enables Eve to utilize the publicly available modulation and coding scheme (MCS) tables to do pesudo-ranging, i.e., the Eve determines the ring within which Bob is located, which drastically reduces the search space. In the second phase, Eve sniffs the uplink channel, and employs multiple strategies to further refine Bob's location within the ring. Towards the end, we present our thoughts on how this attack can be extended to non-line-of-sight scenarios, and how this attack could act as a scaffolding to construct a malicious digital twin map.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Wireless sensor networks data synchronization using node MCU memory for precision agriculture applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks have risen as a highly promising technology suitable for precision agriculture implementations, enabling efficient monitoring and control of agricultural processes. In precision agriculture, accurate and synchronized data collection is crucial for effective analysis and decision making. Using principles of information theory, we can define conditions and parameters that influence the efficient transmission and processing of information. Existing technologies have limitations in maintaining consistent time references, handling node failures, and unreliable communication links, leading to inaccurate data readings. Reliable data storage is demanding now-a-days for storing data on local monitoring station as well as in online live server. Sometime internet is not working properly due to congestion and there is frequent packet loss. Current solutions often synchronize records based on database timestamps, leading to record duplication and waste storage. Both databases synchronize each other after internet restoration. By providing synchronization among nodes and data, accuracy and storage will be saved in IoT based WSNs for precision agriculture applications. A prototype Node-MCU internal memory is used as a resource for achieving data synchronization. This proposed work generates record ID from Node MCU EEPROM which helps in records synchronization if there is any packet loss at the local server or at the online server to maintain synchronization accuracy despite unreliable communication links. Experiment shows that for a particular duration Node MCU generated 2364 packets and packet loss at local server was 08 and at online server was 174 packets. Results shows that after synchronization 99.87% packets were synchronized. Using previous technique of timestamp, the redundancy was 70% which reduced to 0% using our proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Combinatorial Semi-bandits with Graph Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical and M\"obius Quantum Codes for Asymmetric Pauli Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the implementation of quantum information systems, one type of Pauli error, such as phase-flip errors, may occur more frequently than others, like bit-flip errors. For this reason, quantum error-correcting codes that handle asymmetric errors are critical to mitigating the impact of such impairments. To this aim, several asymmetric quantum codes have been proposed. These include variants of surface codes like the XZZX and ZZZY surface codes, tailored to preserve quantum information in the presence of error asymmetries. In this work, we propose two classes of Calderbank, Shor and Steane (CSS) topological codes, referred to as cylindrical and M\"obius codes, particular cases of the fiber bundle family. Cylindrical codes maintain a fully planar structure, while M\"obius codes are quasi-planar, with minimal non-local qubit interactions. We construct these codes employing the algebraic chain complexes formalism, providing theoretical upper bounds for the logical error rate. Our results demonstrate that cylindrical and M\"obius codes outperform standard surface codes when using the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Galois Self-Dual GRS and TGRS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $q=p^m$ be a prime power and $e$ be an integer with $0\leq e\leq m-1$. $e$-Galois self-dual codes are generalizations of Euclidean $(e=0)$ and Hermitian ($e=\frac{m}{2}$ with even $m$) self-dual codes. In this paper, for a linear code $\C$ and a nonzero vector $\bm{u}\in \F_q^n$, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for the dual extended code $\underline{\C}[\bm{u}]$ of $\C$ to be $e$-Galois self-orthogonal. From this, a new systematic approach is proposed to prove the existence of $e$-Galois self-dual codes. By this method, we prove that $e$-Galois self-dual (extended) generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes of length $n&gt;\min\{p^e+1,p^{m-e}+1\}$ do not exist, where $1\leq e\leq m-1$. Moreover, based on the non-GRS properties of twisted GRS (TGRS) codes, we show that in many cases $e$-Galois self-dual (extended) TGRS codes do not exist. Furthermore, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for $(\ast)$-TGRS codes to be Hermitian self-dual, and then construct several new classes of Hermitian self-dual $(+)$-TGRS and $(\ast)$-TGRS codes.</description>

Abstract: The 6G Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MMIMO) networks can follow the so-called User-Centric Cell-Free (UCCF) architecture, where a single user is served by multiple Access Points (APs) coordinated by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). In this paper, we propose how O-RAN functionalities, i.e., rApp-xApp pair, can be used for energy-efficient Serving Cluster Formulation (SCF). Simulation studies show up to 37\% gain in Energy Efficiency (EE) of the proposed solution over the state-of-the-art Network-Centric (NC) designs.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network based Active and Passive Beamforming for Distributed STAR-RIS-Assisted Multi-User MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint active and passive beamforming design for distributed simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-user (MU)- mutiple input single output (MISO) systems, where the energy splitting (ES) mode is considered for the STAR-RIS. We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Association and Feedback Bit Allocation for FDD Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to user-centric association and feedback bit allocation for the downlink of a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system, operating under limited feedback constraints. In CF-mMIMO systems employing frequency division duplexing, each access point (AP) relies on channel information provided by its associated user equipments (UEs) for beamforming design. Since the uplink control channel is typically shared among UEs, we take account of each AP's total feedback budget, which is distributed among its associated UEs. By employing the Saleh-Valenzuela multi-resolvable path channel model with different average path gains, we first identify necessary feedback information for each UE, along with an appropriate codebook structure. This structure facilitates adaptive quantization of multiple paths based on their dominance. We then formulate a joint optimization problem addressing user-centric UE-AP association and feedback bit allocation. To address this challenge, we analyze the impact of feedback bit allocation and derive our proposed scheme from the solution of an alternative optimization problem aimed at devising long-term policies, explicitly considering the effects of feedback bit allocation. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme effectively enhances the performance of conventional approaches in CF-mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Channel Aging and Electromagnetic Interference on RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are two potential sixth-generation (6G) technologies. However, channel aging due to user mobility and electromagnetic interference (EMI) impinging on RISs can negatively affect performance. Existing research on RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems often overlooks these issues. This work focuses on the impact and mitigation of channel aging and EMI on RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems over spatially correlated channels. To mitigate the degradation caused by these issues, we introduce a novel two-phase channel estimation scheme with large-scale fading coefficient-aided pilot assignment to enhance channel estimation accuracy compared to conventional minimum mean square error estimators. We then develop closed-form expressions for the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) performance and using these, optimize the sum downlink SE with respect to the RIS coefficient matrices. This optimization is accomplished by the projected gradient ascent (GA) algorithm. The results show that our proposed two-phase channel estimation scheme can achieve a nearly 10%-likely SE improvement compared to conventional channel estimation in environments affected by channel aging. A further 10%~15%-likely SE improvement is achieved using the proposed GA algorithm compared to random RIS phases, especially when the number of RISs increases.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization for Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication</title>

Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antenna, the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation/boresight of each antenna by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Blind and Topological Interference Managements for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide significant enhancements in performance and resource efficiency compared to individual sensing and communication systems, primarily attributed to the collaborative use of wireless resources, radio waveforms, and hardware platforms. This paper focuses on the bistatic ISAC systems with dispersed multi-receivers and one sensor. Compared to a monostatic ISAC system, the main challenge in the bistatic setting is that the information messages are unknown to the sensor and therefore they are seen as interference, while the channel between the transmitters and the sensor is unknown to the transmitters. In order to mitigate the interference at the sensor while maximizing the communication degree of freedom, we introduce two strategies, namely, blind interference alignment and topological interference management. Although well-known in the context of Gaussian interference channels, these strategies are novel in the context of bistttic ISAC. For the bistatic ISAC models with heterogeneous coherence times or with heterogeneous connectivity, the achieved ISAC tradeoff points in terms of communication and sensing degrees of freedom are characterized. In particular, we show that the new tradeoff outperforms the time-sharing between the sensing-only and the communication-only schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly improve the channel estimation error for the sensing task compared to treating interference as noise at the sensor.</description>

Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) and movable antenna (MA) have recently emerged as promising technologies to exploit new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), which have attracted growing attention in wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna independently by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain as compared to the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multi-path channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is further proposed to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>From Bit to Block: Decoding on Erasure Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for bounding the block error threshold of a linear code $C\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^N$ over the erasure channel in terms of its bit error threshold. Our approach relies on understanding the minimum support weight of any $r$-dimensional subcode of $C$, for all small values of $r$. As a proof of concept, we use our machinery to obtain a new proof of the celebrated result that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity on the erasure channel with respect to block error probability.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Analysis of Receiver Quantization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate performance limits and design of communication in the presence of uniform output quantization with moderate to high resolution. Under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian codebook and nearest neighbor decoding rule, an achievable rate is derived in an analytical form by the generalized mutual information (GMI). The gain control before quantization is shown to be increasingly important as the resolution decreases, due to the fact that the loading factor (normalized one-sided quantization range) has increasing impact on performance. The impact of imperfect gain control in the high-resolution regime is characterized by two asymptotic results: 1) the rate loss due to overload distortion decays exponentially as the loading factor increases, and 2) the rate loss due to granular distortion decays quadratically as the step size vanishes. For a $2K$-level uniform quantizer, we prove that the optimal loading factor that maximizes the achievable rate scales like $2\sqrt{\ln (2K)}$ as the resolution increases. An asymptotically tight estimate of the optimal loading factor is further given, which is also highly accurate for finite resolutions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fake Agents on Information Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.05518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In online markets, agents often learn from other's actions in addition to their private information. Such observational learning can lead to herding or information cascades in which agents eventually ignore their private information and "follow the crowd". Models for such cascades have been well studied for Bayes-rational agents that arrive sequentially and choose pay-off optimal actions. This paper additionally considers the presence of fake agents that take a fixed action in order to influence subsequent rational agents towards their preferred action. We characterize how the fraction of such fake agents impacts the behavior of rational agents given a fixed quality of private information. Our model results in a Markov chain with a countably infinite state space, for which we give an iterative method to compute an agent's chances of herding and its welfare (expected pay-off). Our main result shows a counter-intuitive phenomenon: there exist infinitely many scenarios where an increase in the fraction of fake agents in fact reduces the chances of their preferred outcome. Moreover, this increase causes a significant improvement in the welfare of every rational agent. Hence, this increase is not only counter-productive for the fake agents but is also beneficial to the rational agents.</description>

      <title>SPLITZ: Certifiable Robustness via Split Lipschitz Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certifiable robustness gives the guarantee that small perturbations around an input to a classifier will not change the prediction. There are two approaches to provide certifiable robustness to adversarial examples: a) explicitly training classifiers with small Lipschitz constants, and b) Randomized smoothing, which adds random noise to the input to create a smooth classifier. We propose SPLITZ, a practical and novel approach which leverages the synergistic benefits of both the above ideas into a single framework. Our main idea is to split a classifier into two halves, constrain the Lipschitz constant of the first half, and smooth the second half via randomization. Motivation for SPLITZ comes from the observation that many standard deep networks exhibit heterogeneity in Lipschitz constants across layers. SPLITZ can exploit this heterogeneity while inheriting the scalability of randomized smoothing. We present a principled approach to train SPLITZ and provide theoretical analysis to derive certified robustness guarantees during inference. We present a comprehensive comparison of robustness-accuracy trade-offs and show that SPLITZ consistently improves on existing state-of-the-art approaches in the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For instance, with $\ell_2$ norm perturbation budget of $\epsilon=1$, SPLITZ achieves $43.2\%$ top-1 test accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset compared to state-of-art top-1 test accuracy $39.8\%$.</description>

      <title>Optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using techniques proposed in [Sason, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 59, 7118 (2013)] and [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)], and based on the results from the latter, we construct a globally optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy. This bound applies to any state under energy constraints imposed by arbitrary Hamiltonians that satisfy the Gibbs hypothesis. This completely solves the problem of finding an optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in this setting, previously known only for pairs of states that are sufficiently close to each other. Our main technical result, a globally optimal semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under general energy constraints, leads to this continuity bound. To prove it, we also derive an optimal Fano-type inequality for random variables with a countably infinite alphabet and a general constraint, as well as optimal semicontinuity and continuity bounds for the Shannon entropy in the same setting. In doing so, we improve the results derived in [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)].</description>
