      <title>Implications for the non-Gaussianity of primordial gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic signal by recent pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, including NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, CPTA and MPTA, has opened a new window to explore gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies. Motivated by the possibility that such a signal could arise from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), we investigate the implications of tensor non-Gaussianity for the PGW power spectrum. Utilizing PTA data sets, we provide constraints on local-type tensor non-Gaussianity parameter ${F}_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We find $|{F}_{\mathrm{NL}}|\lesssim 7.97$ for a log-normal PGW power spectrum. Our analysis reveals that even moderate tensor non-Gaussianity can lead to significant deviations from standard predictions, thereby offering a novel means to test inflationary scenarios and probe the underlying dynamics of the early Universe. Future multi-band GW observatories, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, will be instrumental in complementing these efforts and further refining our understanding of tensor non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Primordial Power Spectrum of Five Dimensional Uniform Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five dimensional (5D) uniform inflation describes a de Sitter (or approximate) solution of 5D Einstein equations, with cosmological constant and a 5D Planck scale $M_* \sim 10^9$ GeV. During the inflationary period all dimensions (compact and non-compact) expand exponentially in terms of the 5D proper time. This set-up requires about 40 $e$-folds to expand the fifth dimension from the fundamental length to the micron size. At the end of 5D inflation (or at any given moment during the inflationary phase) one can interpret the solution in terms of 4D fields using 4D Planck units from the relation $M_p^2 = 2 \pi R M_*^3$, which amounts going to the 4D Einstein frame. This implies that if the compactification radius $R$ expands $N$ $e$-folds, then the 3D space would expand $3N/2$ $e$-folds as a result of a uniform 5D inflation. We reexamine the primordial power spectrum predicted by this model and show that it is consistent with Planck's measurements of the comic microwave background. The best-fit to Planck data corresponds to $R \sim 10~\mu$m. A departure of the angular power spectrum predicted by 4D cosmology is visible at multipole moment $\ell \sim 7$.</description>

      <title>Effect of Peak Absolute Magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae and Sound Horizon Values on Hubble Tension using DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply data-motivated priors on the peak absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae ($M$), and on the sound horizon at the drag epoch ($r_d$), to study their impact on the Hubble tension, when compared to the Planck estimated value of the Hubble constant. We use the data from Pantheon$+$, cosmic chronometers, and the latest DESI BAO results for this purpose. We reaffirm the fact that there is a degeneracy between $M$ and $r_d$, and modifying the $r_d$ values to reconcile the Hubble tension also requires a change in the peak absolute magnitude $M$. For certain $M$ and $r_d$ priors, the tension is found to reduce to as low as (1.2-2) $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is believed to account for a significant portion of the mass in the universe, exerting a critical influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. This research delves into the processes of annihilation and decay of dark matter particles, which generate observable signals that deepen our comprehension of their characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, the study explores the potential role of primordial black holes, with a focus on the emissions of Hawking radiation that could offer valuable insights into their distribution and size range. A key aspect of this investigation revolves around the 21 cm signal, a vital tool for scrutinizing the effects of dark matter particles and primordial black hole phenomena on the intergalactic medium. The upcoming Hongmeng mission, featuring a lunar orbital interferometer array, is poised to revolutionize our ability to observe the 21 cm signal. By conducting measurements devoid of atmospheric disturbances, the mission will significantly boost sensitivity to subtle signals associated with dark matter particle annihilation, decay, and primordial black hole emissions. This study assesses the expected performance of the Hongmeng mission in detecting these telltale signs and aims to unveil fresh insights into the nature and interactions of dark matter particles and primordial black hole emissions through a meticulous analysis of the global 21 cm spectrum. The mission holds immense promise for reshaping our understanding of the universe's concealed components.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Post-Collision of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. The SP system can also determine the evolution of FDM solitons, such as head-on collision. In this paper, we first propose a new adimensional unit of length, time and mass. And then, we simulate the adimensional SP system with $\mathtt{PyUltraLight}$ to study the GWs from post-collision of FDM solitons when the linearized theory is valid and the GW back reaction on the evolution of FDM solitons is ignored. Finally, we find that the GWs from post-collisions have a frequency of (few ten-years)$^{-1}$ or (few years)$^{-1}$ when FDM mass is $m=10^{-18}\rm{eV}/c^2$ or $m=10^{-17}\rm{eV}/c^2$. Therefore, future detection of such GWs will constrain the property of FDM particle and solitons.</description>

      <title>Nonminimally coupled Dark Matter in Clusters of Galaxies: a fully comprehensive analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can affect the behavior of dark matter in galaxy clusters. We have considered the case of a disformal coupling, which leads to a modification of the Poisson equation. Building on an earlier work, we expand the analysis considering all possible disformal coupling scenarios and employing various dark matter density profiles. In doing so, we aim to constrain the key parameter in our model, the characteristic coupling length. To achieve this, we analyze data from a combination of strong and weak lensing using three statistical approaches: a single cluster fitting procedure, a joint analysis, and one with stacked profiles. Our findings show that the coupling length is typically very small, thus being fully consistent with general relativity, although with an upper limit at $1\sigma$ which is of the order of $100$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation from the Upward Step Model: Avoiding Overproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an upward step inflationary model, where nonlinearities between curvature perturbations and field fluctuations introduce a cutoff, deviating from the Gaussian case. This necessitates a reevaluation of PBH formation, as $\mathcal{R}$ is not the optimal variable for estimating abundance. Using the extended Press-Schechter formalism, we show that non-Gaussianity modifies both the curvature perturbation profile $\mathcal{R}(r)$ and the integration path in probability space, significantly impacting PBH abundance. Our results reveal that the abundance initially increases with the parameter $h$, which characterizes the relaxation stage after the step. However, beyond a critical value ($h \simeq 5.9$), it sharply declines before rising again. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianity introduces uncertainties in indirect PBH observations via gravitational waves. Notably, we present an example where a positive $f_{\rm NL}$ does not necessarily enhance PBH production, contrary to conventional expectations. Finally, by accounting for non-perturbative effects, we resolve the overproduction of PBHs suggested by pulsar timing array (PTA) data, underscoring the critical importance of incorporating non-Gaussianity in future studies.</description>

      <title>MPI-Rockstar: a Hybrid MPI and OpenMP Parallel Implementation of the Rockstar Halo finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder based on the Rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder code, which is one of the most extensively used halo finding codes. Compared to the original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP, which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory environments of modern supercomputers. This implementation can easily handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than 100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset for the next generation of cosmological surveys. As new functions to the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Whispers from Dark Stars Seeding Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First stars powered by dark matter (DM) heating instead of fusion can appear in the early Universe from theories of new physics. These dark stars (DSs) can be significantly larger and cooler than early Population III stars, and could seed supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We show that neutrino emission from supermassive DSs provides a novel window into probing SMBH progenitors. We estimate first DS constraints using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming neutrino telescopes offer distinct opportunities to further explore DS properties.</description>

      <title>LHC-friendly freeze-in dark matter via Higgs portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves footprints in dark matter direct detection and collider experiments. This situation can be altered in two-field context. In this work we propose a two-field freeze-in dark matter model through Higgs portal. The observed dark matter relic abundance is obtained by a decay of scalar mediator thermalized in the early Universe. While there is a lack of direct dark matter signals, the scalar mediator is in the reach of HL-LHC either through vector boson fusion or Mono-Z channel. Within allowed scalar mass window of 10-50 GeV, we use improved cuts to derive both $2\sigma$ exclusion and $5\sigma$ discovery limits, depending on the value of Higgs portal coupling. If verified, this scalar mediator signal allows us to infer the freeze-in dark matter.</description>

      <title>Variable gravitational potential of Milky Way analogues in HESTIA suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigations of trajectories of various objects orbiting the Milky Way (MW) halo with modern precision, achievable in observations by GAIA, requires sophisticated, non-stationary models of the Galactic potential. In this paper we analyze the evolution of the spherical harmonics expansion of MW analogues potential in constrained simulations of the Local Group (LG) from the HESTIA suite. We find that at distances $r&gt;50$~kpc the anisotropic part of the potential demonstrates a significant impact of the environment: ignoring the mass distribution outside the virial radius of the MW results in 20\% errors in the potential quadrupole at these distances. Spherical harmonics vary significantly during the last 6 Gyr. We attribute variations of the potential at $r\ge 30$~kpc to the motions of MW satellites and LG galaxies. We also predict that the anisotropy of the real MW potential should grow with distance in the range $r_\mathrm{vir}&lt;r&lt;500$~kpc, since all realizations of simulated MW-like objects demonstrate such a trend.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of composite solitons produced by scalar fields without thermal phase transitions in the early Universe is considered. We present numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of soliton structures at the post-inflationary stage. The realistic initial conditions are obtained through the simulation of multiple quantum fluctuations during the inflation epoch. The initial field distributions allow to form local soliton clusters in the early Universe without the need for the thermal production of a soliton network throughout the Universe. We find that in three-dimensional space, the nontrivial composite field structures are formed in the form of &lt;&lt;soliton foam&gt;&gt;, consisting of closed domain walls, domain walls bounded by cosmic strings, and scalar field radiation. The possible cosmological implications of the soliton foam are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>3+1 formalism of the minimally extended varying speed of light model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $3+1$ formalism provides a structured approach to analyzing spacetime by separating it into spatial and temporal components. When applied to the Robertson-Walker metric, it simplifies the analysis of cosmological evolution by dividing the Einstein field equations into constraint and evolution equations. It introduces the lapse function $N$ and the shift vector $N^i$, which control how time and spatial coordinates evolve between hypersurfaces. In standard model cosmology, $N = 1$ and $N^i = 0$ for the Robertson-Walker metric. However, the $N$ becomes a function of time when we apply the metric to the minimally extended varying speed of light model. This approach allows for a more direct examination of the evolution of spatial geometry and offers flexibility in handling scenarios where the lapse function and shift vector vary. In this manuscript, we derive the model's $N$ and $N^i$, along with the constraint and evolution equations, and demonstrate their consistency with the existing Einstein equations. We have shown in a previous paper that the possibility of changes in the speed of light in the Robertson-Walker metric is due to cosmological time dilation. Through the $3+1$ formalism, we can make the physical significance more explicit and demonstrate that it can be interpreted as the lapse function. From this, we show that the minimally extended varying speed of light model is consistent.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and argue that such transfer may remain inefficient at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Domain walls in Nelson-Barr axion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a concrete realization of a Nelson-Barr model addressing the strong CP problem with suppressed unfavorable corrections. This model has a scalar field that spontaneously breaks discrete symmetry, and its phase component can naturally be relatively light, which we call the Nelson-Barr axion. It has both a tree-level potential and the QCD instanton-induced potential like the QCD axion, each minimizing at the CP-conserving point. While one potential leads to domain wall formation, the other works as a potential bias. This model provides a natural setup for the collapse of the axion domain walls by a potential bias without spoiling a solution to the strong CP problem. We discuss the cosmological implications of domain wall collapses, including dark matter production and gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>HBT interferometry and Quantum Detection of Primordial Gravitational Waves in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity (to be precise, its projectable version) is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. Notably, one of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It has been suggested that, for some inflationary models, the non-classicality of primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed coherent quantum state can be detected using the Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) interferometry. We show that in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves can be generated during both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras of the Universe. Moreover, the frequency range of their quantum signatures is shown to extend beyond that of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation in order to recover standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling $\alpha$ that is typically very small and functions like $\hbar$ in a WKB expansion. We seek solutions of the form $\Psi = e^{iS/\alpha} \psi$ that are the closest quantum analog of a given classical background spacetime. The function $S$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, while $\psi$ obeys a Schr\"odinger-like equation and has a clear probabilistic interpretation. By using the semiclassical limit we express the relation between $\psi$ and the wavefunction of the universe in perturbation theory, $\psi_P$. We apply our formalism to two main examples. The first is a scalar field with a purely exponential potential, of which particularly simple, scaling solutions are known. The other is a slow-roll scenario expanded in the vicinity of the origin in field space. We discuss possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the higher ``time" derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation but not in the perturbative approach. We clarify the conditional probability content of the wavefunctions and how this is related with the standard gauge fixing procedure in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Scaling Topological Defects and Gravitational Waves in Higgs Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model is the Higgs portal extension involving a dark Higgs. Dark sectors that include dark matter candidates, WIMPs, axions, and dark photons, can naturally have this type of interaction, where the dark Higgs is charged under some symmetry, which may or may not be spontaneous broken by the vacuum expectation value. In this paper, using lattice simulations, I show that if the reheating temperature of the Universe is sufficiently high, topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings associated with these symmetries are naturally formed even if the symmetries are never restored due to negative thermal mass squareds. This occurs due to the early Universe's non-adiabatic oscillation of the Higgs around the onset of oscillation, which overshoots the origin, and tachyonic instability that enhances fluctuations. The gravitational waves generated by these topological defects may be very significant due to the energetic processes induced by matter effects in the hot and dense Universe irrelevant to the typical energy scale of the dark sector in the vacuum or whether the symmetry is broken in the vacuum. Alongside earlier studies such as usual phase transition, melting domain walls and melting cosmic strings scenarios that assume a symmetric phase in the early Universe, the Higgs portal models naturally predict local overdensities from topological defects, which may induce miniclusters and primordial black holes, as well as the gravitational waves.These phenomena provide novel opportunities to search for such scenarios. I also perform various numerical simulations for the relevant topic including melting domain walls and cosmic strings with inflationary and Gaussian fluctuations, for comparison--which have not been performed previously.</description>

      <title>SVR Algorithm as a Tool for More Optimal Intergalactic Medium Simulation in the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All kinds of simulations of the intergalactic medium, such as hydrodynamic simulation, N-body simulation, numerical and semi-numerical simulation, etc., have been used to realize the history of this medium. In addition, emulators also have become widely used in recent years. Especially because they are very fast, they are used in many works instead of actual complete simulations. Emulators are trained with the help of simulator results and can work with very high accuracy similar to real simulators. Usually, reliable machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, are used to program these emulators. In this work, we show that one of the best machine learning algorithms that can be used in general and have extremely high accuracy is the Support Vector Regression algorithm. This algorithm works better than the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm not only from the practical point of view but also from the theoretical point of view. To prove this issue, we have considered the 21SSD hydrodynamical simulation in addition to the theoretical arguments, and we have used both algorithms to be trained by this simulation for comparison. Finally, we have shown that the Support Vector Regression algorithm can be a much better and more accurate algorithm than neural network algorithms in future emulations, and by mastering it, one can neglect other algorithms with full confidence. Although this work is focused only on an intergalactic medium simulation in the Epoch of Reionization, it can be used for all other simulations regardless of their type. In other words, it can be employed for all hydrodynamic simulations, N-body simulations, etc. in all cosmic epochs and rely on its results.</description>

      <title>A dark energy parameterization independent constraint of the spatial curvature $\Omega_K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature $\Omega_K$ of the Universe has long been crucial in cosmology. In practice, this effort is often entangled with assumptions of dark energy. A combination of distance ($D_{\rm M}$, $D_{\rm L}$) and expansion rate ($H(z)$) measurements can break this degeneracy. However, fitting against discrete data points requires parameterizations of distance and expansion rate as functions of redshifts, which often induces cosmological model dependence. In this work, we propose a new dark energy model-independent parameterization of the cosmological comoving radial distance $\chi$. Fitting data combining distance ($D_{\rm M}$, $D_{\rm L}$) and Hubble parameter (or equivalently $D_H$) measurements, we are then able to obtain $\Omega_K$ in a dark energy model-independent manner. We test this parameterization and the associated fitting scheme with mock data generated with a wide range of fiducial dark energy equations of state ($-1.3&lt;w&lt;1.3$), finding that the best-fit $\Omega_K$ is always unbiased. Then we combine SDSS Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), and Observational Hubble Data (OHD) to constrain $\Omega_K$. We find a flat universe with $\Omega_K=-0.01\pm 0.09$. Most constraining power is contributed by SDSS BAO, with the BAO-alone constraint $\Omega_K=-0.03 \pm 0.10$. When replacing SDSS BAO with DESI year-one BAO measurement, we obtain $\Omega_K=0.06 \pm 0.08$. With the full DESI BAO data alone, we forecast $\sigma(\Omega_K)\sim 0.03$. Our result verifies the flatness of the universe free of dark energy modeling, and the proposed parameterization would be useful for future investigation of $\Omega_K$ and other parameters of interest, such as the horizon radius.</description>

      <title>Study of primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with the cross-correlations between the scalar-induced gravitational waves and the cosmic microwave background</title>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Impact of reionization history on constraining primordial gravitational waves in future all-sky cosmic microwave background experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the reionization history on examining the shape of the power spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. The large-scale CMB generated from the reionization epoch is important in probing the PGWs from all-sky experiments, such as LiteBIRD. The reionization model has been constrained by several astrophysical observations. However, its uncertainty could impact constraining models of the PGWs if we use large-scale CMB polarization. Here, by expanding the analysis of Mortonson &amp; Hu (2007), we estimate how reionization uncertainty impacts constraints on a generic primordial tensor power spectrum. We assume that CMB polarization is measured by a LiteBIRD-like experiment and the tanh model is adopted for a theoretical template when we fit data. We show that constraints are almost unchanged even if the true reionization history is described by an exponential model, where all parameters are within 68% Confidence Level (CL). We also show an example of the reionization history that the constraints on the PGWs are biased more than 68% CL. Even in that case, using E-mode power spectrum on large scales would exclude such a scenario and make the PGW constraints robust against the reionization uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Probing self-interacting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos with the cosmic 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the constraints on secret self-interactions of neutrinos by examining the impact of radiative scattering of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos. These neutrinos are produced from the decay of superheavy dark matter and interact with the cosmic neutrino background. We explore how these interactions influence the 21-cm hydrogen signal during the cosmic dark ages and cosmic dawn, periods relatively free from astrophysical uncertainties, providing a clearer signal for studying nonstandard neutrino interactions. By analyzing the global brightness temperature measurements, we constrain the scattering cross section of ultrahigh-energy self-interacting neutrinos, determining the coupling constant $g$ to be within $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}$ for neutrino energies in the PeV to EeV range. Interestingly, these constraints are more competitive than those from existing astrophysical and collider experiments. As future 21-cm experiments focus on measuring brightness temperature across a wide range of redshifts from the cosmic dark ages to reionization, using the epoch of 21-cm to probe neutrino properties could provide crucial insights into dark matter and neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within some theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14280v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters (GCs) can be determined by calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of GCs within Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG), and modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction. We apply the formulations on the masses of 10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs. Within a regime, we get an insight that all formulations could match the Newtonian mass. Thus, the impact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected in this regime. The noteworthy impact starts if we set $\kappa=5\times10^{40}$ m$^2$ for EiBI theory, $\Upsilon=-0.1655\times10^{69}$ for BHG, and $\beta_0=-1.656\times10^{110}$ for MENG. We also compare our results from EiBI theory and BHG with the baryonic masses $M_{bar}$ of the GCs. A better linear fit is achieved by EiBI theory with $\kappa=5.80\times10^{40}$ m$^2$, which gives the slope $\mathcal{M}$ of $0.126\pm0.086$. This value is closer to unity than the one of BHG. This leads us to the fact that EiBI theory is more effective than BHG in alleviating the mass discrepancy between hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass in GCs. Nevertheless, neither EiBI theory nor BHG completely addresses the mass discrepancy problem.</description>

      <title>Search for ultralight dark matter in the SuperMAG high-fidelity dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter, such as kinetically mixed dark-photon dark matter (DPDM) or axionlike-particle dark matter (axion DM), can source an oscillating magnetic-field signal at Earth's surface. Previous work searched for this signal in a publicly available dataset of global magnetometer measurements maintained by the SuperMAG collaboration. This ``low-fidelity" dataset reported measurements with a 1-minute time resolution, allowing the search to set leading direct constraints on DPDM and axion DM with Compton frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\leq1/(1\,\mathrm{min})$ [corresponding to masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\leq7\times10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV}$]. More recently, a dedicated experiment undertaken by the SNIPE Hunt collaboration has also searched for this same signal at higher frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\geq0.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $m_\mathrm{DM}\geq2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). In this work, we search for this signal of ultralight DM in the SuperMAG ``high-fidelity" dataset, which features a 1-second time resolution, allowing us to probe the gap in parameter space between the low-fidelity dataset and the SNIPE Hunt experiment. The high-fidelity dataset exhibits lower geomagnetic noise than the low-fidelity dataset and features more data than the SNIPE Hunt experiment, making it a powerful probe of ultralight DM. Our search finds no robust DPDM or axion DM candidates. We set constraints on DPDM and axion DM parameter space for $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz}\leq f_\mathrm{DM}\leq0.98\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $4\times10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}\leq m_\mathrm{DM}\leq4\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). Our results are the leading direct constraints on both DPDM and axion DM in this mass range, and our DPDM constraint surpasses the leading astrophysical constraint in a narrow range around $m_{A'}\approx2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin for the compaction function for primordial black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole (PBH) formation at least during radiation domination. In the long-wavelength limit, we identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric and this explains why it cannot be greater than $1/2$. The maximum value of $1/2$ corresponds to an extremal surface, which is simultaneously a bifurcating trapping horizon and admits a circular photon orbit in the static spacetime. In the long-wavelength regime of the physical expanding universe, we discover that the Shibata-Sasaki compaction reaches its maximum value of $1/2$ at maximal and minimal surfaces on the constant-time spacelike hypersurface, which feature a type II perturbation and both correspond to photon spheres expanding along with the cosmological expansion. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction measures how close to the type II configuration the positively curved region is.</description>

      <title>The initial mass function of stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important functions in astrophysics because it is key to reconstructing the cosmological matter cycle, understanding the formation of super-massive black holes, and deciphering the light from high-redshift observations. The IMF's dependency on the physical conditions of the gas and its connection to the galaxy-wide IMF connects the molecular clumps to the cosmological scale. The extraction of the IMF from observational data requires a thorough understanding of stellar evolution, the time-dependent stellar multiplicity, the stellar-dynamical evolution of dense stellar populations, and the structures, star formation histories, and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies. The IMF in galaxies, referred to as the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF), and the IMF in individual star-forming regions (the stellar IMF) need not be the same, although the former must be related to the latter. Observational surveys inform on whether star-forming regions provide evidence for the stellar IMF being a probability density distribution function. They may also indicate star formation to optimally follow an IMF shaped by the physical conditions of the star-forming gas. Both theoretical and observational evidence suggest a relationship between the initial mass function of brown dwarfs and that of stars. Late-type stars may arise from feedback-regulated fragmentation of molecular cloud filaments, which build up embedded clusters. In contrast, early-type stars form under more violent accretion and feedback-regulated conditions near the centers of these clusters. The integration over all star-forming molecular cloud clumps and their stellar IMFs in a galaxy via the IGIMF theory yields its gwIMF which sensitively depends on the physical properties of the molecular cloud clumps and the range of their masses that depends on the SFR of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifts induced by light scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Feebly-Interacting Peccei-Quinn Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion is widely studied as a dark matter (DM) candidate and as a solution to the strong CP problem of the Standard Model. In conventional field-theoretic models, a much larger mass scale than the electroweak (EW) scale is typically introduced to spontaneously break Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry with a large enough axion decay constant, $f_a$, thereby avoiding constraints from star cooling. In this paper, I propose an alternative approach to achieving the large decay constant: a PQ scalar field with a large wave function renormalization constant, analogous to a feebly coupled gauge theory. Other dimensionless parameters are ${O}(1)$ in the unit of the EW scale for the naturalness. This framework predicts a light PQ Higgs boson with a mass $\sim (\mathrm{EW~scale})^2 / f_a$. Exotic particles associated with the PQ anomaly are expected to have masses around the EW scale. The proposed model alleviates both the PQ quality and EW scale fine-tuning problems and introduces interesting axion-PQ Higgs cosmologies, encompassing: slim axion DM from a fat string network, heavy axion DM from PQ Higgs condensate fragmentation, PQ Higgs DM, and axion-PQ Higgs co-DM scenarios. Potential experimental signatures are explored, including fifth-force tests, DM detections, accelerator searches, and gravitational wave observations by employing lattice simulation. Possible extensions of the scenario are also discussed.</description>
