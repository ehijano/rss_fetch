      <title>Lithium Borohydride (LiBH4): An Innovative Material for Neutron Radiation Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation shielding plays a crucial role in various industries, including nuclear and space exploration. Among the most abundant elements and isotopes found in nature, 10B has one of the highest neutron absorption cross-sections, closely followed by 6Li. It is worth noting that hydrogen, with its light nucleus, serves as an excellent neutron reflector. Surprisingly, the potential of the lithium borohydride molecule (LiBH4), which consists exclusively of these elements, as a shield against neutron radiation has not yet been explored. This study investigates various materials that can potentially be used as shields. First, we assessed traditional shields and previous optimizations for shielding. The findings showed that concrete containing 10% B4C yielded the best results. High-performance concrete (HPC) replaced regular concrete. By gradually incorporating lithium borohydride into the shield, along with the appropriate level of boron carbide, further optimization was achieved. Calculations were performed using the MCNPX 2.7E code. The introduction of the new shield resulted in a significant 40% reduction in volume compared with the previous sample. The study findings showed that a 30 cm thick shield effectively blocked 95% of the total neutrons and 92% of the total gamma radiation. Additionally, it was noted that the shielding effects of lithium borohydride against fast neutrons are greater than those of boron carbide. Various parameters and data of the designed shield were calculated and compared with those of the previous sample.</description>

      <title>Strong-field effects in the photo-induced dissociation of the hydrogen molecule on a silver nanoshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic catalysis is a rapidly growing field of research, both from experimental and computational perspectives. Experimental observations demonstrate an enhanced dissociation rate for molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles under low-intensity visible light. The hot-carrier transfer from the nanoparticle to the molecule is often claimed as the mechanism for dissociation. However, the charge transfer time scale is on the order of few femtoseconds and cannot be resolved experimentally. In this situation, ab initio non-adiabatic calculations can provide a solution. Such simulations, however, have their own limitations related to the computational cost. To accelerate plasmonic catalysis simulations, many researchers resort to applying high-intensity external fields to nanoparticle-molecule systems. Here, we show why such an approach can be problematic and emphasize the importance of considering strong-field effects when interpreting the results of time-dependent density functional theory simulations of plasmonic catalysis. By studying the hydrogen molecule dissociation on the surface of a silver nanoshell and analyzing the electron transfer at different field frequencies and intensities, we demonstrate that the molecule dissociates due to multiphoton absorption and subsequent ionization.</description>
