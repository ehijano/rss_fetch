      <title>Euler's elastica in nonlocal theory of elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the Euler's elastic problem, i.e., finding a stationary configuration (planar elastica) of the Bernoulli's thin ideal elastic rod with boundary conditions defined through fixed endpoints and/or tangents at the endpoints, for the chosen nonlocal differential constitutive stress-strain relation (i.e., nonlocal theory of elasticity) is considered. In the classical (local) Euler-Bernoulli's beam model, the general solutions of the governing equations (that are inhomogeneous but linear) for bending moments and shear forces in the case of large deformations can be obtained using the Jacobi elliptic functions and incomplete elliptic integrals. For the discussed nonlocal toy differential model, the general solutions of the governing equations (that are this time nonlinear) can also be expressed in the parametric form through the linear combinations of all three incomplete elliptic integrals. As further research, we plan to apply some boundary conditions (clamped, simply supported, etc.) for the obtained nonlocal general solutions in order to compare them to the local solutions for the corresponding boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>The Thermal Unbalance Effect Induced by a Journal Bearing in Rigid and Flexible Rotors: Experimental Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work presents the experimental analyses of a rigid (short) and a flexible (long) rotor subject to thermal unbalance effects. The rotors are supported by a ball bearing and by a cylindrical journal bearing. The differential heating generated in the journal bearing is responsible for the thermal unbalance. The results obtained with the short rotor at 7 krpm showed an increase in the synchronous amplitudes but slight phase changes before stabilization. The pronounced hysteresis of the synchronous amplitudes obtained during coast-down proved that the amplitude increase is due to the thermal unbalance. The results obtained for the long rotor at 6.6 krpm showed the same stabilized response when start-up was performed in 180___s. However, an instability leading to journal bearing contact was triggered when the start-up time was decreased to 80___s. The presented experimental results are the synchronous amplitudes and phases, the mean temperatures, and the maximum temperature differences of the journal and of the bearing and the phase lags between the high spot and the hot spot.</description>

      <title>On the Invariance of the Spacetime Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric proof of the invariance of the relativistic spacetime interval based solely on the constancy of the speed of light, and the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime. The derivation is based on a simple construction involving light rectangles, whose areas remain invariant across inertial frames. Based on this construction, we also derive the Lorentz transformations.</description>

      <title>Which Rope Breaks? A Study of Tension Distribution in Multi-Rope Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tension distribution in systems of mass-less ropes under different loading conditions. For a two-rope system, we demonstrate how the breaking scenario depends on the applied force dynamics: rapid pulling causes the lower rope to break, while gradual pulling leads to upper rope failure. Extending to a three-rope Y-shaped configuration, we identify a critical angle $\theta_{C}=60^{\circ}$ that determines which rope breaks first. When the angle between the upper ropes exceeds this critical value, the upper ropes fail before the lower one. We further analyze how an attached mass at the junction point modifies this critical angle and establish maximum mass limits for valid solutions. Our results provide practical insights for introductory physics students understanding static forces and system stabilities.</description>
