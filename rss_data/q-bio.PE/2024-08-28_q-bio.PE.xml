      <title>A framework for the modelling and the analysis of epidemiological spread in commuting populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, our goal is to establish a framework for the mathematical modelling and the analysis of the spread of an epidemic in a large population commuting regularly, typically along a time-periodic pattern, as is roughly speaking the case in populous urban center. We consider a large number of distinct homogeneous groups of individuals of various sizes, called subpopulations, and focus on the modelling of the changing conditions of their mixing along time and of the induced disease transmission. We propose a general class of models in which the 'force of infection' plays a central role, which attempts to 'reconcile' the classical modelling approaches in mathematical epidemiology, based on compartmental models, with some widely used analysis results (including those by P. van den Driessche and J. Watmough in 2002), established for apparently less structured systems of nonlinear ordinary-differential equations. We take special care in explaining the modelling approach in details, and provide analysis results that allow to compute or estimate the value of the basic reproduction number for such general periodic epidemic systems.</description>

      <title>A review of sequential Monte Carlo methods for real-time disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo methods are a powerful framework for approximating the posterior distribution of a state variable in a sequential manner. They provide an attractive way of analyzing dynamic systems in real-time, taking into account the limitations of traditional approaches such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which are not well suited to data that arrives incrementally. This paper reviews and explores the application of Sequential Monte Carlo in dynamic disease modeling, highlighting its capacity for online inference and real-time adaptation to evolving disease dynamics. The integration of kernel density approximation techniques within the stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartment model is examined, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in monitoring time-varying parameters such as the effective reproduction number. Case studies, including simulations with synthetic data and analysis of real-world COVID-19 data from Ireland, demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach for informing timely public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Connecting Mass-action Models and Network Models for Infectious Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infectious disease modeling is used to forecast epidemics and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Although the core assumption of mass-action models of homogeneously mixed population is often implausible, they are nevertheless routinely used in studying epidemics and provide useful insights. Network models can account for the heterogeneous mixing of populations, which is especially important for studying sexually transmitted diseases. Despite the abundance of research on mass-action and network models, the relationship between them is not well understood. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap by first identifying a spreading rule that results in an exact match between disease spreading on a fully connected network and the classic mass-action models. We then propose a method for mapping epidemic spread on arbitrary networks to a form similar to that of mass-action models. We also provide a theoretical justification for the procedure. Finally, we show the advantages of the proposed methods using synthetic data that is based on an empirical network. These findings help us understand when mass-action models and network models are expected to provide similar results and identify reasons when they do not.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of adapting pathogens and host immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As pathogens spread in a population of hosts, immunity is built up and the pool of susceptible individuals is depleted. This generates selective pressure, to which many human RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, respond with rapid antigenic evolution and frequent emergence of immune evasive variants. However, the host's immune systems adapt and older immune responses wane, such that escape variants only enjoy a growth advantage for a limited time. If variant growth dynamics and reshaping of host-immunity operate on comparable time scales, viral adaptation is determined by eco-evolutionary interactions that are not captured by models of rapid evolution in a fixed environment. Here, we use a Susceptible/Infected model to describe the interaction between an evolving viral population in a dynamic but immunologically diverse host population. We show that depending on strain cross-immunity, heterogeneity of the host population, and durability of immune responses, escape variants initially grow exponentially, but lose their growth advantage before reaching high frequencies. Their subsequent dynamics follows an anomalous random walk determined by future escape variants and results in variant trajectories that are unpredictable. This model can explain the apparent contradiction between the clearly adaptive nature of antigenic evolution and the quasi-neutral dynamics of high frequency variants observed for influenza viruses.</description>
