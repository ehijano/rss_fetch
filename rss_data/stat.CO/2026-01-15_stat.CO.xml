      <title>Bayesian Semi-Blind Deconvolution at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind image deconvolution refers to the problem of simultaneously estimating the blur kernel and the true image from a set of observations when both the blur kernel and the true image are unknown. Sometimes, additional image and/or blur information is available and the term semi-blind deconvolution (SBD) is used. We consider a recently introduced Bayesian conjugate hierarchical model for SBD, formulated on an extended cyclic lattice to allow a computationally scalable Gibbs sampler. In this article, we extend this model to the general SBD problem, rewrite the previously proposed Gibbs sampler so that operations are performed in the Fourier domain whenever possible, and introduce a new marginal Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) blur update, obtained by analytically integrating the blur-image joint conditional over the image. The cyclic formulation combined with non-trivial linear algebra manipulations allows a Fourier-based, scalable HMC update, otherwise complicated by the rigid constraints of the SBD problem. Having determined the padding size in the cyclic embedding through a numerical experiment, we compare the mixing and exploration behaviour of the Gibbs and HMC blur updates on simulated data and on a real geophysical seismic imaging problem where we invert a grid with $300\times50$ nodes, corresponding to a posterior with approximately $80,000$ parameters.</description>

      <title>Global polynomial-time estimation in statistical nonlinear inverse problems via generalized stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-linear statistical inverse problems pose major challenges both for statistical analysis and computation. Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \nabla\!\cdot(f\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schr\"odinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation.</description>

      <title>Tail-Sensitive KL and R\'enyi Convergence of Unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via One-Shot Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms are among the most widely used sampling methods in high dimensional settings, yet their convergence properties are poorly understood in divergences that quantify relative density mismatch, such as Kullback-Leibler (KL) and R\'enyi divergences. These divergences naturally govern acceptance probabilities and warm-start requirements for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains. In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and R\'enyi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to R\'enyi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing. As a consequence, our results provide quantitative control of relative density mismatch, clarify the role of discretization bias in strong divergences, and yield principled guarantees relevant both for unadjusted sampling and for generating warm starts for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Sparse covariate-driven factorization of high-dimensional brain connectivity with application to site effect correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neuroimaging studies often collect data from multiple scanners across different sites, where variations in scanners, scanning procedures, and other conditions across sites can introduce artificial site effects. These effects may bias brain connectivity measures, such as functional connectivity (FC), which quantify functional network organization derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). How to leverage high-dimensional network structures to effectively mitigate site effects has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we propose SLACC (Sparse LAtent Covariate-driven Connectome) factorization, a multivariate method that explicitly parameterizes covariate effects in latent subject scores corresponding to sparse rank-1 latent patterns derived from brain connectivity. The proposed method identifies localized site-driven variability within and across brain networks, enabling targeted correction. We develop a penalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation, incorporating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to guide optimization. Extensive simulations validate SLACC's robustness in recovering the true parameters and underlying connectivity patterns. Applied to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, SLACC demonstrates its ability to reduce site effects. The R package to implement our method is publicly available.</description>

      <title>LARGE: A Locally Adaptive Regularization Approach for Estimating Gaussian Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graphical Lasso (GLASSO) is a widely used algorithm for learning high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter \lambda in this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global \lambda and do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.
  In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Importance Sampling for Estimating Occupation Time for SDE Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the complementary cumulative distribution function of the occupation time (i.e., the time spent below a threshold) for a process governed by a stochastic differential equation. The focus is on the right tail, where the underlying event becomes rare, and using variance reduction techniques is essential to obtain computationally efficient estimates. Building on recent developments that relate importance sampling (IS) to stochastic optimal control, this work develops an optimal single level IS (SLIS) estimator based on the solution of an auxiliary Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation (PDE). The cost of solving the HJB-PDE is incorporated into the total computational work, and an optimized trade off between preprocessing and sampling is proposed to minimize the overall cost. The SLIS approach is extended to the multilevel setting to enhance efficiency, yielding a multilevel IS (MLIS) estimator. A necessary and sufficient condition under which the MLIS method outperforms the SLIS method is established, and a common likelihood MLIS formulation is introduced that satisfies this condition under appropriate regularity assumptions. The classical multilevel Monte Carlo complexity theory can be extended to accommodate settings where the single-level variance varies with the discretization level. As a special case, the variance-decay behavior observed in the IS framework stems from the zero variance property of the optimal control. Notably, the total work complexity of MLIS can be better than an order of two. Numerical experiments in the context of fade duration estimation demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach and validate these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Decoder-only Clustering in Graphs with Dynamic Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript studies nodal clustering in graphs having a time series at each node. The proposed framework includes priors for low-dimensional representations and a decoder that bridges latent representations with time series. Addressing the limitation that the evolution of nodal attributes is often overlooked, temporal and structural patterns are fused into low-dimensional representations to facilitate clustering. Parameters are learned via maximum approximate likelihood, with a graph-fused LASSO regularization imposed on prior parameters. The optimization problem is solved via alternating direction method of multipliers; Langevin dynamics are employed for posterior inference. Simulation studies on block and grid graphs with autoregressive dynamics, and applications to California county temperatures and a word co-occurrence network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method.</description>
