      <title>Time-resolved dynamic CBCT reconstruction using prior-model-free spatiotemporal Gaussian representation (PMF-STGR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved CBCT imaging, which reconstructs a dynamic sequence of CBCTs reflecting intra-scan motion (one CBCT per x-ray projection without phase sorting or binning), is highly desired for regular and irregular motion characterization, patient setup, and motion-adapted radiotherapy. Representing patient anatomy and associated motion fields as 3D Gaussians, we developed a Gaussian representation-based framework (PMF-STGR) for fast and accurate dynamic CBCT reconstruction. PMF-STGR comprises three major components: a dense set of 3D Gaussians to reconstruct a reference-frame CBCT for the dynamic sequence; another 3D Gaussian set to capture three-level, coarse-to-fine motion-basis-components (MBCs) to model the intra-scan motion; and a CNN-based motion encoder to solve projection-specific temporal coefficients for the MBCs. Scaled by the temporal coefficients, the learned MBCs will combine into deformation vector fields to deform the reference CBCT into projection-specific, time-resolved CBCTs to capture the dynamic motion. Due to the strong representation power of 3D Gaussians, PMF-STGR can reconstruct dynamic CBCTs in a 'one-shot' training fashion from a standard 3D CBCT scan, without using any prior anatomical or motion model. We evaluated PMF-STGR using XCAT phantom simulations and real patient scans. Metrics including the image relative error, structural-similarity-index-measure, tumor center-of-mass-error, and landmark localization error were used to evaluate the accuracy of solved dynamic CBCTs and motion. PMF-STGR shows clear advantages over a state-of-the-art, INR-based approach, PMF-STINR. Compared with PMF-STINR, PMF-STGR reduces reconstruction time by 50% while reconstructing less blurred images with better motion accuracy. With improved efficiency and accuracy, PMF-STGR enhances the applicability of dynamic CBCT imaging for potential clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Material Decomposition Using Spectral Diffusion Posterior Sampling with a Compressed Polychromatic Forward Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously introduced Spectral Diffusion Posterior Sampling (Spectral DPS) as a framework for accurate one-step material decomposition by integrating analytic spectral system models with priors learned from large datasets. This work extends the 2D Spectral DPS algorithm to 3D by addressing potentially limiting large-memory requirements with a pre-trained 2D diffusion model for slice-by-slice processing and a compressed polychromatic forward model to ensure accurate physical modeling. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed memory-efficient 3D Spectral DPS enables material decomposition of clinically significant volume sizes. Quantitative analysis reveals that Spectral DPS outperforms other deep-learning algorithms, such as InceptNet and conditional DDPM in contrast quantification, inter-slice continuity, and resolution preservation. This study establishes a foundation for advancing one-step material decomposition in volumetric spectral CT.</description>

      <title>Automatic determination of the different control mechanisms in upright position by a wavelet method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent model to analyze the Center of Pressure trajectories is based on the fractional Brownian motion. By doing so, one note that standing still is describe by different mechanisms following the frequency. Previous studies exhibit the existence of a control mechanism which stabilize the upright position at a large enough time scales (from 0.3 s to 1.2 s depending on the method and on the authors) or equivalently at low frequencies. The different mechanisms are separated by a critical time scale or equivalently a critical frequency. This critical frequency is fundamental to understand the control mechanism of upright position : only physiological phenomenon at frequencies larger than this critical frequency could contribute to the task of maintaining equilibrium. A new statistical method is introduced based onto the recent progress in signal processing : the wavelets analysis. The algorithm is entirely automatic. Seventeen healthy young subjects were studied under quiet-standing conditions, the mean value of critical frequency is 1.8 Hz corresponding to a mean critical time scale 0.68 s. The algorithm is entirely automatic.</description>

      <title>Deducing Cardiorespiratory Motion of Cardiac Substructures Using a Novel 5D-MRI Workflow for Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22578v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Cardiotoxicity is a devastating complication of thoracic radiotherapy. Current radiotherapy imaging protocols are insufficient to decouple and quantify cardiac motion, limiting substructure-specific motion considerations in treatment planning. We propose a 5D-MRI workflow for substructure-specific motion analysis, with future extension to margin calculation.
  Approach: Our 5D-MRI workflow was implemented for 10 healthy volunteers, ranging from 23 to 65 years old, reconstructing images for end-exhale/inhale and active-exhale/inhale for end-systole/diastole. For motion assessment, proximal coronary arteries, chambers, great vessels, and cardiac valves/nodes were contoured across all images and verified. Centroid/bounding box excursion was calculated for cardiac, respiratory, and hysteresis motion. Distance metrics were tested for statistical independence across substructure pairings.
  Main Results: 5D-MRI images were successfully acquired and contoured for all volunteers. Cardiac motion was greatest for the coronary arteries (specifically the right coronary) and smallest for the great vessels. Respiratory motion was dominant in the S-I direction and largest for the inferior vena cava. Respiratory hysteresis was generally &lt;5 mm but exceeded 5 mm for some volunteers. For cardiac motion, there were statistical differences between the coronary arteries, chambers, and great vessels, and between the right/left heart. Respiratory motion differed significantly between the base and apex of the heart.
  Significance: Our 5D-MRI workflow successfully decouples cardiorespiratory motion with one ~5-minute acquisition. Cardiac motion was &gt;5mm for the coronary arteries and chambers, while respiratory motion was &gt;5mm for all substructures. Statistical considerations and inter-patient variability indicate a substructure and patient-specific approach may be needed for PRV assessment.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Novel Quantitative Multiparametric MR Sequence for Radiation Therapy Treatment Response Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate a Deep-Learning-enhanced MUlti-PArametric MR sequence (DL-MUPA) for treatment response assessment for brain metastases patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and head-and-neck (HnN) cancer patients undergoing conventionally fractionation adaptive radiation therapy. Methods: DL-MUPA derives quantitative T1 and T2 maps from a single 4-6-minute scan denoised via DL method using dictionary fitting. Phantom benchmarking was performed on a NIST-ISMRM phantom. Longitudinal patient data were acquired on a 1.5T MR-simulator, including pre-treatment (PreTx) and every 3 months after SRS (PostTx) in brain, and PreTx, mid-treatment and 3 months PostTx in HnN. Changes of mean T1 and T2 values were calculated within gross tumor volumes (GTVs), residual disease (RD, HnN), parotids, and submandibular glands (HnN) for treatment response assessment. Uninvolved normal tissues (normal appearing white matter in brain, masseter in HnN) were evaluated to as control. Results: Phantom benchmarking showed excellent inter-session repeatability (coefficient of variance &lt;1% for T1, &lt;7% for T2). Uninvolved normal tissue suggested acceptable in-vivo repeatability (brain |$\Delta$|&lt;5%, HnN |$\Delta$T1|&lt;7%, |$\Delta$T2|&lt;18% (4ms)). Remarkable changes were noted in resolved brain metastasis ($\Delta$T1=14%) and necrotic settings ($\Delta$T1=18-40%, $\Delta$T2=9-41%). In HnN, two primary tumors showed T2 increase (PostTx GTV $\Delta$T2&gt;13%, RD $\Delta$T2&gt;18%). A nodal disease resolved PostTx (GTV $\Delta$T1=-40%, $\Delta$T2=-33%, RD $\Delta$T1=-29%, $\Delta$T2=-35%). Enhancement was found in involved parotids (PostTx $\Delta$T1&gt;12%, $\Delta$T2&gt;13%) and submandibular glands (PostTx $\Delta$T1&gt;15%, $\Delta$T2&gt;35%) while the uninvolved organs remained stable. Conclusions: DL-MUPA shows promise for treatment response assessment and identifying potential endpoints for functional sparing.</description>

      <title>Impact of Oxygen on DNA Damage Distribution in 3D Genome and Its Correlation to Oxygen Enhancement Ratio under High LET Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variation of the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) across different values of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) currently lacks a comprehensive mechanistic interpretation and a mechanistic model. Our earlier research revealed a significant correlation between the distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome and radiation-induced cell death, which offers valuable insights into the oxygen effect. In this study, we formulate a model where the reaction of oxygen is represented as the probability of inducing DNA strand breaks. Then it is integrated into a track-structure Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the impact of oxygen on the spatial distribution of DSBs within the 3D genome. Results show that the incidence ratios of clustered DSBs in a single topologically associating domain (TAD) (case 2) and DSBs in frequently-interacting TADs (case 3) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions closely align with the trend of the OER of cell survival across various LET values. By utilizing the parameters derived from our previous study, we calculate the OER values related to cell survival. Our OER curves exhibit good correspondence with experimental data. This study provides a potentially mechanistic explanation for the changes in OER across different LET levels. High-LET irradiation leads to dense ionization events, resulting in an overabundance of lesions that readily induce case 2 and case 3. The probabilities of cell death associated with case 2 and case 3 are substantially higher than other damage patterns. This may contribute to the main mechanism governing the variation of OER for high LET. Our study further underscores the importance of the DSB distribution within the 3D genome in the context of radiation-induced cell death. This study also provides valuable reference points for establishing a mechanistic model of OER.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Cardiac Digital Twin from surface ECGs: Insights into Identifiability of Ventricular Conduction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital twins for cardiac electrophysiology are an enabling technology for precision cardiology. Current forward models are advanced enough to simulate the cardiac electric activity under different pathophysiological conditions and accurately replicate clinical signals like torso electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this work, we address the challenge of matching subject-specific QRS complexes using anatomically accurate, physiologically grounded cardiac digital twins. By fitting the initial conditions of a cardiac propagation model, our non-invasive method predicts activation patterns during sinus rhythm. For the first time, we demonstrate that distinct activation maps can generate identical surface ECGs. To address this non-uniqueness, we introduce a physiological prior based on the distribution of Purkinje-muscle junctions. Additionally, we develop a digital twin ensemble for probabilistic inference of cardiac activation. Our approach marks a significant advancement in the calibration of cardiac digital twins and enhances their credibility for clinical application.</description>
