      <title>Machine Learning Integrated Near-Infrared Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Accurate Strain-Level Virus Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain-level identification of viruses is critical for effective public health responses to potential outbreaks, yet current diagnostic methods often lack the necessary speed or sensitivity. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers great potential for fast and precise virus clarification through unique vibrational fingerprints of biological components. However, existing protocols typically operate outside of the tissue's transparent near-infrared (NIR) window, and are further limited by the intrinsic complexity of clinical viral samples, which complicates spectral analysis and recognition. Here, we report an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered NIR-SERS platform that integrates machine learning with a rationally designed hybrid substrate: gold nanostars (AuNSt) coupled with gold-coated carbon nanotube arrays (AuCNT). This architecture generates highly localized plasmonic hot spots resonant tuned to NIR excitation, as confirmed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), enabling effective signal amplification from viral components. Our system and protocols provide accurate classification of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses and coronaviruses, not only at the type and subtype levels, but also the more challenging strain level. This approach overcomes the plasmonic mismatch in conventional SERS and the lack of generalizability in AI-driven diagnostics. It shows promise for enhancing rapid virus detection and identification of novel strains and outbreak response capabilities, thus potentially addressing critical challenges in global public health preparedness.</description>

      <title>Density-Functional Tight Binding Meets Maxwell: Unraveling the Mysteries of (Strong) Light-Matter Coupling Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB) with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations (DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles, which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework, including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Vibrational frequencies and stark tuning rate with continuum electro-chemical models and grand canonical density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating electrochemical interfaces using density functional theory (DFT) requires incorporating the effects of electrochemical potential. The electrochemical potential acts as a new degree of freedom that can effectively tune DFT results as electrochemistry does. Typically, this is implemented by adjusting the number of electrons on the solid surface within the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation, under the framework of an implicit solvent model and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PB equation), thereby modulating the potential difference between the solid and liquid. These simulations are often referred to as grand-canonical or fixed-potential DFT calculations. To apply this additional degree of freedom, Legendre transforms are employed in the calculation of free energy, establishing the relationship between the grand potential and the free energy. Other key physical properties, such as atomic forces, vibrational frequencies, and Stark tuning rates, can be derived based on this relationship rather than directly using Legendre transforms. This paper begins by discussing the numerical methodologies for the continuum model of electrolyte double layers and grand-potential algorithms. We then show that atomic forces under grand-canonical ensemble match the Hellmann-Feynman forces observed in canonical ensemble, as previously established. However, vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit distinct behaviors between these conditions. Through finite displacement methods, we confirm that vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit differences between grand-canonical and canonical ensembles.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Role of Solvents in DBTTF:HATCN Ternary Cocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor (D:A) cocrystals offer a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications, but the impact of residual solvent molecules on their properties remains an open question. We investigate six novel D:A cocrystals of dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbo-nitrile (HATCN), prepared via solvent evaporation, yielding 1:1 molar ratios, and horizontal vapor deposition, resulting in solvent-free 3:2 cocrystals. Combining spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that, while the electronic and optical properties of the cocrystals are largely unaffected by solvent inclusion, the charge transfer mechanism is surprisingly complex. Raman spectroscopy reveals a consistent charge transfer of 0.11 $e$ across all considered structures, corroborated by DFT calculations on solvent-free systems. Partial charge analysis reveals that in solvated cocrystals, solvent molecules actively participate in the charge transfer process as primary electron acceptors. This involvement can perturb the expected D:A behavior, revealing a faceted charge-transfer mechanism in HATCN even beyond the established involvement of its cyano group. Overall, our study demonstrates that while solution-based methods preserve the intrinsic D:A characteristics, solvents can be leveraged as active electronic components, opening new avenues for material design.</description>

      <title>Competitive Adsorption of Toluene and Water in MFI-type Zeolites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competitive adsorption is a major challenge in understanding catalytic activity, selectivity and reaction mechanisms in confined environments such as zeolites. This study investigated competitive adsorption in MFI-type zeolites (ZSM-5) using solid-state NMR, focusing on the interplay between toluene and water. Quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy identified three distinct populations of adsorbed toluene evolving with increasing toluene loading. The adsorption behavior was consistent across a series of samples with Si/Al ratio ranging from 11.5 to 140. Combining 1D and 2D NMR techniques with sample engineering (e.g. pore-blocking) enabled the assignment of the populations to toluene within the zeolite channels, at the pore mouths, and adsorbed on the external crystal surface. Crucially, introducing water to toluene-loaded zeolites caused a partial displacement of toluene from the internal channels, but significant removal from the pore mouths. This dis-placement occurred even in the highly hydrophobic zeolite (Si/Al = 140), where water still preferentially adsorbed to Br{\o}nsted acid sites and silanol species. The results highlight the critical impact that competitive adsorption from solvents, products, or impurities can have on the efficiency and selectivity of zeolite-mediated transformations.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Time Fluctuation Theorem and Thermodynamic Bound in Cooperative Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine (e.g., a motor protein or an enzyme) in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer constant, resulting in a breakdown of this expression. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis (a type of continuous-time Markov process with relevance to $\beta$-galactosidase and human glucokinase), as we explore this fluctuation theorem in cooperative biomolecular networks. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain surprising and concise results from complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be established for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this dramatic reduction is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of cooperative networks. The validity of this expression can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a unique signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, as well as the general form, revealing a thermodynamic bound on the kinetic branching ratio (a measure of directionality defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics for cooperative biomolecular machines.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21593v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity upon dehydration, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics. Finally, the increase of the area per lipid in our tension-free simulations of the fluid membranes hints that the permittivity decrease upon dehydration is concomitant with an intermembrane attraction.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum magnetism and many-body physics is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics. %Magnetic exchange interactions in frustrated lattices give rise to rich phase diagrams. Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for exploring the exotic quantum phases arising from complex orderings in frustrated lattices. Here we demonstrate a showcase system based on altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks, which can be constructed from a C$_{40}$ molecular synthon with two effective spin-1/2 sites due to the resonance structures. The charge-neutral, pure-carbon systems exhibit an altermagnetic ground state with fully compensated spins arranged in alternating C$_{40}$ units in a 2D rutile-like lattice, leading to $d$-wave splitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnons. We report a rich phase diagram including altermagentic, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be accessed via moderate strains. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring quantum many-body physics based on scalable, chemically-feasible, molecular quantum materials.</description>
