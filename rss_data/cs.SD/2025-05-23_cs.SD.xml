      <title>A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Efficient Multichannel Acoustic Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a deep-learning framework for controlling multichannel acoustic feedback in audio devices. Traditional digital signal processing methods struggle with convergence when dealing with highly correlated noise such as feedback. We introduce a Convolutional Recurrent Network that efficiently combines spatial and temporal processing, significantly enhancing speech enhancement capabilities with lower computational demands. Our approach utilizes three training methods: In-a-Loop Training, Teacher Forcing, and a Hybrid strategy with a Multichannel Wiener Filter, optimizing performance in complex acoustic environments. This scalable framework offers a robust solution for real-world applications, making significant advances in Acoustic Feedback Control technology.</description>

      <title>Source Separation by Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of single-channel audio source separation with the goal of reconstructing $K$ sources from their mixture. We address this ill-posed problem with FLOSS (FLOw matching for Source Separation), a constrained generation method based on flow matching, ensuring strict mixture consistency. Flow matching is a general methodology that, when given samples from two probability distributions defined on the same space, learns an ordinary differential equation to output a sample from one of the distributions when provided with a sample from the other. In our context, we have access to samples from the joint distribution of $K$ sources and so the corresponding samples from the lower-dimensional distribution of their mixture. To apply flow matching, we augment these mixture samples with artificial noise components to ensure the resulting "augmented" distribution matches the dimensionality of the $K$ source distribution. Additionally, as any permutation of the sources yields the same mixture, we adopt an equivariant formulation of flow matching which relies on a suitable custom-designed neural network architecture. We demonstrate the performance of the method for the separation of overlapping speech.</description>

      <title>Selective Invocation for Multilingual ASR: A Cost-effective Approach Adapting to Speech Recognition Difficulty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have significantly advanced, enabling a single model to handle multiple languages, inherent linguistic differences and data imbalances challenge SOTA performance across all languages. While language identification (LID) models can route speech to the appropriate ASR model, they incur high costs from invoking SOTA commercial models and suffer from inaccuracies due to misclassification. To overcome these, we propose SIMA, a selective invocation for multilingual ASR that adapts to the difficulty level of the input speech. Built on a spoken large language model (SLLM), SIMA evaluates whether the input is simple enough for direct transcription or requires the invocation of a SOTA ASR model. Our approach reduces word error rates by 18.7% compared to the SLLM and halves invocation costs compared to LID-based methods. Tests on three datasets show that SIMA is a scalable, cost-effective solution for multilingual ASR applications.</description>

      <title>Discrete Tokens Exhibit Interlanguage Speech Intelligibility Benefit: an Analytical Study Towards Accent-robust ASR Only with Native Speech Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we gained insight that contributes to achieving accent-robust ASR using only native speech data. In human perception of non-native speech, the phenomenon known as "interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit" (ISIB) is observed, where non-native listeners who share the native language with the speaker understand the speech better compared even to native listeners. Based on the idea that discrete tokens extracted from self-supervised learning (SSL) models represent the human perception of speech, we conducted an analytical study on the robustness of discrete token-based ASR to non-native speech, varying the language used for training the tokenization, which is viewed as a technical implementation of ISIB. The results showed that ISIB actually occurred in the discrete token-based ASR. Since our approach relies only on native speech data to simulate the behavior of human perception, it is expected to be applicable to a wide range of accents for which speech data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Prosodically Enhanced Foreign Accent Simulation by Discrete Token-based Resynthesis Only with Native Speech Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a method for synthesizing foreign-accented speech only with native speech data using discrete tokens obtained from self-supervised learning (SSL) models was proposed. Considering limited availability of accented speech data, this method is expected to make it much easier to simulate foreign accents. By using the synthesized accented speech as listening materials for humans or training data for automatic speech recognition (ASR), both of them will acquire higher robustness against foreign accents. However, the previous method has a fatal flaw that it cannot reproduce duration-related accents. Durational accents are commonly seen when L2 speakers, whose native language has syllable-timed or mora-timed rhythm, speak stress-timed languages, such as English. In this paper, we integrate duration modification to the previous method to simulate foreign accents more accurately. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully replicates durational accents seen in real L2 speech.</description>

      <title>SpecMaskFoley: Steering Pretrained Spectral Masked Generative Transformer Toward Synchronized Video-to-audio Synthesis via ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

      <title>Differentiable K-means for Fully-optimized Discrete Token-based ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of discrete tokens derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) models for various speech-related tasks. These tokens serve not only as substitutes for text in language modeling but also as intermediate representations for tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, discrete tokens are typically obtained via k-means clustering of SSL features independently of downstream tasks, making them suboptimal for specific applications. This paper proposes the use of differentiable k-means, enabling the joint optimization of tokenization and downstream tasks. This approach enables the fine-tuning of the SSL parameters and learning weights for outputs from multiple SSL layers. Experiments were conducted with ASR as a downstream task. ASR accuracy successfully improved owing to the optimized tokens. The acquired tokens also exhibited greater purity of phonetic information, which were found to be useful even in speech resynthesis.</description>

      <title>AudioTrust: Benchmarking the Multifaceted Trustworthiness of Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs. Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.</description>

      <title>Dialogue in Resonance: An Interactive Music Piece for Piano and Real-Time Automatic Transcription System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents &lt;Dialogue in Resonance&gt;, an interactive music piece for a human pianist and a computer-controlled piano that integrates real-time automatic music transcription into a score-driven framework. Unlike previous approaches that primarily focus on improvisation-based interactions, our work establishes a balanced framework that combines composed structure with dynamic interaction. Through real-time automatic transcription as its core mechanism, the computer interprets and responds to the human performer's input in real time, creating a musical dialogue that balances compositional intent with live interaction while incorporating elements of unpredictability. In this paper, we present the development process from composition to premiere performance, including technical implementation, rehearsal process, and performance considerations.</description>

      <title>Layer-wise Investigation of Large-Scale Self-Supervised Music Representation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models for music information retrieval based on self-supervised learning (SSL) are becoming popular, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, there is limited research on the specific meanings of the encoded information and their applicability. Exploring these aspects can help us better understand their capabilities and limitations, leading to more effective use in downstream tasks.
  In this study, we analyze the advanced music representation model MusicFM and the newly emerged SSL model MuQ. We focus on three main aspects: (i) validating the advantages of SSL models across multiple downstream tasks, (ii) exploring the specialization of layer-wise information for different tasks, and (iii) comparing performance differences when selecting specific layers. Through this analysis, we reveal insights into the structure and potential applications of SSL models in music information retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduces X-ARES (eXtensive Audio Representation and Evaluation Suite), a novel open-source benchmark designed to systematically assess audio encoder performance across diverse domains. By encompassing tasks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music, X-ARES provides two evaluation approaches for evaluating audio representations: linear fine-tuning and unparameterized evaluation. The framework includes 22 distinct tasks that cover essential aspects of audio processing, from speech recognition and emotion detection to sound event classification and music genre identification. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio encoders reveals significant performance variations across different tasks and domains, highlighting the complexity of general audio representation learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice Conversion research in recent times has increasingly focused on improving the zero-shot capabilities of existing methods. Despite remarkable advancements, current architectures still tend to struggle in zero-shot cross-lingual settings. They are also often unable to generalize for speakers of unseen languages and accents. In this paper, we adopt a simple yet effective approach that combines discrete speech representations from self-supervised models with a non-autoregressive Diffusion-Transformer based conditional flow matching speech decoder. We show that this architecture allows us to train a voice-conversion model in a purely textless, self-supervised fashion. Our technique works without requiring multiple encoders to disentangle speech features. Our model also manages to excel in zero-shot cross-lingual settings even for unseen languages.</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>UBGAN: Enhancing Coded Speech with Blind and Guided Bandwidth Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practical application of speech codecs, a multitude of factors such as the quality of the radio connection, limiting hardware or required user experience necessitate trade-offs between achievable perceptual quality, engendered bitrate and computational complexity. Most conventional and neural speech codecs operate on wideband (WB) speech signals to achieve this compromise. To further enhance the perceptual quality of coded speech, bandwidth extension (BWE) of the transmitted speech is an attractive and popular technique in conventional speech coding. In contrast, neural speech codecs are typically trained end-to-end to a specific set of requirements and are often not easily adaptable. In particular, they are typically trained to operate at a single fixed sampling rate. With the Universal Bandwidth Extension Generative Adversarial Network (UBGAN), we propose a modular and lightweight GAN-based solution that increases the operational flexibility of a wide range of conventional and neural codecs. Our model operates in the subband domain and extends the bandwidth of WB signals from 8 kHz to 16 kHz, resulting in super-wideband (SWB) signals. We further introduce two variants, guided-UBGAN and blind-UBGAN, where the guided version transmits quantized learned representation as a side information at a very low bitrate additional to the bitrate of the codec, while blind-BWE operates without such side-information. Our subjective assessments demonstrate the advantage of UBGAN applied to WB codecs and highlight the generalization capacity of our proposed method across multiple codecs and bitrates.</description>

      <title>Attractor-Based Speech Separation of Multiple Utterances by Unknown Number of Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of single-channel speech separation, where the number of speakers is unknown, and each speaker may speak multiple utterances. We propose a speech separation model that simultaneously performs separation, dynamically estimates the number of speakers, and detects individual speaker activities by integrating an attractor module. The proposed system outperforms existing methods by introducing an attractor-based architecture that effectively combines local and global temporal modeling for multi-utterance scenarios. To evaluate the method in reverberant and noisy conditions, a multi-speaker multi-utterance dataset was synthesized by combining Librispeech speech signals with WHAM! noise signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed system accurately estimates the number of sources. The system effectively detects source activities and separates the corresponding utterances into correct outputs in both known and unknown source count scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Temporal Flexibility: Neural Speech Codec with Variable Frame Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However, speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC) technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>From Tens of Hours to Tens of Thousands: Scaling Back-Translation for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR systems.</description>

      <title>Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>

      <title>Neurodyne: Neural Pitch Manipulation with Representation Learning and Cycle-Consistency GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pitch manipulation is the process of producers adjusting the pitch of an audio segment to a specific key and intonation, which is essential in music production. Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.</description>

      <title>ShiftySpeech: A Large-Scale Synthetic Speech Dataset with Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of synthetic speech detection has enjoyed considerable attention, with recent methods achieving low error rates across several established benchmarks. However, to what extent can low error rates on academic benchmarks translate to more realistic conditions? In practice, while the training set is fixed at one point in time, test-time conditions may exhibit distribution shifts relative to the training conditions, such as changes in speaker characteristics, emotional expressiveness, language and acoustic conditions, and the emergence of novel synthesis methods. Although some existing datasets target subsets of these distribution shifts, systematic analysis remains difficult due to inconsistencies between source data and synthesis systems across datasets. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the rapid development of new text-to-speech (TTS) and vocoder systems, which continually expand the diversity of synthetic speech. To enable systematic benchmarking of model performance under distribution shifts, we introduce ShiftySpeech, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 3,000 hours of synthetic speech across 7 source domains, 6 TTS systems, 12 vocoders, and 3 languages. ShiftySpeech is specifically designed to evaluate model generalization under controlled distribution shifts while ensuring broad coverage of modern synthetic speech generation techniques. It fills a key gap in current benchmarks by supporting fine-grained, controlled analysis of generalization robustness. All tested distribution shifts significantly degrade detection performance of state-of-the-art detection approaches based on self-supervised features. Overall, our findings suggest that reliance on synthetic speech detection methods in production environments should be carefully evaluated based on anticipated distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Slamming: Training a Speech Language Model on One GPU in a Day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Slam, a recipe for training high-quality Speech Language Models (SLMs) on a single academic GPU in 24 hours. We do so through empirical analysis of model initialisation and architecture, synthetic training data, preference optimisation with synthetic data and tweaking all other components. We empirically demonstrate that this training recipe also scales well with more compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute cost. We hope these insights will make SLM training and research more accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, our results far outperform predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM feasibility.

      <title>TASTE: Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding for Spoken Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts target spoken language models (SLMs) that not only listen but also speak for more natural human-LLM interaction. Joint speech-text modeling is a promising direction to achieve this. However, the effectiveness of recent speech tokens for joint modeling remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a method that can achieve this through a attention-based aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. With TASTE, we perform straightforward joint spoken language modeling by using Low-Rank Adaptation on the pre-trained text LLM. Experimental results show that TASTE-based SLMs perform comparable to previous work on SALMON and StoryCloze; while significantly outperform other pre-trained SLMs on speech continuation across subjective and objective evaluations. To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling. Our demo, code, and model are available at https://mtkresearch.github.io/TASTE-SpokenLM.github.io.</description>

      <title>Improving Noise Robustness of LLM-based Zero-shot TTS via Discrete Acoustic Token Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods tend to preserve the acoustic environment of the audio prompt, leading to degradation in synthesized speech quality when the audio prompt contains noise. In this paper, we propose a novel neural codec-based speech denoiser and integrate it with the advanced LLM-based TTS model, LauraTTS, to achieve noise-robust zero-shot TTS. The proposed codec denoiser consists of an audio codec, a token denoiser, and an embedding refiner. The token denoiser predicts the first two groups of clean acoustic tokens from the noisy ones, which can serve as the acoustic prompt for LauraTTS to synthesize high-quality personalized speech or be converted to clean speech waveforms through the embedding refiner and codec decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed codec denoiser outperforms state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) methods, and the proposed noise-robust LauraTTS surpasses the approach using additional SE models.</description>
