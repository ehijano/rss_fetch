      <title>MM-MovieDubber: Towards Multi-Modal Learning for Multi-Modal Movie Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current movie dubbing technology can produce the desired speech using a reference voice and input video, maintaining perfect synchronization with the visuals while effectively conveying the intended emotions. However, crucial aspects of movie dubbing, including adaptation to various dubbing styles, effective handling of dialogue, narration, and monologues, as well as consideration of subtle details such as speaker age and gender, remain insufficiently explored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal generative framework. First, it utilizes a multi-modal large vision-language model (VLM) to analyze visual inputs, enabling the recognition of dubbing types and fine-grained attributes. Second, it produces high-quality dubbing using large speech generation models, guided by multi-modal inputs. Additionally, a movie dubbing dataset with annotations for dubbing types and subtle details is constructed to enhance movie understanding and improve dubbing quality for the proposed multi-modal framework. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In details, the LSE-D, SPK-SIM, EMO-SIM, and MCD exhibit improvements of up to 1.09%, 8.80%, 19.08%, and 18.74%, respectively.</description>

      <title>CP-LLM: Context and Pixel Aware Large Language Model for Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging research topic with broad applications. Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions and a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the perceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based VQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual understanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small distortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware Large Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring dual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at both high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity, along with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between these aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust quality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced sensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is trained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description generation, and pairwise comparisons. Experiment results demonstrate that CP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on established VQA benchmarks and superior robustness to pixel distortions, confirming its efficacy for comprehensive and practical video quality assessment in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Signals of Provenance: Practices &amp; Challenges of Navigating Indicators in AI-Generated Media for Sighted and Blind Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-Generated (AIG) content has become increasingly widespread by recent advances in generative models and the easy-to-use tools that have significantly lowered the technical barriers for producing highly realistic audio, images, and videos through simple natural language prompts. In response, platforms are adopting provable provenance with platforms recommending AIG to be self-disclosed and signaled to users. However, these indicators may be often missed, especially when they rely solely on visual cues and make them ineffective to users with different sensory abilities. To address the gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=28) with 15 sighted and 13 BLV participants to examine their interaction with AIG content through self-disclosed AI indicators. Our findings reveal diverse mental models and practices, highlighting different strengths and weaknesses of content-based (e.g., title, description) and menu-aided (e.g., AI labels) indicators. While sighted participants leveraged visual and audio cues, BLV participants primarily relied on audio and existing assistive tools, limiting their ability to identify AIG. Across both groups, they frequently overlooked menu-aided indicators deployed by platforms and rather interacted with content-based indicators such as title and comments. We uncovered usability challenges stemming from inconsistent indicator placement, unclear metadata, and cognitive overload. These issues were especially critical for BLV individuals due to the insufficient accessibility of interface elements. We provide practical recommendations and design implications for future AIG indicators across several dimensions.</description>

      <title>DualComp: End-to-End Learning of a Unified Dual-Modality Lossless Compressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most learning-based lossless compressors are designed for a single modality, requiring separate models for multi-modal data and lacking flexibility. However, different modalities vary significantly in format and statistical properties, making it ineffective to use compressors that lack modality-specific adaptations. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) offer a potential solution for modality-unified compression, their excessive complexity hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we focus on the two most common modalities, image and text, and propose DualComp, the first unified and lightweight learning-based dual-modality lossless compressor. Built on a lightweight backbone, DualComp incorporates three key structural enhancements to handle modality heterogeneity: modality-unified tokenization, modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing mixture-of-experts. A reparameterization training strategy is also used to boost compression performance. DualComp integrates both modality-specific and shared parameters for efficient parameter utilization, enabling near real-time inference (200KB/s) on desktop CPUs. With much fewer parameters, DualComp achieves compression performance on par with the SOTA LLM-based methods for both text and image datasets. Its simplified single-modality variant surpasses the previous best image compressor on the Kodak dataset by about 9% using just 1.2% of the model size.</description>

      <title>Joint Flow And Feature Refinement Using Attention For Video Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in video restoration have focused on recovering high-quality video frames from low-quality inputs. Compared with static images, the performance of video restoration significantly depends on efficient exploitation of temporal correlations among successive video frames. The numerous techniques make use of temporal information via flow-based strategies or recurrent architectures. However, these methods often encounter difficulties in preserving temporal consistency as they utilize degraded input video frames. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel video restoration framework named Joint Flow and Feature Refinement using Attention (JFFRA). The proposed JFFRA is based on key philosophy of iteratively enhancing data through the synergistic collaboration of flow (alignment) and restoration. By leveraging previously enhanced features to refine flow and vice versa, JFFRA enables efficient feature enhancement using temporal information. This interplay between flow and restoration is executed at multiple scales, reducing the dependence on precise flow estimation. Moreover, we incorporate an occlusion-aware temporal loss function to enhance the network's capability in eliminating flickering artifacts. Comprehensive experiments validate the versatility of JFFRA across various restoration tasks such as denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method demonstrates a remarkable performance improvement of up to 1.62 dB compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>What Media Frames Reveal About Stance: A Dataset and Study about Memes in Climate Change Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47 subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities, and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs' limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change internet memes.</description>

      <title>CoNav: Collaborative Cross-Modal Reasoning for Embodied Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied navigation demands comprehensive scene understanding and precise spatial reasoning. While image-text models excel at interpreting pixel-level color and lighting cues, 3D-text models capture volumetric structure and spatial relationships. However, unified fusion approaches that jointly fuse 2D images, 3D point clouds, and textual instructions face challenges in limited availability of triple-modality data and difficulty resolving conflicting beliefs among modalities. In this work, we introduce CoNav, a collaborative cross-modal reasoning framework where a pretrained 3D-text model explicitly guides an image-text navigation agent by providing structured spatial-semantic knowledge to resolve ambiguities during navigation. Specifically, we introduce Cross-Modal Belief Alignment, which operationalizes this cross-modal guidance by simply sharing textual hypotheses from the 3D-text model to the navigation agent. Through lightweight fine-tuning on a small 2D-3D-text corpus, the navigation agent learns to integrate visual cues with spatial-semantic knowledge derived from the 3D-text model, enabling effective reasoning in embodied navigation. CoNav achieves significant improvements on four standard embodied navigation benchmarks (R2R, CVDN, REVERIE, SOON) and two spatial reasoning benchmarks (ScanQA, SQA3D). Moreover, under close navigation Success Rate, CoNav often generates shorter paths compared to other methods (as measured by SPL), showcasing the potential and challenges of fusing data from different modalities in embodied navigation.

      <title>Representation Discrepancy Bridging Method for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR) plays a critical role in geographic information interpretation, disaster monitoring, and urban planning by establishing semantic associations between image and textual descriptions. Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) models typically adopt symmetric adapter structures for exploring cross-modal correlations. However, the strong discriminative nature of text modality may dominate the optimization process and inhibits image representation learning. The nonnegligible imbalanced cross-modal optimization remains a bottleneck to enhancing the model performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a Representation Discrepancy Bridging (RDB) method for the RSITR task. On the one hand, a Cross-Modal Asymmetric Adapter (CMAA) is designed to enable modality-specific optimization and improve feature alignment. The CMAA comprises a Visual Enhancement Adapter (VEA) and a Text Semantic Adapter (TSA). VEA mines fine-grained image features by Differential Attention (DA) mechanism, while TSA identifies key textual semantics through Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism. On the other hand, this study extends the traditional single-task retrieval framework to a dual-task optimization framework and develops a Dual-Task Consistency Loss (DTCL). The DTCL improves cross-modal alignment robustness through an adaptive weighted combination of cross-modal, classification, and exponential moving average consistency constraints. Experiments on RSICD and RSITMD datasets show that the proposed RDB method achieves a 6%-11% improvement in mR metrics compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods and a 1.15%-2% improvement over the full fine-tuned GeoRSCLIP model.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Tversky-Aware Domain Incremental Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for multimodal MRI segmentation with missing modalities typically assume that all MRI modalities are available during training. However, in clinical practice, some modalities may be missing due to the sequential nature of MRI acquisition, leading to performance degradation. Furthermore, retraining models to accommodate newly available modalities can be inefficient and may cause overfitting, potentially compromising previously learned knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Replay-based Hypergraph Domain Incremental Learning (ReHyDIL) for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. ReHyDIL leverages Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) to enable the segmentation model to learn from newly acquired MRI modalities without forgetting previously learned information. To enhance segmentation performance across diverse patient scenarios, we introduce the Cross-Patient Hypergraph Segmentation Network (CHSNet), which utilizes hypergraphs to capture high-order associations between patients. Additionally, we incorporate Tversky-Aware Contrastive (TAC) loss to effectively mitigate information imbalance both across and within different modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2019 dataset demonstrate that ReHyDIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of over 2\% in the Dice Similarity Coefficient across various tumor regions. Our code is available at ReHyDIL.</description>

      <title>Creatively Upscaling Images with Global-Regional Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary diffusion models show remarkable capability in text-to-image generation, while still being limited to restricted resolutions (e.g., 1,024 X 1,024). Recent advances enable tuning-free higher-resolution image generation by recycling pre-trained diffusion models and extending them via regional denoising or dilated sampling/convolutions. However, these models struggle to simultaneously preserve global semantic structure and produce creative regional details in higher-resolution images. To address this, we present C-Upscale, a new recipe of tuning-free image upscaling that pivots on global-regional priors derived from given global prompt and estimated regional prompts via Multimodal LLM. Technically, the low-frequency component of low-resolution image is recognized as global structure prior to encourage global semantic consistency in high-resolution generation. Next, we perform regional attention control to screen cross-attention between global prompt and each region during regional denoising, leading to regional attention prior that alleviates object repetition issue. The estimated regional prompts containing rich descriptive details further act as regional semantic prior to fuel the creativity of regional detail generation. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our C-Upscale manages to generate ultra-high-resolution images (e.g., 4,096 X 4,096 and 8,192 X 8,192) with higher visual fidelity and more creative regional details.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Visual Correspondence into Diffusion Model for Virtual Try-On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown preliminary success in virtual try-on (VTON) task. The typical dual-branch architecture comprises two UNets for implicit garment deformation and synthesized image generation respectively, and has emerged as the recipe for VTON task. Nevertheless, the problem remains challenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we novelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior to tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet as the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained appearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and match the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person through local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware cues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way of putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point matching to supervise diffusion model training. A point-focused diffusion loss is further devised to fully take the advantage of semantic point matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong garment detail preservation of our approach, evidenced by state-of-the-art VTON performances on both VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.

      <title>Pursuing Temporal-Consistent Video Virtual Try-On via Dynamic Pose Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic images from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify multiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this, we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial relationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in image generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning capabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we make our code and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/gogoduan/GoT-R1.</description>

      <title>Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>

      <title>Copy-Move Forgery Detection and Question Answering for Remote Sensing Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by practical demands in land resource monitoring and national defense security, this paper introduces the Remote Sensing Copy-Move Question Answering (RSCMQA) task. Unlike traditional Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA), RSCMQA focuses on interpreting complex tampering scenarios and inferring relationships between objects. We present a suite of global RSCMQA datasets, comprising images from 29 different regions across 14 countries. Specifically, we propose five distinct datasets, including the basic dataset RS-CMQA, the category-balanced dataset RS-CMQA-B, the high-authenticity dataset Real-RSCM, the extended dataset RS-TQA, and the extended category-balanced dataset RS-TQA-B. These datasets fill a critical gap in the field while ensuring comprehensiveness, balance, and challenge. Furthermore, we introduce a region-discrimination-guided multimodal copy-move forgery perception framework (CMFPF), which enhances the accuracy of answering questions about tampered images by leveraging prompt about the differences and connections between the source and tampered domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method provides a stronger benchmark for RSCMQA compared to general VQA and RSVQA models. Our datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/shenyedepisa/RSCMQA.</description>
