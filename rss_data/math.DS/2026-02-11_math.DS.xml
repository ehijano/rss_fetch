      <title>Tracking Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents to Robustify Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs), a measure for exponential separation of input perturbations, of deep neural networks within the framework of continuous-depth neural ODEs. We demonstrate that FTLEs are powerful organizers for input-output dynamics, allowing for better interpretability and the comparison of distinct model architectures. We establish a direct connection between Lyapunov exponents and adversarial vulnerability, and propose a novel training algorithm that improves robustness by FTLE regularization. The key idea is to suppress exponents far from zero in the early stage of the input dynamics. This approach enhances robustness and reduces computational cost compared to full-interval regularization, as it avoids a full ``double'' backpropagation.</description>

      <title>Delayed Pattern Formation in Two-Dimensional Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how the interaction between gene expression time delay and domain size governs spatio-temporal pattern formation in a reaction-diffusion system. To investigate these phenomena, we utilize a modified version of the Schnakenberg model called the ligand internalisation (LI) model. In a one-dimensional domain, a linear relationship has been observed between the gene expression time delay and the time it takes for patterns to form. We extend the model to the two-dimensional domain and confirm that a similar relationship holds there as well. However, our exploration reveals a non-monotonic correlation between domain size and the time required for pattern emergence.
  To unravel these dynamics, we consider a range of initial conditions, including random perturbations of the spatially homogeneous steady state and initial conditions from its unstable manifold. We compute a two-parameter chart of patterns with respect to time delay and domain size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize all polynomial Kolmogorov vector fields for which the standard $n$-sphere is invariant. We exhibit completely integrable Kolmogorov vector fields of degree $m$ on $\mathbb{S}^n$ for any $m &gt;2$. Then, we show that there is no cubic Hamiltonian Kolmogorov vector field that makes an odd-dimensional sphere invariant. We examine the conditions under which a cubic Kolmogorov vector field has a Darboux first integral. In many cases, we determine whether they constitute necessary and sufficient conditions. Moreover, we study the complete integrability of cubic Kolmogorov vector fields having an invariant $n$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz Based Spectral Methods for Data-driven Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Toeplitz-based framework for data-driven spectral estimation of linear evolution operators in dynamical systems. Focusing on transfer and Koopman operators from equilibrium trajectories without access to the underlying equations of motion, our method applies Toeplitz filters to the infinitesimal generator to extract eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and spectral measures. Structural prior knowledge, such as self-adjointness or skew-symmetry, can be incorporated by design. The approach is statistically consistent and computationally efficient, leveraging both primal and dual algorithms commonly used in statistical learning. Numerical experiments on deterministic and chaotic systems demonstrate that the framework can recover spectral properties beyond the reach of standard data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Wandering dynamics of transcendental functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any uniformly escaping and wandering dynamics of a holomorphic function on a compact subset of the plane can be realised by a transcendental meromorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$.
  More precisely, let $\varphi$ be a holomorphic function on an open subset of the complex plane, and suppose that $K$ is a compact set such that $\varphi$ and all its iterates $\varphi^n$ are defined on $K$, and $\varphi^n(K)\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$. We prove that there exist a transcendental meromorphic function $f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ and a compact set $\widetilde{K}$ such that the dynamics of $f$ on the orbit of $\widetilde{K}$ is conjugate, via a smooth change of coordinate close to the identity, to that of $\varphi$ on the orbit of $K$. If $K$ does not separate the plane, the function $f$ may be chosen to be entire. If all iterates of $\varphi$ are univalent on $K$, we can take $\widetilde{K}=K$.
  We also prove a similar theorem for oscillating dynamics. Finally, we use our results to answer a number of questions of Benini et al. concerning wandering domains of entire functions.</description>

      <title>Entropy formula for surface diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a $C^r$ ($r&gt;1$) diffeomorphism on a compact surface $M$ with $h_{\rm top}(f)\geq\frac{\lambda^{+}(f)}{r}$ where $\lambda^{+}(f):=\lim_{n\to+\infty}\frac{1}{n}\max_{x\in M}\log \left\|Df^{n}_{x}\right\|$. We establish an equivalent formula for the topological entropy: $$h_{\rm top}(f)=\lim_{n\to+\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log\int_{M}\left\|Df^{n}_{x}\right\|\,dx.$$ Our approach builds on the key ideas developed in the works of Buzzi-Crovisier-Sarig (\emph{Invent. Math.}, 2022) and Burguet (\emph{Ann. Henri Poincar\'e}, 2024) concerning the continuity of the Lyapunov exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an accelerated continuous-time formulation of Adam by modeling it as a second-order integro-differential dynamical system. We relate this inertial nonlocal model to an existing first-order nonlocal Adam flow through an $\alpha$-refinement limit, and we provide Lyapunov-based stability and convergence analyses. We also introduce an Adam-inspired nonlocal Lagrangian formulation, offering a variational viewpoint. Numerical simulations on Rosenbrock-type examples show agreement between the proposed dynamics and discrete Adam.</description>

      <title>From oblique-wave forcing to streak reinforcement: A perturbation-based frequency-response framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a perturbation-based frequency-response framework for analyzing amplification mechanisms that are central to subcritical routes to transition in wall-bounded shear flows. By systematically expanding the input-output dynamics of fluctuations about the laminar base flow with respect to forcing amplitude, we establish a rigorous correspondence between linear resolvent analysis and higher-order nonlinear interactions. At second order, quadratic interactions of unsteady oblique waves generate steady streamwise streaks via the lift-up mechanism. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of these streaks is captured by the second output singular function of the streamwise-constant resolvent operator. At higher orders, nonlinear coupling between oblique waves and induced streaks acts as structured forcing of the laminar linearized dynamics, yielding additional streak components whose relative phase governs reinforcement or attenuation of the leading-order streak response. Our analysis identifies a critical forcing amplitude marking the breakdown of the weakly nonlinear regime, beyond which direct numerical simulations exhibit sustained unsteadiness. We show that this breakdown coincides with the onset of secondary instability, revealing that the nonlinear interactions responsible for streak formation also drive the modal growth central to classical transition theory. The resulting framework provides a mechanistically transparent and computationally efficient description of transition that unifies non-modal amplification, streak formation, and modal instability within a single formulation derived directly from the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of the second Lagrange spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange spectrum $L$ is the set of finite values of the best approximation constants $k(\alpha)=\limsup_{|p|,|q|\to \infty}|q(q\alpha-p)|^{-1}$, where $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q}$. It is a classical result that the pairs $(p,q)$ attaining these approximation constants arise from the convergents $(p_n,q_n)$ of the continued fraction of $\alpha$. Consequently, $k(\alpha)=\limsup_{n\to\infty}|q_n(q_n\alpha-p_n)|^{-1}$. Moreira proved that the function $d(t)=HD(L\cap(-\infty,t))$ where $HD$ denotes Hausdorff dimension, is continuous.
  Second Lagrange spectra are defined analogously to the classical Lagrange spectrum, but are associated with the problem of approximating an irrational number $\alpha$ by rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ that are not convergents of its continued fraction expansion. Two natural definitions arise depending on whether rational multiples $(p,q)=(kp_n,kq_n),k\geq 2$ which represent the same rational numbers as convergents, are allowed or excluded. Based on this distinction, Moshchevitin introduced two second Lagrange spectra, denoted $L_2$ and $L_2^*$.
  We prove that the function $d_2(t)=HD(L_2\cap (-\infty,t))$ is continuous, whereas $d_2^*(t)=HD(L_2^*\cap (-\infty,t))$ is discontinuous and assumes only the values 0 and 1.</description>

      <title>Static class-guided selection of elementary solutions in non-monotone vanishing discount problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized vanishing discount problem for Hamilton--Jacobi equations, removing the standard monotonicity assumption, either in a global sense or when integrated against all Mather measures. Specifically, we consider \[ \lambda a(x)u(x)+H(x,Du(x))-A\lambda=c_0, \] with a suitably chosen constant $A&gt;0$. By appropriately changing the signs of the function $a(x)$ on different static classes associated with $H$, we show that the maximal viscosity solution converges uniformly as $\lambda\to 0^+$ and that all elementary solutions of the stationary equation \[ H(x,Du(x))=c_0 \] can be selected as limits. This provides the first result for selecting multiple viscosity solutions in vanishing discount problems beyond the usual monotonicity and integral assumptions, as long as $a(x)$ is positive on one static class. Our results highlight the crucial role of static classes in controlling the asymptotic behavior of viscosity solutions. Previously, under usual monotonicity assumptions, only a single solution could be selected (as discussed in \cite{GL}), whereas our approach allows controlled selection of multiple solutions via static class-guided discount coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We study holomorphic vector fields whose singular locus contains a local complete intersection smooth positive-dimensional component. We prove global and local formulas expressing the limiting Milnor/Poincare-Hopf contribution along such a component in terms of its embedded scheme structure, and we obtain sharp lower bounds for this contribution under holomorphic perturbations. We provide explicit families show optimality and illustrate how singularities may redistribute between a fixed neighborhood of the component and the part at infinity in projective compactifications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Geometric Structure of Neural Networks and Neural ODEs via Morse Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09351v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated with a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps an affine linear transformation of the input to an affine linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that, depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller than or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that except for a Lebesgue measure zero set in the weight space, each critical point is non-degenerate if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the affine linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and infinite depth cases. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding and universal approximation, i.e., on the exact and approximate representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs.</description>

Abstract: We construct explicit examples of really perverse central configurations in the spatial Newtonian $N$-body problem. A central configuration is called really perverse if it satisfies the central configuration equations for two distinct mass distributions having the same total mass. While such configurations were previously known only in the planar case for large $N$, we prove the existence of spatial really perverse central configurations for $N=27,\dots,55$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on structures and preservation in forced discrete mechanical systems of Routh type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a type of forced discrete mechanical system $(Q,L_d,f_d)$ -- that we name of Routh type -- whose (discrete) time-flow preserves a symplectic structure on $Q\times Q$. That structure arises as the pullback via the forced discrete Legendre transform of the canonical symplectic structure on $T^*Q$ modified by a "magnetic term". One example of this type of system is provided by the Lagrangian reduction of a symmetric (unforced) discrete mechanical system in the Routh style. In this particular case, we do not reduce by the full symmetry group but, rather, by an appropriate isotropy subgroup. In this context, the preserved symplectic structure can be alternatively seen as the Marsden-Weinstein reduction of the canonical symplectic structure $\omega_{L_d}$ on $Q\times Q$.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalized Diffusions using an Energetic Variational Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting governing physical laws from computational or experimental data is crucial across various fields such as fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Many of those physical laws are dissipative due to fluid viscosity or plasma collisions. For such a dissipative physical system, we propose a framework to learn the corresponding laws of the systems based on their energy-dissipation laws, assuming either continuous data (probability density) or discrete data (particles) are available. Our methods offer several key advantages, including their robustness to corrupted/noisy observations, their easy extension to more complex physical systems, and the potential to address higher-dimensional systems. We validate our approaches through representative numerical examples and carefully investigate the impacts of data quantity and data property on model discovery.</description>

      <title>A predator-prey model with age-structured role reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a predator-prey model with an age-structured predator population that exhibits a functional role reversal. The structure of the predator population in our model embodies the ecological concept of an "ontogenetic niche shift," in which a species' functional role changes as it grows. This structure adds complexity to our model but increases its biological relevance. The time evolution of the age-structured predator population is motivated by the Kermack-McKendrick Renewal Equation (KMRE). Unlike KMRE, the predator population's birth and death rate functions depend on the prey population's size. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solutions to the proposed model's initial value problem. The dynamical properties of the proposed model are investigated via Latin Hypercube Sampling in the 15-dimensional space of its parameters. Our Linear Discriminant Analysis suggests that the most influential parameters are the maturation age of the predator and the rate of consumption of juvenile predators by the prey. We carry out a detailed study of the long-term behavior of the proposed model as a function of these two parameters. In addition, we reduce the proposed age-structured model to ordinary and delayed differential equation (ODE and DDE) models. The comparison of the long-term behavior of the ODE, DDE, and the age-structured models with matching parameter settings shows that the age structure promotes the instability of the Coexistence Equilibrium and the emergence of the Coexistence Periodic Attractor.</description>

      <title>An adaptive data sampling strategy for stabilizing dynamical systems via controller inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning stabilizing controllers from data is an important task in engineering applications; however, collecting informative data is challenging because unstable systems often lead to rapidly growing or erratic trajectories. In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic estimates for solutions of inhomogeneous non-divergence diffusion equations with drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of the nonlinear processes modeled by diffusion-transport partial differential equations in non-divergence form with drifts. The solutions are subject to some inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Starting with the reduced linear problem, we obtain the asymptotic estimates for the solutions, as time $t\to\infty$, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the forcing term and boundary data. These are established in both cases when the drifts are uniformly bounded, and unbounded as $t\to\infty$. For the nonlinear problem, we prove the convergence of the solutions under suitable conditions that balance the growth of the nonlinear term with the decay of the data. To take advantage of the diffusion in the non-divergence form, we prove an inhomogeneous version of the Landis-typed Growth Lemma and apply it to successive time-intervals. At each time step, the center for the barrier function is selected carefully to optimize the contracting factor. Our rigorous results show the robustness of the model.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of finite-time Lyapunov exponents for the stochastic Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with quadratic nonlinearities close to a change of stability. To this aim we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs), observing a change of sign based on the interplay between the distance towards the bifurcation and the noise intensity. A technical challenge is to provide a suitable control of the nonlinear terms coupling the dominant and stable modes of the SPDE and of the corresponding linearization. In order to illustrate our results we apply them to the stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative polynomial cohomology and applications to $\textrm L^p$-measure equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantitative version of polynomial cohomology for discrete groups and show that it coincides with usual group cohomology when combinatorial filling functions are polynomially bounded. As an application, we show that Betti numbers of nilpotent groups are invariant by mutually cobounded $\textrm L^p$-measure equivalence. We also use this to obtain new vanishing results for non-cocompact lattices in rank 1 simple Lie groups.</description>
