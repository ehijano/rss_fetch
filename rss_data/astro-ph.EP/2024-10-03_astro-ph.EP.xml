      <title>The DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP). VII. The Strengths of Three Superfast Rotating Main-belt Asteroids from a Preliminary Search of DEEP Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfast rotators (SFRs) are small solar system objects that rotate faster than generally possible for a cohesionless rubble pile. Their rotational characteristics allow us to make inferences about their interior structure and composition. Here, we present the methods and results from a preliminary search for SFRs in the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP) data set. We find three SFRs from a sample of 686 main-belt asteroids, implying an occurrence rate of 0.4 -0.3/+0.1 percent - a higher incidence rate than has been measured by previous studies. We suggest that this high occurrence rate is due to the small sub-kilometer size regime to which DEEP has access: the objects searched here were as small as 500 m. We compute the minimum required cohesive strength for each of these SFRs and discuss the implications of these strengths in the context of likely evolution mechanisms. We find that all three of these SFRs require strengths that are more than that of weak regolith but consistent with many cohesive asteroid strengths reported in the literature. Across the full DEEP data set, we have identified ~70,000 Main-Belt Asteroids and expect ~300 SFRs - a result that will be assessed in a future paper.</description>

      <title>Volatile composition of the HD 169142 disk and its embedded planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of a planet's atmosphere is intricately linked to the chemical makeup of the protoplanetary disk in which it formed. Determining the elemental abundances from key volatiles within disks is therefore essential for establishing connections between the composition of disks and planets. The disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 169142 is a compelling target for such a study due to its molecule-rich nature and the presence of a newly-forming planet between two prominent dust rings. In this work, we probe the chemistry of the HD 169142 disk at small spatial scales, drawing links between the composition of the disk and the planet-accreted gas. Using thermochemical models and archival data, we constrain the elemental abundances of volatile carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. Carbon and oxygen are only moderately depleted from the gas phase relative to their interstellar abundances, with the inner 60 au appearing enriched in volatile oxygen. The C/O ratio is approximately solar within the inner disk and rises above this in the outer disk, as expected across the H2O snowline. The gas-phase sulfur abundance is depleted by a factor of 1000, consistent with a number of other protoplanetary disks. Interestingly, the observed SiS emission near the HD 169142 b protoplanet vastly exceeds chemical model predictions, supporting previous hypotheses suggesting its origin in shocked gas or a localised outflow. We contextualise our findings in terms of the potential atmospheric composition of the embedded planet, and highlight the utility of sulfur-bearing molecules as probes of protoplanetary disk chemistry.</description>

      <title>Generating X-ray transit profiles with batman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adaptation of the exoplanet transit model code batman, in order to permit the generation of X-ray transits. Our underlying extended coronal model assumes an isothermal plasma that is radially symmetric. While this ignores the effect of bright, active regions, observations of transits in X-rays will require averaging across multiple epochs of data for the foreseeable future, significantly reducing the importance of more complex modelling. Our publicly available code successfully generates the predicted W-shaped transit profile in X-rays due to the optically thin nature of the emission, which concentrates the expected observational emission around the limb of the photospheric stellar disc. We provide some examples based on the best known X-ray transit target, HD 189733b, and examine the effect of varying the planet size, coronal temperature, and impact parameter on the resulting transit profile. We also derived scaling relationships for how the overall transit detectability is affected by changing these parameters. Over most of the parameter space, we find that the detectability scales linearly with the cross-sectional area of the planet in X-rays. The relationship with increasing coronal temperature is less fixed, but averages out to a power law with slope $-1/4$ except when the impact parameter is high. Indeed, varying impact parameter has little effect on detectability at all until it approaches unity.</description>

      <title>A Fourth Planet in the Kepler-51 System Revealed by Transit Timing Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kepler-51 is a $\lesssim 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$-old Sun-like star hosting three transiting planets with radii $\approx 6$-$9\,R_\oplus$ and orbital periods $\approx 45$-$130\,\mathrm{days}$. Transit timing variations (TTVs) measured with past Kepler and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations have been successfully modeled by considering gravitational interactions between the three transiting planets, yielding low masses and low mean densities ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$) for all three planets. However, the transit time of the outermost transiting planet Kepler-51d recently measured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 10 years after the Kepler observations is significantly discrepant from the prediction made by the three-planet TTV model, which we confirmed with ground-based and follow-up HST observations. We show that the departure from the three-planet model is explained by including a fourth outer planet, Kepler-51e, in the TTV model. A wide range of masses ($\lesssim M_\mathrm{Jup}$) and orbital periods ($\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{yr}$) are possible for Kepler-51e. Nevertheless, all the coplanar solutions found from our brute-force search imply masses $\lesssim 10\,M_\oplus$ for the inner transiting planets. Thus their densities remain low, though with larger uncertainties than previously estimated. Unlike other possible solutions, the one in which Kepler-51e is around the $2:1$ mean motion resonance with Kepler-51d implies low orbital eccentricities ($\lesssim 0.05$) and comparable masses ($\sim 5\,M_\oplus$) for all four planets, as is seen in other compact multi-planet systems. This work demonstrates the importance of long-term follow-up of TTV systems for probing longer period planets in a system.</description>

      <title>Sea Foam contains Hemoglycin from Cosmic Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-falling cosmic dust has left evidence of meteoritic polymer amide in stromatolites, both fossil and modern. In search of evidence for continued present day in-fall sea foam was collected from two beaches in Rhode Island and subjected to Folch extraction to concentrate amphiphilic components in a chloroform water-methanol interphase layer. Hemoglycin polymer amide molecules previously characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry in meteorites and stromatolites were identified in sea foam either directly, or via their fragmentation patterns. Residual isotope enrichment pointed to an extra-terrestrial origin. The unique resiliency of sea foam may be due to the formation of extended hemoglycin lattices that stabilize its closed-cell structure and its lightness can potentially be explained by photolytic hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Magnetized winds of M-type stars and star-planet magnetic interactions: uncertainties and modeling strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M-type stars are the most common stars in the universe. They are ideal hosts for the search of exoplanets in the habitable zone (HZ), as their small size and low temperature make the HZ much closer in than their solar twins. Harboring very deep convective layers, they also usually exhibit very intense magnetic fields. Understanding their environment, in particular their coronal and wind properties, is thus very important, as they might be very different from what is observed in the solar system. The mass loss rate of M-type stars is poorly known observationally, and recent attempts to estimate it for some of them (TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Cen) can vary by an order of magnitude. In this work, we revisit the stellar wind properties of M-dwarfs in the light of the latest estimates of $\dot{M}$ through Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption at the astropause and slingshot prominences. We outline a modeling strategy to estimate the mass loss rate, radiative loss and wind speed, with uncertainties, based on an Alfv\'en wave driven stellar wind model. We find that it is very likely that several TRAPPIST-1 planets lie within the Alfv\'en surface, which imply that these planets experience star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI). We also find that SPMI between Proxima Cen b and its host star could be the reason of recently observed radio emissions.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent $N$-body simulation of Planetesimal-Driven Migration I. The trajectories of single planets in the uniform background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent exoplanet observations have revealed a diversity of exoplanetary systems, which suggests the ubiquity of radial planetary migration. One powerful known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which can let planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering with planetesimals. In this series of papers, we present the results of our high-resolution self-consistent $N$-body simulations of PDM, in which gravitational interactions among planetesimals, the gas drag, and Type-I migration are all taken into account. In this first paper (Paper I), we investigate the migration of a single planet through PDM within the framework of the classical standard disk model (the Minimum-Mass Solar Nebula model). Paper I aims to improve our understanding of planetary migration through PDM, addressing previously unexplored aspects of both the gravitational interactions among planetesimals and the interactions with disk gas. Our results show that even small protoplanets can actively migrate through PDM. Such active migration can act as a rapid radial diffusion mechanism for protoplanets and significantly influence the early stages of planetary formation (i.e., during the runaway growth phase). Moreover, a fair fraction of planets migrate outward. This outward migration may offer a potential solution for the ``planet migration problem" caused by Type-I migration and gives a natural mechanism for outward migration assumed in many recent scenarios for the formation of outer planets.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the physical origin of large cavities in transition disks from multi-wavelength dust continuum emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms (e.g., a companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multi-wavelength interferometric visibilities of dust continuum observations obtained with ALMA and VLA for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau, and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multi-wavelength data is used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density, maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A, LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S, DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.</description>

      <title>JWST captures a sudden stellar outburst and inner disk wall destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of T~Cha, a highly variable ($\Delta V \sim$3-5\,mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large ($\sim 15$\,au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-infrared spectrum is signiticantly different from the {\it Spitzer} spectrum obtained 17 years before, where the emission at short wavelengths ($5-10 \mu m$) has decreased by $\sim 2/3$ while at longer wavelengths ($15-25 \mu m$) it increased by up to a factor of $\sim 3$. This 'seesaw' behavior is contemporary with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. By analyzing and modelling both SEDs, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that destructed the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower $15-25$\,micron\ emission during the {\it Spitzer} time. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable ($\sim 1/5$) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T~Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020).</description>
