      <title>Intersubjectivity and value reproducibility of outcomes of quantum measurements</title>

Abstract: Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of 'Reversible' and 'Irreversible' Entropy Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.12825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are currently two main, continuum models of entropy: a 'reversible' (Clausius) entropy model and an 'irreversible' (Onsager-Prigogine) entropy model. It is shown that the equations of the 'reversible' and the 'irreversible' entropy models are equivalent with respect to entropy accumulation - which entails same values of entropy change and, thus, same values of entropy. The equivalence of the equations of the 'reversible' and the 'irreversible' entropy models entails that the equations have the same domain, which contradicts the domain of the 'second fundamental equation' of the 'reversible' entropy model, dS = dQ/T, being and the domains of the equations of the 'irreversible' entropy model not being restricted to 'reversible' phenomena. Several examples - conceptual, numerical and by practical engineering software - show that the domain of the equation dS = dQ/T is not restricted to 'reversible' phenomena. This is consistent with no experimental or observational evidence for equation dS = dQ/T not holding true for not 'reversible' phenomena - which is the fundamental proposition of the 'reversible' entropy model. The main implication of the equivalence of the two entropy models is a signification simplification of the language used in the context of entropy modeling.</description>
