      <title>Optimal tables for asymmetric numeral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several algorithms to generate tables for asymmetric numeral systems and prove that they are optimal in terms of discrepancy. In turn, this gives rise to the strongest proven bound on entropy loss. We further give improved theoretical bounds for the entropy loss in tabled asymmetric numeral systems and a brief empirical evaluation of the stream variant.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Algorithmic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic information theory roots the concept of information in computation rather than probability. These lecture notes were constructed in conjunction with the graduate course I taught at Universit\`a della Svizzera italiana in the spring of 2023. The course is intended for graduate students and researchers seeking a self-contained journey from the foundations of computability theory to prefix complexity and the information-theoretic limits of formal systems. My exposition ignores boundaries between computer science, mathematics, physics, and philosophy -- an approach I consider essential when explaining inherently multidisciplinary fields. Lecture recordings are available online. Among other topics, the notes cover bit strings, codes, Shannon information theory, computability theory, the universal Turing machine, the Halting Problem, Rice's Theorem, plain algorithmic complexity, the Invariance Theorem, incompressibility, Solomonoff's induction, self-delimiting Turing machines, prefix algorithmic complexity, the halting probability Omega, Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem, The Coding Theorem, lower semi-computable semi-measures, and the chain rule for algorithmic complexity.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Experimental Validation of UAV Corridor-Assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) corridor-assisted communication networks are expected to expand significantly in the upcoming years driven by several technological, regulatory, and societal trends. In this new type of networks, accurate and realistic channel models are essential for designing reliable, efficient, and secure communication systems. In this paper, an analytical framework is presented that is based on one-dimensional (1D) finite point processes, namely the binomial point process (BPP) and the finite homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), to model the spatial locations of UAV-Base Stations (UAV-BSs). To this end, the shadowing conditions experienced in the UAV-BS-to-ground users links are accurately considered in a realistic maximum power-based user association policy. Subsequently, coverage probability analysis under the two spatial models is conducted, and exact-form expressions are derived. In an attempt to reduce the analytical complexity of the derived expressions, a dominant interferer-based approach is also investigated. Finally, the main outcomes of this paper are extensively validated by empirical data collected in an air-to-ground measurement campaign. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to experimentally verify a generic spatial model by jointly considering the random spatial and shadowing characteristics of a UAV-assisted air-to-ground network.</description>

      <title>Covert Communication Over a Quantum MAC with a Helper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study covert classical communication over a quantum multiple-access channel (MAC) with a helper. Specifically, we consider three transmitters, where one transmitter helps the other two transmitters communicate covertly with a receiver. We demonstrate the feasibility of achieving a positive covert rate over this channel and establish an achievable rate region. Our result recovers as a special case known results for classical communication over classical MACs with a degraded message set, classical communication over quantum MACs, and classical communication over MACs with a helper. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first to achieve covert communication with positive rates over both classical and quantum MACs.</description>

      <title>A Group Theoretic Construction of Batch Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch codes serve as critical tools for load balancing in distributed storage systems. While numerous constructions exist for specific batch sizes t, current methodologies predominantly rely on code dimension parameters, limiting their adaptability. Practical implementations, however, demand versatile batch code designs capable of accommodating arbitrary batch sizes-a challenge that remains understudied in the literature. This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing batch codes through finite groups and their subgroup structures, building on the quasi-uniform group code framework proposed by Chan et al. By leveraging algebraic properties of groups, the proposed method enables systematic code construction, streamlined decoding procedures, and efficient reconstruction of information symbols. Unlike traditional linear codes, quasi-uniform codes exhibit broader applicability due to their inherent structural flexibility.
  Focusing on abelian 2-groups, the work investigates their subgroup lattices and demonstrates their utility in code design-a contribution of independent theoretical interest. The resulting batch codes achieve near-optimal code lengths and exhibit potential for dual application as locally repairable codes (LRCs), addressing redundancy and fault tolerance in distributed systems. This study not only advances batch code construction but also establishes group-theoretic techniques as a promising paradigm for future research in coded storage systems. By bridging algebraic structures with practical coding demands, the approach opens new directions for optimizing distributed storage architectures.</description>

      <title>Cross Far- and Near-Field Beam Management Technologies in Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication toward next-generation networks introduces unprecedented demands on data rates, latency, and connectivity. To meet these requirements, two key trends have emerged: the use of higher communication frequencies to provide broader bandwidth, and the deployment of massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with large antenna arrays to compensate for propagation losses and enhance spatial multiplexing. These advancements significantly extend the Rayleigh distance, enabling near-field (NF) propagation alongside the traditional far-field (FF) regime. As user communication distances dynamically span both FF and NF regions, cross-field (CF) communication has also emerged as a practical consideration. Beam management (BM)-including beam scanning, channel state information estimation, beamforming, and beam tracking-plays a central role in maintaining reliable directional communications. While most existing BM techniques are developed for FF channels, recent works begin to address the unique characteristics of NF and CF regimes. This survey presents a comprehensive review of BM techniques from the perspective of propagation fields. We begin by building the basic through analyzing the modeling of FF, NF, and CF channels, along with the associated beam patterns for alignment. Then, we categorize BM techniques by methodologies, and discuss their operational differences across propagation regimes, highlighting how field-dependent channel characteristics influence design tradeoffs and implementation complexity. In addition, for each BM method, we identify open challenges and future research directions, including extending FF methods to NF or CF scenarios, developing unified BM strategies for field-agnostic deployment, and designing low-overhead BM solutions for dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Expressions for I/O Relation in Zak-OTFS with Different Delay-Doppler Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transceiver operations in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain in Zak-OTFS modulation, including DD domain filtering at the transmitter and receiver, involve twisted convolution operation. The twisted convolution operations give rise to multiple integrals in the end-to-end DD domain input-output (I/O) relation. The I/O relation plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and algorithm development for transceiver implementation. In this paper, we derive discrete DD domain closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. We derive these expressions for sinc and Gaussian pulse shaping DD filters at the transmitter (Tx). On the receiver (Rx) side, three types of DD filters are considered, viz., $(i)$ Rx filter identical to Tx filter (referred to as `identical filtering'), $(ii)$ Rx filter matched to the Tx filter (referred to as `matched filtering'), and $(iii)$ Rx filter matched to both Tx filter and channel response (referred to as `channel matched filtering'). For all the above cases, except for the case of sinc identical filtering, we derive exact I/O relation and noise covariance expressions in closed-form. For the sinc identical filtering case, we derive approximate closed-form expressions which are shown to be accurate. Using the derived closed-form expressions, we evaluate the bit error performance of Zak-OTFS for different Tx/Rx filter configurations. Our results using Vehicular-A (Veh-A) channel model with fractional DDs show that, while matched filtering achieves slightly better or almost same performance as identical filtering, channel matched filtering achieves the best performance among the three.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for MIMO Communication with Low-Resolution ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems conventionally use high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the receiver side to faithfully digitize received signals prior to digital signal processing. However, the power consumption of ADCs increases significantly as the bandwidth is increased, particularly in millimeter wave communications systems. A combination of two mitigating approaches has been considered in the literature: i) to use hybrid beamforming to reduce the number of ADCs, and ii) to use low-resolution ADCs to reduce per ADC power consumption. Lowering the number and resolution of the ADCs naturally reduces the communication rate of the system, leading to a tradeoff between ADC power consumption and communication rate. Prior works have shown that optimizing over the hybrid beamforming matrix and ADC thresholds may reduce the aforementioned rate-loss significantly. A key challenge is the complexity of optimization over all choices of beamforming matrices and threshold vectors. This work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture to perform the optimization. The proposed approach integrates deep neural network-based mutual information estimators for reward calculation with policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning. The approach is robust to dynamic channel statistics and noisy CSI estimates. It is shown theoretically that greedy RL methods converge to the globally optimal policy. Extensive empirical evaluations are provided demonstrating that the performance of the RL-based approach closely matches exhaustive search optimization across the solution space.</description>

      <title>Secret Sharing for DNA Probability Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging DNA storage technologies use composite DNA letters, where information is represented by a probability vector, leading to higher information density and lower synthesis costs. However, it faces the problem of information leakage in sharing the DNA vessels among untrusted vendors. This paper introduces an asymptotic ramp secret sharing scheme (ARSSS) for secret information storage using composite DNA letters. This innovative scheme, inspired by secret sharing methods over finite fields and enhanced with a modified matrix-vector multiplication operation for probability vectors, achieves asymptotic information-theoretic data security for a large alphabet size. Moreover, this scheme reduces the number of reading operations for DNA samples compared to traditional schemes, and therefore lowers the complexity and the cost of DNA-based secret sharing. We further explore the construction of the scheme, starting with a proof of the existence of a suitable generator, followed by practical examples. Finally, we demonstrate efficient constructions to support large information sizes, which utilize multiple vessels for each secret share rather than a single vessel.</description>

      <title>The Masked Matrix Separation Problem: A First Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a known matrix that is the sum of a low rank matrix and a masked sparse matrix, we wish to recover both the low rank component and the sparse component. The sparse matrix is masked in the sense that a linear transformation has been applied on its left. We propose a convex optimization problem to recover the low rank and sparse matrices, which generalizes the robust PCA framework. We provide incoherence conditions for the success of the proposed convex optimizaiton problem, adapting to the masked setting. The ``mask'' matrix can be quite general as long as a so-called restricted infinity norm condition is satisfied. Further analysis on the incoherence condition is provided and we conclude with promising numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>SA-MIMO: Scalable Quantum-Based Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers offer a quantum-native alternative to conventional RF front-ends by directly detecting electromagnetic fields via highly excited atomic states. While their quantum-limited sensitivity and hardware simplicity make them promising for future wireless systems, extending their use to scalable multi-antenna and multi-carrier configurations, termed Scalable Atomic-MIMO (SA-MIMO), remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel RF transmitter-atomic receiver architecture that addresses this gap. The core idea lies in a novel modulation technique called Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading (PRSS), which transforms the nonlinear phase retrieval problem inherent to atomic detection into a tractable linear demultiplexing task. PRSS enables efficient signal processing and supports scalable MUX/DeMUX operations in both atomic MIMO and atomic OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves up to 2.5 dB gain under optimal maximum-likelihood detection and over 10 dB under suboptimal detection in MIMO settings. These results establish PRSS assisted SA-MIMO as a promising architecture for realizing high-sensitivity, interference-resilient atomic wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Generalized Score Matching: Bridging $f$-Divergence and Statistical Estimation Under Correlated Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative Fisher information, also known as score matching, is a recently introduced learning method for parameter estimation. Fundamental relations between relative entropy and score matching have been established in the literature for scalar and isotropic Gaussian channels. This paper demonstrates that such relations hold for a much larger class of observation models. We introduce the vector channel where the perturbation is non-isotropic Gaussian noise. For such channels, we derive new representations that connect the $f$-divergence between two distributions to the estimation loss induced by mismatch at the decoder. This approach not only unifies but also greatly extends existing results from both the isotropic Gaussian and classical relative entropy frameworks. Building on this generalization, we extend De Bruijn's identity to mismatched non-isotropic Gaussian models and demonstrate that the connections to generative models naturally follow as a consequence application of this new result.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction for Sticky Insertion/Deletion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem for insertion/deletion channels has attracted significant attention owing to their applications recently in some emerging data storage systems, such as racetrack memories, DNA-based data storage. Our goal is to investigate the reconstruction problem for sticky-insdel channels where both sticky-insertions and sticky-deletions occur. If there are only sticky-insertion errors, the reconstruction problem for sticky-insertion channel is a special case of the reconstruction problem for tandem-duplication channel which has been well-studied. In this work, we consider the $(t, s)$-sticky-insdel channel where there are at most $t$ sticky-insertion errors and $s$ sticky-deletion errors when we transmit a message through the channel. For the reconstruction problem, we are interested in the minimum number of distinct outputs from these channels that are needed to uniquely recover the transmitted vector. We first provide a recursive formula to determine the minimum number of distinct outputs required. Next, we provide an efficient algorithm to reconstruct the transmitted vector from erroneous sequences.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Analysis for NOMA-Assisted Grant-Free Transmissions with Randomly Arrived Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to grant-free transmissions to reduce the age of information (AoI) in uplink status update systems, where multiple sources upload their {status updates} to {a common} receiver. Unlike existing studies which {adopted} the idealized generate-at-will (GAW) model, {i.e., a status} update data can be generated and transmitted at any time, this paper utilizes a more practical model {to characterize} the inherent randomness of the generation of the status updating data packets. A rigorous analytical framework is established to precisely evaluate the average AoI achieved by the NOMA-assisted grant-free schemes for both {the} cases with and without retransmission. The impact of the choice of the probability {of transmission} on the average AoI is investigated. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of the developed analysis. It is shown that NOMA-assisted schemes are more superior in reducing AoI{, compared} to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based schemes. In addition, compared to schemes without retransmission, the AoI performance {of} the schemes with retransmission can {be improved} significantly when the status update generation rate is low or the user density is relatively high.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19507</link>

Abstract: Data freshness, measured by Age of Information (AoI), is highly relevant in networked applications such as Vehicle to Everything (V2X), smart health systems, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Yet, freshness alone does not equate to informativeness. In decision-critical settings, some stale data may prove more valuable than fresh updates. To explore this nuance, we move beyond AoI-centric policies and investigate how data staleness impacts decision-making under data-staleness-induced uncertainty. We pose a central question: What is the value of information, when freshness fades, and only its power to shape remote decisions remains? To capture this endured value, we propose AR-MDP, an Age-aware Remote Markov Decision Process framework, which co-designs optimal sampling and remote decision-making under a sampling frequency constraint and random delay. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a new two-stage hierarchical algorithm namely Quick Bellman-Linear-Program (QuickBLP), where the first stage involves solving the Dinkelbach root of a Bellman variant and the second stage involves solving a streamlined linear program (LP). For the tricky first stage, we propose a new One-layer Primal-Dinkelbach Synchronous Iteration (OnePDSI) method, which overcomes the re-convergence and non-expansive divergence present in existing per-sample multi-layer algorithms. Through rigorous convergence analysis of our proposed algorithms, we establish that the worst-case optimality gap in OnePDSI exhibits exponential decay with respect to iteration $K$ at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{R^K})$. Through sensitivity analysis, we derive a threshold for the sampling frequency, beyond which additional sampling does not yield further gains in decision-making. Simulation results validate our analyses.</description>

      <title>On Weight Enumeration and Structure Characterization of Polar Codes via Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19544v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a complete characterization of codewords in polar codes with weights less than twice the minimum distance, using the group action of the lower triangular affine (LTA) group. We derive a closed-form formula for the enumeration of such codewords. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced partial order based on weight contributions, offering refined tools for code design. Our results extend previous work on Type II codewords to a full description of Type I codewords and offer new insights into the algebraic structure underlying decreasing monomial codes, including polar and Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Optimal Memory-Rate Tradeoff in Secure Coded Caching for Small Buffer or Small Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the secure coded caching problem proposed by Ravindrakumar et. al where no user can obtain information about files other than the one requested. We first propose three new schemes for the three cases of cache size $M=1$, $N=2$ files and arbitrary $K$ users, delivery rate $ R=1$, arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, and the general case for arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, respectively. Then we derive converse results by characterizing new properties of secure coded caching schemes. As a result, we characterize the two end-points of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve for arbitrary number of users and files. Furthermore, for the case of $N=2$ files and arbitrary number of users, we also characterize a segment of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve, where the cache size is relatively small.</description>

      <title>Sliding Window Adversarial Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC), the channel has a state which is under the control of an adversarial jammer and the corresponding capacities are often functions of the "power" constraints on the transmitter and jammer. In this paper we propose a model in which the constraints must hold almost surely over contiguous subsequences of the codeword and state, which we call a sliding window constraint. We study oblivious jammers and codes with stochastic encoding under maximum probability of error. We show that this extra limitation on the jammer is beneficial for the transmitter: in some cases, the capacity for unique decoding with a sliding window constraint is equal to the capacity for list decoding in the standard model without sliding windows, roughly implying that the addition of window constraints reduces list decoding to unique decoding. The list decoding capacity in the standard model can be strictly larger than the unique decoding capacity.</description>

      <title>Lossy Source Coding with Focal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focal loss has recently gained significant popularity, particularly in tasks like object detection where it helps to address class imbalance by focusing more on hard-to-classify examples. This work proposes the focal loss as a distortion measure for lossy source coding. The paper provides single-shot converse and achievability bounds. These bounds are then used to characterize the distortion-rate trade-off in the infinite blocklength, which is shown to be the same as that for the log loss case. In the non-asymptotic case, the difference between focal loss and log loss is illustrated through a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>An Achievability Bound for Type-Based Unsourced Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an achievability bound to quantify the performance of a type-based unsourced multiple access system -- an information-theoretic model for grant-free multiple access with correlated messages. The bound extends available achievability results for the per-user error probability in the unsourced multiple access framework, where, different from our setup, message collisions are treated as errors. Specifically, we provide an upper bound on the total variation distance between the type (i.e., the empirical probability mass function) of the transmitted messages and its estimate over a Gaussian multiple access channel. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate that our bound can be used to determine the message type that is less efficient to transmit, because more difficult to detect. We finally show that a practical scheme for type estimation, based on coded compressed sensing with approximate message passing, operates approximately 3 dB away from the bound, for the parameters considered in the paper.</description>

      <title>Skew generalized quasi-cyclic codes over non-chain ring $F_q+vF_q$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p$, let $F_q$ be the finite field of order $q= p^d$. This paper presents the study on skew generalized quasi-cyclic (SGQC) codes of length $n$ over the non-chain ring $F_q+vF_q$ where $v^2=v$ and $\theta_t$ is the Galois automorphism. Here, first, we prove the dual of an SGQC code of length $n$ is also an SGQC code of the same length and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a self-dual SGQC code. Then, we discuss the $1$-generator polynomial and the $\rho$-generator polynomial for skew generalized quasi-cyclic codes. Further, we determine the dimension and BCH type bound for the 1-generator skew generalized quasi-cyclic codes. As a by-product, with the help of MAGMA software, we provide a few examples of SGQC codes and obtain some $2$-generator SGQC codes of index $2$.</description>

      <title>Type-Based Unsourced Multiple Access over Fading Channels with Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-based unsourced multiple access (TUMA) is a recently proposed framework for type-based estimation in massive uncoordinated access networks. We extend the existing design of TUMA, developed for an additive white Gaussian channel, to a more realistic environment with fading and multiple antennas. Specifically, we consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system and exploit spatial diversity to estimate the set of transmitted messages and the number of users transmitting each message. Our solution relies on a location-based codeword partition and on the use at the receiver of a multisource approximate message passing algorithm in both centralized and distributed implementations. The proposed TUMA framework results in a robust and scalable architecture for massive machine-type communications.</description>

      <title>Modular Debiasing for Discrete Sources and Quantum Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modular debiasing technique for discrete random sources, addressing the fundamental challenge of extracting high-quality randomness from imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\{0, 1, \dots, m-1\}$. A key result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, critically, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise. Analytical bounds show an exponential rate of convergence, which is empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators, enabling efficient extraction of high-quality randomness from experimentally imperfect sources.</description>

      <title>A Unified MDL-based Binning and Tensor Factorization Framework for PDF Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean classification dataset.</description>

      <title>Projective systems and bounds on the length of codes of non-zero defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their 2007 book, Tsfasman and Vl\v{a}du\c{t} invite the reader to reinterpret existing coding theory results through the lens of projective systems. Redefining linear codes as projective systems provides a geometric vantage point. In this paper, we embrace this perspective, deriving bounds on the lengths of A$^s$MDS codes (codes with Singleton defect $s$). To help frame our discussions, we introduce the parameters $m^{s}(k,q)$, denoting the maximum length of an (non-degenerate) $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code, $m^{s}_t(k,q)$ denoting the maximum length of an (non-degenerate) $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code such that the dual code is an A$^t$MDS code, and $\kappa(s,q)$, representing the maximum dimension $k$ for which there exists a linear code of (maximal) length $n=(s+1)(q+1)+k-2$. In particular, we address a gap in the literature by providing sufficient conditions on $n$ and $k$ under which the dual of an $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code is also an A$^s$MDS code. Our results subsume or improve several results in the literature. Some conjectures arise from our findings.</description>

      <title>Provably Secure Public-Key Steganography Based on Admissible Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technique of hiding secret messages within seemingly harmless covertext to evade examination by censors with rigorous security proofs is known as provably secure steganography (PSS). PSS evolves from symmetric key steganography to public-key steganography, functioning without the requirement of a pre-shared key and enabling the extension to multi-party covert communication and identity verification mechanisms. Recently, a public-key steganography method based on elliptic curves was proposed, which uses point compression to eliminate the algebraic structure of curve points. However, this method has strict requirements on the curve parameters and is only available on half of the points. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a more general elliptic curve public key steganography method based on admissible encoding. By applying the tensor square function to the known well-distributed encoding, we construct admissible encoding, which can create the pseudo-random public-key encryption function. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed provable secure public-key steganography method can be deployed on all types of curves and utilize all points on the curve.</description>

Abstract: We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being recommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike' feedback. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users and items are clustered into types. The model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, as used by item-item and user-user collaborative filtering algorithms. We study the situation in which the type preference matrix has i.i.d. entries. Our main contribution is an algorithm that simultaneously uses both item and user structures, proved to be near-optimal via corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. In particular, our analysis highlights the sub-optimality of using only one of item or user structure (as is done in most collaborative filtering algorithms).</description>

      <title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Aware Load Balancing in Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications, necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.</description>

      <title>Lossy Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed. This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First, by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting the problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively high losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Personalised Mean Estimation for the Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning with heterogeneous data and personalization has received significant recent attention. Separately, robustness to corrupted data in the context of federated learning has also been studied. In this paper we explore combining personalization for heterogeneous data with robustness, where a constant fraction of the clients are corrupted. Motivated by this broad problem, we formulate a simple instantiation which captures some of its difficulty. We focus on the specific problem of personalized mean estimation where the data is drawn from a Gaussian mixture model. We give an algorithm whose error depends almost linearly on the ratio of corrupted to uncorrupted samples, and show a lower bound with the same behavior, albeit with a gap of a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff Based on the Conditional-Distribution Perception Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff for a memoryless source model in the asymptotic limit of large block-lengths. The perception measure is based on a divergence between the distributions of the source and reconstruction sequences \emph{conditioned} on the encoder output, first proposed by Mentzer et al. We consider the case when there is no shared randomness between the encoder and the decoder and derive a single-letter characterization of the RDP function for the case of discrete memoryless sources. This is in contrast to the marginal-distribution metric case (introduced by Blau and Michaeli), whose RDP characterization remains open when there is no shared randomness. The achievability scheme is based on lossy source coding with a posterior reference map. For the case of continuous valued sources under the squared error distortion measure and the squared quadratic Wasserstein perception measure, we also derive a single-letter characterization and show that the decoder can be restricted to a noise-adding mechanism. Interestingly, the RDP function characterized for the case of zero perception loss coincides with that of the marginal metric, and further zero perception loss can be achieved with a 3-dB penalty in minimum distortion. Finally we specialize to the case of Gaussian sources, and derive the RDP function for Gaussian vector case and propose a reverse water-filling type solution. We also partially characterize the RDP function for a mixture of Gaussian vector sources.</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15135v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes were introduced in the work "Function-Correcting Codes" (FCC) by Lenz et al. 2023, which provides a graphical representation for the problem of constructing function-correcting codes. We use this function dependent graph to get a lower bound on the redundancy required for function correction codes. By considering the function to be a bijection, such an approach leads to a lower bound on the redundancy required for classical systematic error correcting codes (ECCs). We propose a range of parameters for which the bound is tight. For single error correcting codes, we show that this bound is at least as good as a bound proposed by Zinoviev, Litsyn, and Laihonen in 1998. Thus, this framework helps to study systematic classical error correcting codes. Further, we study the structure of this function dependent graph for linear functions, which leads to bounds on the redundancy of linear-function correcting codes. We show that the Plotkin-like bound for function-correcting codes proposed by Lenz et.al 2023 is simplified for linear functions. We identify a class of linear functions for which an upper bound proposed by Lenz et al., is tight and also identify a class of functions for which coset-wise coding is equivalent to a lower dimensional classical error correction problem.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay using Combinatorial t-Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantized Compressed Sensing via Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a unified treatment to the recovery of structured signals living in a star-shaped set from general quantized measurements $\mathcal{Q}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\tau})$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a sensing matrix, $\mathbf{\tau}$ is a vector of (possibly random) quantization thresholds, and $\mathcal{Q}$ denotes an $L$-level quantizer. The ideal estimator with consistent quantized measurements is optimal in some important instances but typically infeasible to compute. To this end, we study the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm with respect to the one-sided $\ell_1$-loss and identify the conditions under which PGD achieves the same error rate, up to logarithmic factors. These conditions include estimates of the separation probability, small-ball probability and some moment bounds that are easy to validate. For multi-bit case, we also develop a complementary approach based on product embedding to show global convergence. When applied to popular models such as 1-bit compressed sensing with Gaussian $\mathbf{A}$ and zero $\mathbf{\tau}$ and the dithered 1-bit/multi-bit models with sub-Gaussian $\mathbf{A}$ and uniform dither $\mathbf{\tau}$, our unified treatment yields error rates that improve on or match the sharpest results in all instances. Particularly, PGD achieves the information-theoretic optimal rate $\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{mL})$ for recovering $k$-sparse signals, and the rate $\tilde{O}((\frac{k}{mL})^{1/3})$ for effectively sparse signals. For 1-bit compressed sensing of sparse signals, our result recovers the optimality of normalized binary iterative hard thresholding (NBIHT) that was proved very recently.</description>

      <title>A higher-order Otto calculus approach to the Gaussian completely monotone conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaussian completely monotone (GCM) conjecture states that the $m$-th time-derivative of the entropy along the heat flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is positive for $m$ even and negative for $m$ odd. We prove the GCM conjecture for orders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any dimension. Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno's formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Joint Detection and Decoding: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrowing the performance gap between optimal and feasible detection in inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels, this paper proposes to use graph neural networks (GNNs) for detection that can also be used to perform joint detection and decoding (JDD). For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the robustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver. Additionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN independent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep learning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns out to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations and codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain compared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages between nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation in a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at first glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible non-neural baseline.</description>

Abstract: We study cooperation problems in broadcast and relay networks, where the receivers do not satisfy the classical physical degradedness assumptions. New notions of degradedness, strongly less noisy and strongly more capable are introduced. We show that under these conditions, decode and forward (D&amp;F) is optimal for classes of cooperative systems with limited conference rates, thus yielding new capacity results for these systems. In particular, we derive bounds on the capacity region of a class of broadcast channels with cooperation, that are tight on part of the capacity region. It is shown that the cut-set bound is tight for classes of primitive relay and diamond channels, beyond the physically or stochastically degraded models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Clustered Hypotheses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an active Decision-Maker (DM) is tasked to identify the true hypothesis using as few as possible observations while maintaining accuracy. The DM collects observations according to its determined actions and knows the distributions under each hypothesis. We propose a deterministic and adaptive multi-stage hypothesis-elimination strategy where the DM selects an action, applies it repeatedly, and discards hypotheses in light of its obtained observations. The DM selects actions based on maximal separation expressed by the distance between the parameter vectors of each distribution under each hypothesis. Close distributions can be clustered, simplifying the search and significantly reducing the number of required observations.
  Our algorithms achieve vanishing Average Bayes Risk (ABR) as the error probability approaches zero, i.e., the algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Furthermore, we show that the ABR is bounded when the number of hypotheses grows. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the algorithm's performance compared to another multi-stage hypothesis-elimination algorithm, where an improvement of several orders of magnitude in the mean number of observations required is observed.</description>

      <title>Improved Decoding of Tanner Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present improved decoding algorithms for expander-based Tanner codes.
  We begin by developing a randomized linear-time decoding algorithm that, under the condition that $ \delta d_0 &gt; 2 $, corrects up to $ \alpha n $ errors for a Tanner code $ T(G, C_0) $, where $ G $ is a $ (c, d, \alpha, \delta) $-bipartite expander with $n$ left vertices, and $ C_0 \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^d $ is a linear inner code with minimum distance $ d_0 $. This result improves upon the previous work of Cheng, Ouyang, Shangguan, and Shen (RANDOM 2024), which required $ \delta d_0 &gt; 3 $.
  We further derandomize the algorithm to obtain a deterministic linear-time decoding algorithm with the same decoding radius. Our algorithm improves upon the previous deterministic algorithm of Cheng et al. by achieving a decoding radius of $ \alpha n $, compared with the previous radius of $ \frac{2\alpha}{d_0(1 + 0.5c\delta) }n$.
  Additionally, we investigate the size-expansion trade-off introduced by the recent work of Chen, Cheng, Li, and Ouyang (IEEE TIT 2023), and use it to provide new bounds on the minimum distance of Tanner codes. Specifically, we prove that the minimum distance of a Tanner code $T(G,C_0)$ is approximately $f_\delta^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{d_0} \right) \alpha n $, where $ f_\delta(\cdot) $ is the Size-Expansion Function. As another application, we improve the decoding radius of our decoding algorithms from $\alpha n$ to approximately $f_\delta^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{d_0}\right)\alpha n$.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Information Freshness of IEEE 802.11ax Uplink OFDMA-Based Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest WiFi standard, IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6), introduces a novel uplink random access mechanism called uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based random access (UORA). While existing work has evaluated the performance of UORA using conventional performance metrics, such as throughput and delay, its information freshness performance has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. This is of practical significance as WiFi 6 and beyond are expected to support real-time applications. This paper presents the first attempt to fill this gap by investigating the information freshness, quantified by the Age of Information (AoI) metric, in UORA networks. We establish an analytical framework comprising two discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) to characterize the transmission states of stations (STAs) in UORA networks. Building on the formulated DTMCs, we derive an analytical expression for the long-term average AoI (AAoI), facilitating the optimization of UORA parameters for enhanced AoI performance through exhaustive search. To gain deeper design insights and improve the effectiveness of UORA parameter optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the AAoI and its approximated lower bound for a simplified scenario characterized by a fixed backoff contention window and generate-at-will status updates. By analyzing the approximated lower bound of the AAoI, we propose efficient UORA parameter optimization algorithms that can be realized with only a few comparisons of different possible values of the parameters to be optimized. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the AAoI achieved through our proposed parameter optimization algorithm closely approximates the optimal AoI performance obtained via exhaustive search, outperforming the round-robin and max-AoI policies in large and low-traffic networks.</description>

      <title>Blank Space: Adaptive Causal Coding for Streaming Communications Over Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Blank Space AC-RLNC (BS), a novel Adaptive and Causal Network Coding (AC-RLNC) solution designed to mitigate the triplet trade-off between throughput-delay-efficiency in multi-hop networks. BS leverages the network's physical limitations considering the bottleneck from each node to the destination. In particular, BS introduces a light-computational re-encoding algorithm, called Network AC-RLNC (NET), implemented independently at intermediate nodes. NET adaptively adjusts the Forward Error Correction (FEC) rates and schedules idle periods. It incorporates two distinct suspension mechanisms: 1) Blank Space Period, accounting for the forward-channels bottleneck, and 2) No-New No-FEC approach, based on data availability. The experimental results achieve significant improvements in resource efficiency, demonstrating a 20% reduction in channel usage compared to baseline RLNC solutions. Notably, these efficiency gains are achieved while maintaining competitive throughput and delay performance, ensuring improved resource utilization does not compromise network performance.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Meets RIS: Random Matrix Analysis and Two-Timescale Design for Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FASs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provides significant flexibility in optimizing channel conditions by jointly adjusting the positions of fluid antennas and the phase shifts of RISs. However, it is challenging to acquire the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) for both fluid antennas and RISs, while frequent adjustment of antenna positions and phase shifts will significantly increase the system complexity. To tackle this issue, this paper investigates the two-timescale design for FAS-RIS multi-user systems with linear precoding, where only the linear precoder design requires instantaneous CSI of the end-to-end channel, while the FAS and RIS optimization relies on statistical CSI. The main challenge comes from the complex structure of channel and inverse operations in linear precoding, such as regularized zero-forcing (RZF) and zero-forcing (ZF). Leveraging on random matrix theory (RMT), we first investigate the fundamental limits of FAS-RIS systems with RZF/ZF precoding by deriving the ergodic sum rate (ESR). This result is utilized to determine the minimum number of activated antennas to achieve a given ESR. Based on the evaluation result, we propose an algorithm to jointly optimize the antenna selection, regularization factor of RZF, and phase shifts at the RIS. Numerical results validate the accuracy of performance evaluation and demonstrate that the performance gain brought by joint FAS and RIS design is more pronounced with a larger number of users.</description>

      <title>Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Constrained Error-Correcting Codes for Efficient DNA Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA synthesis is considered as one of the most expensive components in current DNA storage systems. In this paper, focusing on a common synthesis machine, which generates multiple DNA strands in parallel following a fixed supersequence,we propose constrained codes with polynomial-time encoding and decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing works, our codes simultaneously satisfy both l-runlength limited and {\epsilon}-balanced constraints. By enumerating all valid sequences, our codes achieve the maximum rate, matching the capacity. Additionally, we design constrained error-correcting codes capable of correcting one insertion or deletion in the obtained DNA sequence while still adhering to the constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Redundancy of Function-Correcting Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes (FCCs) protect specific function evaluations of a message against errors. This condition imposes a less stringent distance requirement than classical error-correcting codes (ECCs), allowing for reduced redundancy. FCCs were introduced by Lenz et al. (2021), who also established a lower bound on the optimal redundancy for FCCs over the binary field. Here, we derive an upper bound within a logarithmic factor of this lower bound. We show that the same lower bound holds for any finite field. Moreover, we show that this bound is tight for sufficiently large fields by demonstrating that it also serves as an upper bound. Furthermore, we construct an encoding scheme that achieves this optimal redundancy. Finally, motivated by these two extreme regimes, we conjecture that our bound serves as a valid upper bound across all finite fields.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of sixth-generation and beyond communication systems is expected to fundamentally transform digital experiences through introducing unparalleled levels of intelligence, efficiency, and connectivity. A promising technology poised to enable this revolutionary vision is the wireless large AI model (WLAM), characterized by its exceptional capabilities in data processing, inference, and decision-making. In light of these remarkable capabilities, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of WLAM, elucidating its fundamental principles, diverse applications, critical challenges, and future research opportunities. We begin by introducing the background of WLAM and analyzing the key synergies with wireless networks, emphasizing the mutual benefits. Subsequently, we explore the foundational characteristics of WLAM, delving into their unique relevance in wireless environments. Then, the role of WLAM in optimizing wireless communication systems across various use cases and the reciprocal benefits are systematically investigated. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of WLAM with emerging technologies, highlighting their potential to enable transformative capabilities and breakthroughs in wireless communication. Finally, we thoroughly examine the high-level challenges hindering the practical implementation of WLAM and discuss pivotal future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting low-dimensional summary statistics from large datasets is essential for efficient (likelihood-free) inference. We characterize different classes of summaries and demonstrate their importance for correctly analysing dimensionality reduction algorithms. We demonstrate that minimizing the expected posterior entropy (EPE) under the prior predictive distribution of the model subsumes many existing methods. They are equivalent to or are special or limiting cases of minimizing the EPE. We offer a unifying framework for obtaining informative summaries, provide concrete recommendations for practitioners, and propose a practical method to obtain high-fidelity summaries whose utility we demonstrate for both benchmark and practical examples.</description>

Abstract: Upper bounds on the minimum Lee distance of codes that are linear over ${\mathbb Z}_q$, $q=p^t$, $p$ prime are discussed. The bounds are Singleton like, depending on the length, rank, and alphabet size of the code. Codes meeting such bounds are referred to as Maximum Lee Distance with respect to Rank (MLDR) Codes. We present some new bounds on MLDR codes, using combinatorial arguments. In the context of MLDR codes, our work provides improvements over existing bounds in the literature</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\ge3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is needed for a guaranteed recovery of \emph{any} state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <title>Online Clustering with Bandit Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online clustering within the multi-armed bandit framework under the fixed confidence setting. In this multi-armed bandit problem, we have $M$ arms, each providing i.i.d. samples that follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with an {\em unknown} mean and a known unit covariance. The arms are grouped into $K$ clusters based on the distance between their means using the Single Linkage (SLINK) clustering algorithm on the means of the arms. Since the true means are unknown, the objective is to obtain the above clustering of the arms with the minimum number of samples drawn from the arms, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. We introduce a novel algorithm, Average Tracking Bandit Online Clustering (ATBOC), and prove that this algorithm is order optimal, meaning that the upper bound on its expected sample complexity for given error probability $\delta$ is within a factor of 2 of an instance-dependent lower bound as $\delta \rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, we propose a computationally more efficient algorithm, Lower and Upper Confidence Bound-based Bandit Online Clustering (LUCBBOC), inspired by the LUCB algorithm for best arm identification. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of LUCBBOC is comparable to that of ATBOC. We numerically assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments on both synthetic datasets and the real-world MovieLens dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on bandit online clustering that allows arms with different means in a cluster and $K$ greater than 2.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient method to reduce error floors in quantum error correction using non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We identify and classify cycle structures in the parity-check matrix where estimated noise becomes trapped, and develop tailored decoding methods for each cycle type. For Type-I cycles, we propose a method to make the difference between estimated and true noise degenerate. Type-II cycles are shown to be uncorrectable, while for Type-III cycles, we utilize the fact that cycles in non-binary LDPC codes do not necessarily correspond to codewords, allowing us to estimate the true noise. Our method significantly improves decoding performance and reduces error floors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate mobile device localization is critical for emerging 5G/6G applications such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. In this paper, we propose a unified localization method that integrates model-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods to reap their respective advantages by exploiting available map information. In order to avoid supervised learning, we generate training labels automatically via optimal transport (OT) by fusing geometric estimates with building layouts. Ray-tracing based simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves positioning accuracy for both line-of-sight (LoS) users (compared to ML-based methods) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) users (compared to model-based methods). Remarkably, the unified method is able to achieve competitive overall performance with the fully-supervised fingerprinting, while eliminating the need for cumbersome labeled data measurement and collection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction with Girth-16 Non-Binary LDPC Codes via Affine Permutation Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on non-binary low-density parity-check codes with Tanner graph girth 16. While conventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices are limited to girth 12, our method employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection procedure to eliminate short cycles and achieve girth 16.
  Numerical experiments show that the proposed codes significantly reduce the number of low-weight codewords. Joint belief propagation decoding over depolarizing channels reveals that although a slight degradation appears in the waterfall region, a substantial improvement is achieved in the error floor performance.
  We also evaluated the minimum distance and found that the proposed codes achieve a larger upper bound compared to conventional constructions.</description>
