      <title>Diffusion-Based Joint Temperature and Precipitation Emulation of Earth System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth system models (ESMs) are the principal tools used in climate science to generate future climate projections under various atmospheric emissions scenarios on a global or regional scale. Generative deep learning approaches are suitable for emulating these tools due to their computational efficiency and ability, once trained, to generate realizations in a fraction of the time required by ESMs. We extend previous work that used a generative probabilistic diffusion model to emulate ESMs by targeting the joint emulation of multiple variables, temperature and precipitation, by a single diffusion model. Joint generation of multiple variables is critical to generate realistic samples of phenomena resulting from the interplay of multiple variables. The diffusion model emulator takes in the monthly mean-maps of temperature and precipitation and produces the daily values of each of these variables that exhibit statistical properties similar to those generated by ESMs. Our results show the outputs from our extended model closely resemble those from ESMs on various climate metrics including dry spells and hot streaks, and that the joint distribution of temperature and precipitation in our sample closely matches those of ESMs.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Computing in the GRIST Dynamical Core for Weather and Climate Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmosphere modelling applications become increasingly memory-bound due to the inconsistent development rates between processor speeds and memory bandwidth. In this study, we mitigate memory bottlenecks and reduce the computational load of the GRIST dynamical core by adopting the mixed-precision computing strategy. Guided by a limited-degree of iterative development principle, we identify the equation terms that are precision insensitive and modify them from double- to single-precision. The results show that most precision-sensitive terms are predominantly linked to pressure-gradient and gravity terms, while most precision-insensitive terms are advective terms. The computational cost is reduced without compromising the solver accuracy. The runtime of the model's hydrostatic solver, non-hydrostatic solver, and tracer transport solver is reduced by 24%, 27%, and 44%, respectively. A series of idealized tests, real-world weather and climate modelling tests, has been performed to assess the optimized model performance qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, in the high-resolution weather forecast simulation, the model sensitivity to the precision level is mainly dominated by the small-scale features. While in long-term climate simulation, the precision-induced sensitivity can form at the large scale.</description>

      <title>Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in earlier numerical methods, whereas they are employed nowadays to an increasing extent in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Spectral Element Method (SEM). We consider here a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivities of a Wind-driven Baroclinic Ocean Using Neural Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical models of the ocean and ice sheets are crucial for understanding and simulating the impact of greenhouse gases on the global climate. Oceanic processes affect phenomena such as hurricanes, extreme precipitation, and droughts. Ocean models rely on subgrid-scale parameterizations that require calibration and often significantly affect model skill. When model sensitivities to parameters can be computed by using approaches such as automatic differentiation, they can be used for such calibration toward reducing the misfit between model output and data. Because the SOMA model code is challenging to differentiate, we have created neural network-based surrogates for estimating the sensitivity of the ocean model to model parameters. We first generated perturbed parameter ensemble data for an idealized ocean model and trained three surrogate neural network models. The neural surrogates accurately predicted the one-step forward ocean dynamics, of which we then computed the parametric sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Assessing wind energy's potential for Kentucky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a push by countries to diversify their energy mix considering various factors. In this regard, there have been several studies conducted to assess the potential for using sources such as wind and solar to generate supplemental energy to the already present energy generation setup. In this regard, this study explores the potential of wind for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. To perform this study, wind data was sourced for eight locations across Kentucky from the publicly accessible wind speed information present at Weatherunderground for the years 2020-2021. An analysis was performed concerning the seasonal, monthly and hourly variation in the wind speed so as to identify the expected times of sufficient wind energy generation. Moreover, a comparison of the collected data was performed with data from a home-based weather station and a deployed wind turbine as well to validate the variation pattern of the publicly sourced data. Finally, in order to investigate the variation patterns of wind and solar energy sources, a comparative analysis was also performed using data from a solar power generation plant in Kentucky. It was observed that a seasonal and monthly complemetarity was observed between the wind and solar. However, when considering daily patterns, the wind was found to follow solar generation with an offset. While further research is required, this analysis indicates that it is possible to deploy wind energy power generation projects in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The seasonal complementary behavior of wind and solar can be used along with battery storage in conjunction with natural gas to provide a diversified electricity generation portfolio.</description>

      <title>A Review on Machine Learning Algorithms for Dust Aerosol Detection using Satellite Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust storms are associated with certain respiratory illnesses across different areas in the world. Researchers have devoted time and resources to study the elements surrounding dust storm phenomena. This paper reviews the efforts of those who have investigated dust aerosols using sensors onboard of satellites using machine learning-based approaches. We have reviewed the most common issues revolving dust aerosol modeling using different datasets and different sensors from a historical perspective. Our findings suggest that multi-spectral approaches based on linear and non-linear combinations of spectral bands are some of the most successful for visualization and quantitative analysis; however, when researchers have leveraged machine learning, performance has been improved and new opportunities to solve unique problems arise.</description>

      <title>Turbulent ice-ocean boundary layers in the well-mixed regime: insights from direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The meltwater mixing line (MML) model provides a theoretical prediction of near-ice water mass properties that is useful to compare with observations. If oceanographic measurements reported in a temperature-salinity diagram overlap with the MML prediction, then it is usually concluded that the local dynamics are dominated by the turbulent mixing of an ambient water mass with nearby melting ice. While the MML model is consistent with numerous observations, it is built on an assumption that is difficult to test with field measurements, especially near the ice boundary, namely that the effective (turbulent and molecular) salt and temperature diffusivities are equal. In this paper, this assumption is tested via direct numerical simulations of a canonical model for externally-forced ice-ocean boundary layers in a uniform ambient. We focus on the well-mixed regime by considering an ambient temperature close to freezing and run the simulations until a statistical steady state is reached. The results validate the assumption of equal effective diffusivities across most of the boundary layer. Importantly, the validity of the MML model implies a linear correlation between the mean salinity and temperature profiles normal to the interface that can be leveraged to construct a reduced ice-ocean boundary layer model based on a single scalar variable called thermal driving. We demonstrate that the bulk dynamics predicted by the reduced thermal driving model are in good agreement with the bulk dynamics predicted by the full temperature-salinity model. Then, we show how the results from the thermal driving model can be used to estimate the interfacial heat and salt fluxes, and the melt rate.</description>

      <title>Calculating radio emissions of positive streamer phenomena using 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study radio emissions from positive streamers in air using 3D simulations, from which the radiated electric field is computed by solving Jefimenko's equations. The simulations are performed at 0.5 bar using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer-streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharges evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high-frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, for example present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest-frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment.</description>

      <title>Interpretable multiscale Machine Learning-Based Parameterizations of Convection for ICON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to improve climate projections, machine learning (ML)-based parameterizations have been developed for Earth System Models (ESMs) with the goal to better represent subgrid-scale processes or to accelerate computations by emulating existent parameterizations. These data-driven models have shown some success in approximating subgrid-scale processes. However, most studies have used a particular machine learning method to parameterize the subgrid tendencies or fluxes originating from the compound effect of various small-scale processes (e.g., turbulence, radiation, convection, gravity waves) in mostly idealized settings or from superparameterizations. Here, we use a filtering technique to explicitly separate convection from these processes in data produced by the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic modelling framework (ICON) in a realistic setting. We use a method improved by incorporating density fluctuations for computing the subgrid fluxes and compare various different machine learning algorithms to predict these fluxes. We further examine the predictions of the best performing non-deep learning model (Gradient Boosted Tree regression) and the best deep-learning model (U-Net). We discover that the U-Net learns non-causal relations between convective precipitation and convective subgrid fluxes and develop an ablated model excluding precipitating tracer species. We connect the learned relations of the U-Net to physical processes in contrast to non-deep learning-based algorithms. The ML schemes are coupled online to the host ICON model and the non-causal links reveal weaknesses in stability and precipitation predictions. Predicted precipitation extremes of the ablated U-Net show higher accuracy over the conventional convection parameterization. Thus, our results provide a significant advance upon existing ML subgrid representation in ESMs.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and Parameterization Inference with Uncertainty Quantification through Differentiable Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations with uncertainty quantification. Our framework incorporates online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, facilitated by differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</description>
