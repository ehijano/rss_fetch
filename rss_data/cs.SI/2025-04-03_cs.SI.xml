      <title>Estimating Hourly Neighborhood Population Using Mobile Phone Data in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional population estimation techniques often fail to capture the dynamic fluctuations inherent in urban and rural population movements. Recognizing the need for a high spatiotemporal dynamic population dataset, we propose a method using smartphone-based human mobility data to reconstruct the hourly population for each neighborhood across the US. We quantify population fluctuations on an hourly, diurnal, daily, and seasonal basis, and compare these with static population data to highlight the limitations of traditional models in capturing temporal dynamics. This study is one of the first hourly population products at a large geographic extent (US), contributing to various studies that involve dynamic populations with high spatiotemporal resolution, such as air pollution exposure analysis and emergency response.</description>

      <title>Method for Mitigating Attention to Inappropriate Content Based on Attention Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of the attention economy has led to the growing issue of inappropriate content being posted by profit-driven users. Previous countermeasures against inappropriate content have relied on moderation, which raises ethical concerns, or information diffusion control, which requires considering larger scale networks, including general users. This study proposes an imitation strategy as an intervention method that does not rely on moderation and focuses on a relatively smaller scale competitive network of information disseminators rather than the entire social network. The imitation strategy is a novel approach that utilizes increased competition among information disseminators through imitation to reduce attention to inappropriate content. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, I demonstrate that the imitation strategy is more effective when nodes with higher eigenvector centrality are selected as targets and nodes with lower eigenvector centrality are chosen as imitators.</description>

      <title>A Novel Dynamic Epidemic Model for Successive Opinion Diffusion in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic epidemic model for successive opinion diffusion in social networks, extending the SHIMR model. It incorporates dynamic decision-making influenced by social distances and captures accumulative opinion diffusion caused by interrelated rumors. The model reflects the impact of rumor spread on social network structures. Simulations validate its effectiveness in explaining phenomena like the echo chamber effect and provide insights into opinion diffusion dynamics, with implications for understanding social polarization and network evolution.</description>

      <title>Recovering Small Communities in the Planted Partition Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze community recovery in the planted partition model (PPM) in regimes where the number of communities is arbitrarily large. We examine the three standard recovery regimes: exact recovery, almost exact recovery, and weak recovery. When communities vary in size, traditional accuracy- or alignment-based metrics become unsuitable for assessing the correctness of a predicted partition. To address this, we redefine these recovery regimes using the correlation coefficient, a more versatile metric for comparing partitions. We then demonstrate that \emph{Diamond Percolation}, an algorithm based on common-neighbors, successfully recovers communities under mild assumptions on edge probabilities, with minimal restrictions on the number and sizes of communities. As a key application, we consider the case where community sizes follow a power-law distribution, a characteristic frequently found in real-world networks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first recovery results for such unbalanced partitions.</description>

      <title>Graph sub-sampling for divide-and-conquer algorithms in large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06994v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As networks continue to increase in size, current methods must be capable of handling large numbers of nodes and edges in order to be practically relevant. Instead of working directly with the entire (large) network, analyzing sub-networks has become a popular approach. Due to a network's inherent inter-connectedness, however, sub-sampling is not a trivial task. While this problem has gained popularity in recent years, it has not received sufficient attention from the statistics community. In this work, we provide a thorough comparison of seven graph sub-sampling algorithms by applying them to divide-and-conquer algorithms for community structure and core-periphery (CP) structure. After discussing the various algorithms and sub-sampling routines, we derive theoretical results for the mis-classification rate of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for CP structure under various sub-sampling schemes. We then perform extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data to compare the various methods. For the community detection task, we found that sampling nodes uniformly at random yields the best performance, but that sometimes the base algorithm applied to the entire network yields better results both in terms of identification and computational time. For CP structure on the other hand, there was no single winner, but algorithms which sampled core nodes at a higher rate consistently outperformed other sampling routines, e.g., random edge sampling and random walk sampling. Unlike community detection, the CP divide-and-conquer algorithm tends to yield better identification results while also being faster than the base algorithm. The varying performance of the sampling algorithms on different tasks demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting a sub-sampling routine for the specific application.</description>

      <title>SEAGET: Seasonal and Active hours guided Graph Enhanced Transformer for the next POI recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important challenges for improving personalized services in industries like tourism is predicting users' near-future movements based on prior behavior and current circumstances. Next POI (Point of Interest) recommendation is essential for helping users and service providers by providing personalized recommendations. The intricacy of this work, however, stems from the requirement to take into consideration several variables at once, such as user preferences, time contexts, and geographic locations. POI selection is also greatly influenced by elements like a POI's operational status during desired visit times, desirability for visiting during particular seasons, and its dynamic popularity over time. POI popularity is mostly determined by check-in frequency in recent studies, ignoring visitor volumes, operational constraints, and temporal dynamics. These restrictions result in recommendations that are less than ideal and do not take into account actual circumstances. We propose the Seasonal and Active hours-guided Graph-Enhanced Transformer (SEAGET) model as a solution to these problems. By integrating variations in the seasons, operational status, and temporal dynamics into a graph-enhanced transformer framework, SEAGET capitalizes on redefined POI popularity. This invention gives more accurate and context-aware next POI predictions, with potential applications for optimizing tourist experiences and enhancing location-based services in the tourism industry.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of leadership and success in software development teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From science to industry, teamwork plays a crucial role in knowledge production and innovation. Most studies consider teams as static groups of individuals, thereby failing to capture how the micro-dynamics of collaborative processes and organizational changes determine team success. Here, we leverage fine-grained temporal data on software development teams from three software ecosystems -- Rust, JavaScript, and Python -- to gain insights into the dynamics of online collaborative projects. Our analysis reveals an uneven workload distribution in teams, with stronger heterogeneity correlated with higher success, and the early emergence of a lead developer carrying out the majority of work. Moreover, we find that a sizeable fraction of projects experience a change of lead developer, with such a transition being more likely in projects led by inexperienced users. Finally, we show that leadership change is associated with faster success growth. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the link between team evolution and success in collaborative processes.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00490v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</description>

      <title>Cortical network reconfiguration aligns with shifts of basal ganglia and cerebellar influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mammalian functional architecture flexibly adapts, transitioning from integration where information is distributed across the cortex, to segregation where information is focal in densely connected communities of brain regions. This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role.</description>
