      <title>Allelopathy of Rumex spp.: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genus of Rumex from the Polygonaceae family is widespread in the world, particularly in the northern hemisphere, and includes about 250 species. The species of this genus are used for medicinal purposes and their allelopathic impacts. Regarding allelopathy, many allelochemicals have been detected in different Rumex species. Therefore, plant extracts, leachates, and plant residues of different species of Rumex have been studied with seed germination and plant growth in the recipient plants. Also, various species of Rumex were tested for their allelopathic capacities to control weeds, insects, and plant pathogens. Besides, it was revealed that the allelopathic impact of Rumex spp. was variable depending on extract concentration, the plant part of the Rumex spp., and the species of the recipient plant. In the present review, the results of the studies are exhibited that aimed at the allelopathic effect on different aspects of the plant crops, weeds, insects, and plant pathogens.</description>

      <title>Growth, yield and quality response of two industrial potato cultivars to chelated potassium and humic acid during fall season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study was carried out to known the response of two industrial potato cultivars (Hermes, and Challenger) Netherlands origin, to chelated potassium fertilizer and humic acid due to growth, yield and quality in the fall season of 2024, planted in an open field of the educational field of Horticulture Department, College of Agricultural Engineering Sciences, University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan region, Iraq, with a (GPS) reading (latitude: 35.53576 N, longitude: 45.36663 E), and an Altitude of (741 m) above sea level. A factorial randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications was used in this study.</description>
