      <title>Quantum advantage without exponential concentration: Trainable kernels for symmetry-structured data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods promise enhanced expressivity for learning structured data, but their usefulness has been limited by kernel concentration and barren plateaus. Both effects are mathematically equivalent and suppress trainability. We analytically prove that covariant quantum kernels tailored to datasets with group symmetries avoid exponential concentration, ensuring stable variance and guaranteed trainability independent of system size. Our results extend beyond prior two-coset constructions to arbitrary coset families, broadening the scope of problems where quantum kernels can achieve advantage. We further derive explicit bounds under coherent noise models - including unitary errors in fiducial state preparation, imperfect unitary representations, and perturbations in group element selection - and show through numerical simulations that the kernel variance remains finite and robust, even under substantial noise. These findings establish a family of quantum learning models that are simultaneously trainable, resilient to coherent noise, and linked to classically hard problems, positioning group-symmetric quantum kernels as a promising foundation for near-term and scalable quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Clock Attention for Aligning Continuous and Ordered Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity, which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative \emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form, Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth, near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal modeling.</description>

      <title>QCD Theory meets Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte-Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, our reweighted Monte Carlo incorporates systematic uncertainties absent in individual Monte Carlo predictions, achieving consistency with the theory input in precision and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.</description>
