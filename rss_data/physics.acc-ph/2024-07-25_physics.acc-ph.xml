      <title>Quantitative description and correction of longitudinal drifts in the Fermilab linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) Linac accepts 750 keV H- ions from the front end and accelerates them to 400 MeV for injection into the Booster rapid cycling synchrotron. Day-to-day drifts in the beam longitudinal trajectory during regular operation are of the order of several degrees. They are believed to cause additional losses in both the Linac and the Booster and are addressed by empirically adjusting cavity phases of front end and Linac RF cavities. This work explores a scheme for expressing these drifts in terms of phase shifts in the low-energy part of the Linac. Such a description allows for a simplified visual representation of the drifts, suggests a clear algorithm for their compensation, and provides a tool for estimating efficiency of such compensation.</description>

      <title>Development of Rotating Target with Ferrofluid Seal for ILC Electron-Driven Positron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ILC electron-driven positron source, acceleration tubes are located immediately downstream of the positron generation target to capture the generated positrons, necessitating high vacuum for their operation. We designed a rotating target using a ferrofluid rotating vacuum seal that can stably maintain a vacuum of $10^{-6}$ Pa and a tangential velocity of 5 m/sec, which meets the requirements of the ILC positron source. We fabricated a full-scale prototype and confirmed the compatibility of rotation and stable vacuum maintenance. Various tests on the radiation resistance of the ferrofluid demonstrated its ability to withstand six years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation without degradation and to continue exhibiting vacuum sealing performance. Radiation exposure tests on a small-scale target with a structure and material similar to the full-scale target confirmed its operability after two years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation. The design, including thermal load, stress analysis, and cooling, led to the conclusion of an estimated lifespan of the target of over one year, based on comparison with the SLC target. These results demonstrate and establish the technology of positron generation targets in the ILC electron-driven positron source.</description>

      <title>Klystron type X-ray crystal-based Volume Free Electron Laser (XVFEL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical parameters of electron bunches available now in undulator X-ray FELs enable generation of induced radiation in crystal-based X-ray VFEL. An important peculiarity of an undulator X-ray FEL is electron bunch spatial modulation with the period equal to the wavelength of the produced radiation. Therefore, XFEL can be considered as a modulator of electron bunch density. As a result a facility combining an undulator, which produced a modulated beam, and a crystal, on which the modulated beam is incident, can be considered to be similar to klystron, which is a well-known source for microwaves emission. Use of pre-modulated beams enables to generate and observe superradiation and induced radiation in a crystal-based X-ray VFEL.</description>
