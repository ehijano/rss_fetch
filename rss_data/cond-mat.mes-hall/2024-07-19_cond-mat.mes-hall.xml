      <title>Quantum-vacuum-induced topological edge polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are induced by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-induced edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of spinful fermionic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the fermionic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (fermionic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-induced edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst effect based near field imaging of magnetic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) gives rise to an electrical response transverse to the magnetization and an applied temperature gradient in a magnetic metal. A nanoscale temperature gradient can be generated by the use of a laser beam applied to the apex of an atomic force microscope tip, thereby allowing for spatially-resolved ANE measurements beyond the optical diffraction limit. Such a method has been used previously to map in-plane magnetized magnetic textures. However, the spatial distribution of the out-of-plane temperature gradient, which is needed to fully interpret such an ANE-based imaging, was not studied. We therefore use a well-known magnetic texture, a magnetic vortex core, to demonstrate the reliability of the ANE method for the imaging of magnetic domains with nanoscale resolution. Moreover, since the ANE signal is directly proportional to the temperature gradient, we can also consider the inverse problem and deduce information about the nanoscale temperature distribution. Our results together with finite element modeling indicate that besides the out-of-plane temperature gradients, there are even larger in-plane temperature gradients. Thus we extend the ANE imaging to study out-of-plane magnetization in a racetrack nano-wire by detecting the ANE signal generated by in-plane temperature gradients. In all cases, a spatial resolution of about 80 nm is obtained. These results are significant for the rapidly growing field of thermo-electric imaging of antiferromagnetic spintronic device structures.</description>

      <title>A universal mechanism for optically addressable solid-state spin pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) has been observed from emitters in hexagonal boron nitride across a broad range of wavelengths, but so far an understanding of their microscopic structure and the physical origin of ODMR has been lacking. Here we perform comprehensive measurements and modelling of the spin-resolved photodynamics of ensembles and single emitters, and uncover a universal model that accounts, and provides an intuitive physical explanation, for all key experimental features. The model assumes a pair of nearby point defects -- a primary optically active defect and a secondary defect. Charge transfer between the two defects creates a metastable weakly coupled spin pair with ODMR naturally arising from selection rules. Our optical-spin defect pair (OSDP) model resolves several previously open questions including the asymmetric envelope of the Rabi oscillations, the large variability in ODMR contrast amplitude and sign, and the wide spread in emission wavelength. It may also explain similar phenomena observed in other wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN. The presented framework will be instrumental in guiding future theoretical and experimental efforts to study and engineer solid-state spin pairs and unlock their potential for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Probing spin textures in atomically thin CrSBr through tunneling magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of spin configurations and magnetoresistance in van der Waals magnetic semiconductors, particularly in the realm of thin-layer structures, holds paramount significance for the development of two-dimensional spintronic nanodevices. In this Letter, we conducted comprehensive magnetotransport measurements on a few-layer CrSBr using a vertical tunneling device configuration. Notably, our investigation revealed that tunneling magnetoresistance possesses a distinctive capability to discern spin configurations that would otherwise remain indistinguishable through alternative techniques such as photoluminescence. We observed the existence of energy-degenerate states exhibiting identical net magnetization and comparable spin configurations, which could be differentiated based on their rectification properties, reminiscent of a diode-like behavior at positive and negative bias voltages. Specifically, in devices comprising 5-layer CrSBr, we observed an intriguing positive magnetoresistive state when subjected to an in-plane magnetic field along the $b$-axis. To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms, we developed a one-dimensional linear chain model that successfully computed the magnetic state, thereby elucidating the underlying spin configurations responsible for the observed transport phenomena. These findings not only provide novel perspectives into the intricate spin textures of two-dimensional CrSBr but also underscore the sensitivity of tunneling as a probing technique for investigating the magnetic order in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization of Landau levels driven by residual strain in the ZrSiS surface band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multi-valley electronic band structure, lifting of the valley degeneracy is associated with rotational symmetry breaking in the electronic fluid, and may emerge through spontaneous symmetry breaking order, or through a large response to a small external perturbation such as strain. In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sub-levels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley's Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to obtain each valley's dispersion curve and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample-dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of $ \lt 0.025 \% $. The extreme valley-polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as $ \sim 0.1 \% $ strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Optical control of multiple resistance levels in graphene for memristic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has emphasized the need for memristors with non-volatile, multiple conductance levels. This paper demonstrates the potential of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures to act as memristors with multiple resistance states that can be optically tuned using visible light. The number of resistance levels in graphene can be controlled by modulating doping levels, achieved by varying the electric field strength or adjusting the duration of optical illumination. Our measurements show that this photodoping of graphene results from the optical excitation of charge carriers from the nitrogen-vacancy levels of hBN to its conduction band, with these carriers then being transferred to graphene by the gate-induced electric field. We develop a quantitative model to describe our observations. Additionally, utilizing our device architecture, we propose a memristive crossbar array for vector-matrix multiplications.</description>

      <title>Measuring Phonon Dispersion and Electron-Phason Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Graphene with a Cryogenic Quantum Twisting Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between electrons and phonons is one of the fundamental interactions in solids, underpinning a wide range of phenomena such as resistivity, heat conductivity, and superconductivity. However, direct measurements of this coupling for individual phonon modes remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for mapping phonon dispersions and electron phonon coupling (EPC) in van der Waals materials. By generalizing the quantum twisting microscope to cryogenic temperatures, we demonstrate its capability to map not only electronic dispersions via elastic momentum-conserving tunnelling, but also phononic dispersions through inelastic momentum-conserving tunnelling. Crucially, the inelastic tunnelling strength provides a direct and quantitative measure of the momentum and mode resolved EPC. We use this technique to measure the phonon spectrum and EPC of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Surprisingly, we find that unlike standard acoustic phonons, whose coupling to electrons diminishes as their momentum goes to zero, TBG exhibits a low energy mode whose coupling increases with decreasing twist angle. We show that this unusual coupling arises from the modulation of the inter-layer tunnelling by a layer-antisymmetric 'phason' mode of the moir\'e system. The technique demonstrated here opens the way for probing a large variety of other neutral collective modes that couple to electronic tunnelling, including plasmons, magnons and spinons in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Ferromagnetic Phase in the Second Moir\'e Band of Twisted MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands and electron correlation in moir\'e lattices give rise to many exotic phases, including Mott insulators, superconductivity, and topological states. Within the first moir\'e band, integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been observed in twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2) at one hole doping and fractional doping per moir\'e unit cell, respectively. When the second moir\'e band is fully hole doped, quantum spin Hall insulator has also been reported in tMoTe2 at a certain twist angle. Exotic topological states together with ferromagnetic (FM) states in the high moir\'e band can potentially exist as well. In this study, we report the observation of a FM phase in the second moir\'e band in tMoTe2. The FM phase can be tuned by both the doping level and displacement field. At filling around 2.58 holes per moir\'e unit cell, the FM phase reaches a Curie temperature of 3.5 K. A large displacement field can suppress the FM phase, like the FM phase at the filling of -1. Our results demonstrate the realization of time-reversal symmetry-breaking states in the higher moir\'e bands in tMoTe2.</description>

      <title>Electrically Controlled Interfacial Charge Transfer Induced Excitons in MoSe2-WSe2 Lateral Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling excitons and their transport in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) heterostructures is central to advancing photonics and electronics on-chip integration. We investigate the controlled generation and manipulation of excitons and their complexes in monolayer (1L) MoSe2-WSe2 lateral heterostructure (LHS), directly grown via water-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Using a field-effect transistor design by incorporating a few-layer graphene back gate, single-layer graphene edge contact and encapsulation with few-layer hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve precise electrical tuning of exciton complexes and their transfer across 1D interfaces. At cryogenic temperatures (4 K), photoluminescence and photocurrent maps reveal the synergistic effect of local electric field and interface phenomena in the modulation of excitons, trions, and free carriers. We observe spatial variations in exciton and trion densities driven by exciton-trion conversion under electrical manipulation. The first-principle density functional theory calculation reveals significant band modification at the lateral interfaces and graphene-TMDs contact region. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of 2D TMDS LHS in hosting and manipulating quantum emitters, achieving precise control over narrow-band emissions through modulating carrier injection and electrical biasing. This work extends the boundary of the present understanding of excitonic behaviour within lateral heterojunctions, highlighting the potential for controlled exciton manipulation across 1D interfaces and paving the way for next-generation electro-optical quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Inducing topological flat bands in bilayer graphene with electric and magnetic superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently argued that Bernal stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) exposed to a 2D superlattice (SL) potential exhibits a variety of intriguing behaviors [Ghorashi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 196201 (2023)]. Chief among them is the appearance of flat Chern bands that are favorable to the appearance of fractional Chern insulator states. Here, we explore the application of spatially periodic out-of-plane orbital magnetic fields to the model of Ghorashi et al. to find additional means of inducing flat Chern bands. We focus on fields that vary on length scales much larger than the atomic spacing in BLG, generating what we refer to as magnetic SLs. The magnetic SLs we investigate either introduce no net magnetic flux to the SL unit cell, or a single quantum of flux. We find that magnetic SLs acting on their own can induce topological flat bands, but richer behavior, such as the appearance of flat and generic bands with high Chern numbers, can be observed when the magnetic SLs act in conjunction with commensurate electric SLs. Finally, we propose a method of generating unit-flux-quantum magnetic SLs along with concomitant electric SLs. The magnetic SL is generated by periodic arrays of flux vortices originating from type II superconductors, while the electric SL arises due to a magnetic SL-induced charge density on the surface of a magnetoelectric material. Tuning the vortex lattice and the magnetoelectric coupling permits control of both SLs, and we study their effects on the band structure of BLG.</description>

      <title>Topological insulators on fractal lattices: A general principle of construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal lattices, featuring the self-similarity symmetry, are often geometric descents of parent crystals, possessing all their discrete symmetries (such as rotations and reflections) except the translational ones. Here, we formulate three different general approaches to construct real space Hamiltonian on a fractal lattice starting from the Bloch Hamiltonian on the parent crystal, fostering for example strong and crystalline topological insulators resulting from the interplay between the nontrivial geometry of the underlying electronic wavefunctions and the crystal symmetries. As a demonstrative example, we consider a generalized square lattice Chern insulator model, and within the framework of all three methods we successfully showcase incarnations of strong and crystalline Chern insulators on the Sierpi\'nski carpet fractal lattices. The proposed theoretical framework thus lays a generic foundation to build a tower of topological phases on the landscape of fractal lattices.</description>

      <title>Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionc and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, providing a platform for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</description>

      <title>Topological Kondo semimetal and insulator in AB-stacked heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments reported the realization of a heavy Fermi liquid in AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. In this paper we show that the AB-stacked heterobilayer configuration is particularly suited to realize topological Kondo semimetal and topological Kondo insulator ground states at a doping of two holes per moir\'e unit cell. The small lattice mismatch between the MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers and the different bandwidths of their highest lying moir\'e valence bands means that, in the experimentally relevant range of hole dopings, the MoTe$_2$ layer is effectively a Mott insulator with only low-lying magnetic excitations Kondo-coupled to more itinerant electrons in the WSe$_2$. The crucial consequence of the AB-stacking configuration is that the interlayer tunnelling connects orbitals of opposite parity in the two layers, leading to a chiral Kondo coupling. We show that the chiral Kondo coupling favors a topological Kondo semimetal at filling $\nu=1+1$, with a non-quantized spin Hall conductance arising from edge modes, whose spectrum and overlap with bulk states we determine. We further show that a spatially random strain field that locally breaks the rotation symmetry can convert the Kondo semimetal to a narrow gap topological Kondo insulator featuring a quantized spin Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic-Enhanced Thermal Circular Dichroism for Chiral Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular Dichroism (CD) can distinguish the handedness of chiral molecules. However, it is typically very weak due to vanishing absorption at low molecular concentrations. Here, we suggest Thermal Circular Dichroism (TCD) for chiral detection, leveraging the temperature difference in the chiral sample when subjected to right and left-circularly polarized excitations. The TCD combines the enantiospecificity of circular dichroism with the higher sensitivity of thermal measurements, while introducing new opportunities in the thermal domain that can be synergistically combined with optical approaches. We propose a theoretical framework to understand the TCD of individual and arrays of resonators covered by chiral molecules. To enhance the weak TCD of chiral samples, we first use individual dielectric Mie resonators and identify chirality transfer and self-heating as the underlying mechanisms giving rise to the differential temperature. However, inherent limitations imposed by the materials and geometries of such resonators make it challenging to surpass a certain level in enhancements. To overcome this, we suggest nonlocal thermal and electromagnetic interactions in arrays. We predict that a combination of chirality transfer to Mie resonators, collective thermal effects, and optical lattice resonance could, in principle, offer more than 4 orders of magnitude enhancement in TCD. Our thermonanophotonic-based approach thus establishes key concepts for ultrasensitive chiral detection.</description>

      <title>Smart polymer solution and thermal conductivity: How important is an exact polymer conformation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat management in devices is a key to their efficiency and longevity. Here, thermal switches (TS) are of great importance because of their ability to transition between different thermal conductivity $\kappa$ states. While traditional TS are bulky and slow, recent experiments have suggested "smart" responsive (bio--inspired) polymers as their fast alternatives. One example is poly(N--isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) in water, where $\kappa$ drops suddenly around a temperature $T_{\ell} \simeq 305$ K when a PNIPAM undergoes a coil--to--globule transition. At a first glance, this may suggest that the change in polymer conformation has a direct influence on TS. However, it may be presumptuous to trivially "only" link conformations with TS, especially because many complex microscopic details control macroscopic conformational transition. Motivated by this, we study TS in "smart" polymers using generic simulations. As the test cases, we investigate two different modes of polymer collapse using external stimuli, i.e., changing $T$ and cosolvent mole fraction $x_{\rm c}$. Collapse upon increasing $T$ shows a direct correlation between the conformation and $\kappa$ switching, while no correlation is observed in the latter case. These results suggest that the (co--)solvent--monomer interactions play a greater important role than the exact conformation in dictating TS. While some results are compared with the available experiments, possible future directions are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Composable Generation Strategy Framework Enabled Bidirectional Design on Topological Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators show important properties, such as topological phase transitions and topological edge states. Although these properties and phenomena can be simulated by well-designed circuits, it is undoubtedly difficult to design such topological circuits due to the complex physical principles and calculations involved. Therefore, achieving a framework that can automatically to complete bidirectional design of topology circuits is very significant. Here, we propose an effective bidirectional collaborative design framework with strong task adaptability, which can automatically generate specific results according to our requirements. In the framework, a composable generation strategy is employed, which involves building a shared multimodal space by bridging alignment in the diffusion process. For simplicity, a series of two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuits are constructed with different structural parameters. The framework at first is applied to find the relationship between the structural information and topological features. Then, the correctness of the results through experimental measurements can be verified by the automatically generated circuit diagram following the manufacture of Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The framework is demonstrated by achieving good results in the reverse design of circuit structures and forward prediction of topological edge states, reaching an accuracy of 94%. Overall, our research demonstrates the enormous potential of the proposed bidirectional deep learning framework in complex tasks and provides insights for collaborative design tasks.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of terahertz phonons and magnons in disparate and spatially-separated material specimens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between light and matter in condensed matter excitations and electromagnetic resonators serves as a rich playground for fundamental research and lies at the core of photonic and quantum technologies. Herein, we present comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies of the photon-mediated hybridization of magnons and phonons in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate the intriguing concept of composite states formed by distinct electric and magnetic quasiparticles strongly coupled to the same optical cavity modes. Specifically, we explore magnons excited in a slab of an antiferromagnetic crystal and phonons excited in a distinct specimen of an insulating material. The crystal slabs form an optical cavity with Fabry-P\'erot oscillations in the THz range. We demonstrate hybridized phonon-magnon polariton modes and their tunability by adjusting the distance between the slabs, showing that hybridization persists even at separations up to several millimeters. The experimental results are interpreted using both classical and quantum electrodynamical models. The quantum description allows us to quantify the degree of hybridization that is linked to a topological behavior of the electric field phasor, in agreement with the classical electrodynamics expectations. Importantly, the presented results refer to temperature conditions and cavities of millimeter size, paving the way for engineering realistic, frequency-tunable THz devices through the hybridization of electric (phononics) and magnetic (spintronics) elementary excitations of matter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to probe a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) with Josephson Junction Switching Current Detector (JJSCD). The sensitivity for the shear can reach $h\simeq 10^{-19}$ realistically, $10^{-21}$ in the near future, $10^{-24}$ optimistically. If we utilize the enhancement factor from the ratio of the frequency, it is possible to reach further below the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. It will be interesting if we can access the region to discover a footprint of new physics.</description>

      <title>Surface roughening in nanoparticle catalysts</title>

Abstract: Supported metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts are vital for the sustainable production of chemicals, but their design and implementation are limited by the ability to identify and characterize their structures and atomic sites that are correlated with high catalytic activity. Identification of these ''active sites'' has relied heavily on extrapolation to supported NP systems from investigation of idealized surfaces, experimentally using single crystals or supported NPs which are always modelled computationally using slab or regular polyhedra models. However, the ability of these methods to predict catalytic activity remains qualitative at best, as the structure of metal NPs in reactive environments has only been speculated from indirect experimental observations, or otherwise remains wholly unknown. Here, by circumventing these limitations for highly accurate simulation methods, we provide direct atomistic insight into the dynamic restructuring of metal NPs by combining in situ spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations powered by a machine learned force field. We find that in reactive environments, NP surfaces evolve to a state with poorly defined atomic order, while the core of the NP may remain bulk-like. These insights prove that long-standing conceptual models based on idealized faceting for small metal NP systems are not representative of real systems under exposure to reactive environments. We show that the resultant structure can be elucidated by combining advanced spectroscopy and computational tools. This discovery exemplifies that to enable faithful quantitative predictions of catalyst function and stability, we must move beyond idealized-facet experimental and theoretical models and instead employ systems which include realistic surface structures that respond to relevant physical and chemical conditions.</description>

      <title>Isospin Pomeranchuk effect and finite temperature resistivity minimum in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral graphene multilayers, in contrast, magnetism -- manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from fully itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show that despite the absence of localized electronic orbitals on the scale of the interparticle separation, rhombohedral graphene bi- and trilayers show thermodynamic signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments. Specifically, while long range valley order vanishes at temperatures of a few Kelvin, thermodynamic characteristics of fluctuating moments, probed via both electronic compressibility[2-4] and exciton sensing measurements[8], survive to temperatures an order of magnitude higher. Measurements of the electronic entropy in this regime reveal a contribution of $\Delta S \approx 1k_B$/charge carrier, onsetting at the Curie temperature, while first order phase transitions show an isospin "Pomeranchuk effect" in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[9, 10]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[11]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two dimensional flat band systems and their possible relevance both to low-temperature ground states and high temperature transport anomalies.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Fractional Chern Insulators IV: Fluctuation-Driven Collapse of FCIs in Multi-Band Exact Diagonalization Calculations on Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) observed in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene/hexagonal boron nitride superlattices have a unique origin contrary to theoretical expectations: their non-interacting band structure is gapless, unlike standard FCIs and the Landau level. Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations at filling $\nu=1$ yield a gapped ground state with Chern number 1 through band mixing, identifying a possible parent state. However, many-body calculations restricted to the occupied HF band predispose the system towards FCIs and are essentially uncontrolled. In this work, we use unbiased multi-band exact diagonalization (ED) to allow fluctuations into the gapless bands for two normal-ordering schemes. In the "charge neutrality" scheme, the weak moir\'e potential leads to theoretical proposals based on Wigner crystal-like states. However, we find that FCIs seen in 1-band ED calculations are destroyed by band mixing, becoming gapless as fluctuations are included. In the "average" scheme, the Coulomb interaction with the periodic valence charge background sets up a stronger moir\'e potential. On small systems, FCIs at $\nu=1/3$ are destroyed in multi-band calculations, while those at $\nu=2/3$ are initially strengthened. However we do not converge to a stable FCI at $\nu=2/3$ even on the largest accessible systems. These findings question prior results obtained within projection to a single HF band. They suggest that current models do not support FCIs with correlation length small enough to be converged in accessible, unbiased ED calculations, or do not support FCIs at all.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and solvability</title>

Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of the normal state quantum geometry on the superconducting phase in (111) oriented oxide interfaces and discuss some of the implications for the $\text{LaAlO}_3/\text{SrTiO}_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure. From a tight-binding modeling of the interface, we derive a two-band low-energy model, allowing us to analytically compute the quantum geometry and giving us access to the superfluid weight, as well as to showcase the role of two particular relevant energy scales. One is given by the trigonal crystal field which stems from the local trigonal symmetry at the interface, and the other one is due to orbital mixing at the interface. Our calculations indicate that the variation of the superfluid weight with the chemical potential $\mu$ is controlled by the quantum geometry in the low-$\mu$ limit where it presents a dome. At higher values of $\mu$ the conventional contribution dominates. In order to make quantitative comparisons between our results and experimental findings, we rely on an experimentally observed global reduction of the superfluid weight that we apply to both the conventional and geometric contributions. Furthermore, an experimentally measured non-monotonic variation of $\mu$ with the gate voltage $V_g$ is taken into account and yields a two-dome scenario for the superconducting critical temperature as a function of $V_g$. The observed dome in the low-$V_g$ regime is explained by the non-monotonic evolution of a dominant conventional part of the superfluid density. In contrast, the expected second dome at larger values of $V_g$ limit would be due to a dominant quantum-geometric contribution.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>

Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: The Hofstadter model allows to describe and understand several phenomena in condensed matter such as the quantum Hall effect, Anderson localization, charge pumping, and flat-bands in quasiperiodic structures, and is a rare example of fractality in the quantum world. An apparently unrelated system, the relativistic Toda lattice, has been extensively studied in the context of complex nonlinear dynamics, and more recently for its connection to supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and topological string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-energy physics. Here we discuss a recently discovered spectral relationship between the Hofstadter model and the relativistic Toda lattice which has been later conjectured to be related to the Langlands duality of quantum groups. Moreover, by employing similarity transformations compatible with the quantum group structure, we establish a formula parametrizing the energy spectrum of the Hofstadter model in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials. The main tools used are the spectral duality of tridiagonal matrices and the representation theory of the elementary quantum group.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is a key challenge for the development of practical quantum computers, a direction in which significant experimental progress has been made in recent years. In solid-state qubits, one of the leading information loss mechanisms is dephasing, usually modelled by phase flip errors. Here, we introduce quasistatic phase damping, a more subtle error model which describes the effect of Larmor frequency fluctuations due to 1/f noise. We show how this model is different from a simple phase flip error model, in terms of multi-cycle error correction. Considering the surface code, we provide numerical evidence for an error threshold, in the presence of quasistatic phase damping and readout errors. We discuss the implications of our results for spin qubits and superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: We compare critical quantum sensing to passive quantum strategies to perform frequency estimation, in the case of single-mode quadratic Hamiltonians. We show that, while in the unitary case both strategies achieve precision scaling quadratic with the number of photons, in the presence of dissipation this is true only for critical strategies. We also establish that working at the exceptional point or beyond threshold provides sub-optimal performance. This critical enhancement is due to the emergence of a transient regime in the open critical dynamics, and is invariant to temperature changes. When considering both time and system size as resources, for both strategies the precision scales linearly with the product of the total time and the number of photons, in accordance with fundamental bounds. However, we show that critical protocols outperform optimal passive strategies if preparation and measurement times are not negligible. Our results are applicable to a broad variety of critical sensors whose phenomenology can be reduced to that of a single-mode quadratic Hamiltonian, including systems described by finite-component and fully-connected models.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhancement of the superconducting spin-valve effect via strain-transfer across a ferromagnetic/ferroelectric interface</title>

Abstract: In a ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet (F/S/F) superconducting spin-valve (SSV), a change of the magnetization alignment of the two F layers modulates the critical temperature (Tc) of the S layer. The Tc-switching (the SSV effect) is based on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. Fast and large resistive switching associated with the Tc-switching is suitable for nonvolatile cryogenic memory applications. However, external magnetic field-based operation of SSVs is hindering their miniaturization, and therefore, electric field control of the SSV effect is desired. Here, we report epitaxial growth of a La0.67Ca0.33MnO3/YBa2Cu3O7/La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 SSV on a piezo-electric [Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3]0.7-[PbTiO3]0.3 (001) substrate and demonstrate electric field control of the SSV effect. Electric field-induced strain-transfer from the piezo-electric substrate increases the magnetization and Tc of the SSV, and leads to an enhancement of the magnitude of Tc-switching. The results are promising for the development of magnetic-field-free superconducting spintronic devices, in which the S/F interaction is not only sensitive to the magnetization alignment but also to an applied electric field.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric AlBN Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>

Abstract: We report the properties of molecular beam epitaxy deposited AlBN thin films on a recently developed epitaxial nitride metal electrode Nb2N. While a control AlN thin film exhibits standard capacitive behavior, distinct ferroelectric switching is observed in the AlBN films with increasing Boron mole fraction. The measured remnant polarization Pr of 15 uC/cm2 and coercive field Ec of 1.45 MV/cm in these films are smaller than those recently reported on films deposited by sputtering, due to incomplete wake-up, limited by current leakage. Because AlBN preserves the ultrawide energy bandgap of AlN compared to other nitride hi-K dielectrics and ferroelectrics, and it can be epitaxially integrated with GaN and AlN semiconductors, its development will enable several opportunities for unique electronic, photonic, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>

Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Direct Nanopatterning of Complex 3D Surfaces and Self-Aligned Superlattices via Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12420</link>

Abstract: Conventional lithography methods involving pattern transfer through resist templating face challenges of material compatibility with various process solvents. Other approaches of direct material writing often compromise pattern complexity and overlay accuracy. Here we explore a concept based on the moir\'e interference of molecular beams to directly pattern complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces made by any evaporable materials, such as metals, oxides and organic semiconductors. Our proposed approach, termed the Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography (MBHL), relies on precise control over angular projections of material flux passing through nanoapertures superimposed on the substrate, emulating the interference of coherent laser beams in interference lithography. Incorporating with our computational lithography (CL) algorithm, we have demonstrated self-aligned overlay of multiple material patterns to yield binary up to quinary superlattices, with a critical dimension and overlay accuracy on the order of 50 and 2 nanometers, respectively. The process is expected to substantially expand the boundary of materials combination for high-throughput fabrication of complex superstructures of translational symmetry on arbitrary substrates, enabling new nanoimaging, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>
