      <title>A Multi-Body Dobrushin-Sokal Criterion -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a sufficient condition for zero-freeness of partition functions applicable to lattice gases with possibly complex-valued multi-body interactions. This includes the case of hard-core interactions and, in particular, generalises recent results by Galvin et al.\ (2024) and Bencs-Buys (2025) on zero-free polydiscs of hypergraph independence polynomials. We provide two proofs: the first generalises the inductive approach of Bencs and Buys; the second employs the Kirkwood-Salsburg hierarchy. Notably, the central argument of the second proof uses of a certain partition scheme for coverings and, as a by-product, we obtain a direct improvement of Gallavotti and Miracle-Sol\'e's (1968) bounds for the Kirkwood-Salsburg operator.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Long-Range Order in a Lattice Fermion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a lattice fermion model with antiferromagnetic interactions on the three-dimensional cubic lattice. The hopping term of the Hamiltonian has a Weyl-type dispersion. We prove that the model has reflection positivity. Moreover, by relying on the property, we prove the existence of the antiferromagnetic long-range order at low temperatures in a strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Generalized Clapeyron's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clapeyron's Theorem in classical linear elasticity provides a way to explicitly express the energy stored in an equilibrium configuration in terms of the work of the forces applied on the boundary. We derive several new integral relations which can be viewed as nonlinear analogs of this classical result, reinterpreting them as rather general statements within Calculus of Variations. In the framework of nonlinear elasticity these relations reflect various partial symmetries of the material response, for instance, scale-invariance or scaling homogeneity. In particular, when the energy functional is scale-free, the obtained result can be interpreted as the Generalized Clapeyron's Theorem (GCT). Remarkably, it combines rather naturally the work of physical and configurational forces. We present a series of illuminating case studies showing the variety of applications of various obtained relations in different seemingly unrelated problems of mechanics.</description>

      <title>Complex rational Ruijsenaars model. The two-particle case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a complex rational degeneration of the hyperbolic Ruijsenaars model emerging in the limit $\omega_1+\omega_2\to 0$ (or $b\to \imath$ in $2d$ CFT) and investigate in detail the two-particle case. Corresponding wave functions are described by complex hypergeometric functions in the Mellin-Barnes representation. The dual integral representation and reflection symmetry in the coupling constant are established. Besides, a complex limit of the hyperbolic Baxter $Q$-operators is considered. Another complex degeneration of the hyperbolic Ruijsenaars model is obtained by taking a special $\omega_1-\omega_2\to 0$ (or $b\to 1$) limit. Additionally, two new degenerations to the complex Calogero-Sutherland type models are described.</description>

      <title>On algebraic structures underlying the rational Kashiwara-Miwa-type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rational Kashiwara-Miwa model is an example of an Ising-type integrable model of the statistical physics, related to the six-vertex trigonometric $R$-matrix. Two-spin edge weights of the model are expressed in the terms of $q$-products, its spins are arbitrary integers, and $|q|&lt;1$. We discuss in this paper the algebraic structures underlying the model, in particular its relation to the $q$-oscillator algebra, to representations of the $q$-oscillator algebra and to the co-product of the $q$-oscillator algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a method of construction of a double layer-to-layer auxiliary transfer matrix defined on a half-plane with a boundary. The transfer matrix obtained has the following features:
  - It produces a complete set of integrals of motion,
  - Its ingredients can be seen as an auxiliary problem for $3d$ Kuniba-Okado reflection matrix,
  - The model obtained has no quantum group interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical dynamical $r$-matrix structure for the periodic elliptic Ruijsenaars chain is described. The Poisson brackets for the monodromy matrix are calculated as well, thus providing Liouville integrability of the model. Next, we study its continuous non-relativistic limit and reproduce the Maillet type non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure for the field analogue of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model.</description>

      <title>Real-Analyticity of the Density of States for Random Schr\"odinger operators with Point Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove real-analyticity of the density of states (DOS) for random Schr\"odinger operators with lattice-supported point interactions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2,3$) in the small-hopping regime. In the attractive case, Krein's resolvent formula reduces the problem to a lattice model, where a random-walk expansion and disorder averaging lead to single-site integrals with holomorphic single-site density $g$. Contour deformation in the coupling-constant plane under a uniform pole-gap condition ensures convergence of the averaged resolvent in a complex neighborhood of a negative-energy interval. This yields analyticity of the DOS. The method also applies to multi-point correlation functions, such as those in the Kubo--Greenwood formula.</description>

      <title>On localization for the alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Anderson localization near the spectral edge for some alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with exponential long-range hopping. This extends the work of Bourgain [Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, LNM 1850: 77--99, 2004], in which he pioneered a novel multi-scale analysis to treat Bernoulli random variables. Our proof is mainly based on Bourgain's method. However, to establish the initial scales Green's function estimates, we adapt the approach of Klopp [Comm. Math. Phys, Vol. 232, 125--155, 2002], which is based on the Floquet-Bloch theory and a certain quantitative uncertainty principle. Our proof also applies to an analogues model on $\mathbb{R}^d.$</description>

      <title>On the N-elliptic localized solutions to the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and their asymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We parameterize the elliptic function solutions to the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation with four independent parameters and generate two equivalent forms of N-elliptic localized solutions to the DNLS equation through the Darboux-B\"acklund transformation. The N-elliptic localized solutions are expressed as (the derivative of) the ratios of determinants with entries in terms of Weierstrass sigma functions. Moreover, the asymptotic behaviors of both forms of N-elliptic localized solutions are analyzed along and between the propagation directions as $t \rightarrow \pm\infty$, which verify that the collisions between elliptic-solutions are elastic. We prove that the solution tends to a simple elliptic localized solution along each propagation direction. Between the propagation directions, the solution asymptotically approaches a shifted background. Furthermore, we establish sufficient conditions for strictly elastic collisions. The dynamic behaviors of the solutions are systematically investigated, with analytical results visualized through graphical illustrations. The asymptotic analysis of these solutions confirms that they exhibit the behavior predicted by the generalized soliton resolution conjecture on the elliptic function background.</description>

      <title>Spectral fluctuations and crossovers in multilayer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spectral fluctuations in multilayer networks within the random matrix theory (RMT) framework to characterize universal and non-universal features. The adjacency matrix of a multilayer network exhibits a block structure, with diagonal blocks representing intra-layer connections and off-diagonal blocks encoding inter-layer connections. Applying appropriate scaling factors for these blocks, we equalize variances across inter- and intra-layers, enabling direct comparison of spectral statistics. We analyze eigenvalue spectra across multilayer network configurations with varying inter- and intra-layer connectivities. Introducing a crossover model for bilayer networks, we capture the smooth transition of spectral properties from block-diagonal (two independent GOEs) to single-layer (one GOE) statistics as the relative strength of inter-layer to intra-layer connection varies. Furthermore, we analyze interatomic distance networks derived from protein crystal structures, including 1EWT, 1EWK, and 1UW6, to demonstrate applicability. Our findings reveal that the universality of spectral fluctuations persists across multilayer network architectures and highlight RMT as a robust tool for probing topological and dynamical complexities of real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Transforming antiunitary symmetries to a normal form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at explicit ways to bring one or two antiunitary symmetries into a standard form via unitary conjugation. We use the method Wigner introduced to prove that all antiunitary operators are direct sums of small antiunitary rotations. The methods are constructive and can be used to compute the needed unitaries in small examples. When we have two symmetries we can adapt these methods and still get a unitary to conjugate over to where the two symmetries are in a standard form. We cover all eight of the symmetry classes, the ones that involve at least one antiunitary symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Kac system interacting with two heat reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system formed by $M$ particles moving in 3 dimension and interacting with 2 heat reservoirs with $N&gt;&gt;M$ particles each. The system and the reservoirs evolve and interact via random collision described by a Kac-type master equation. The initial state of the reservoirs is given by 2 Maxwellian distributions at temperature $T_+$ and $T_-$. We show that, for times much shorter than $\sqrt{N}$ the interaction with the reservoirs is well approximated by the interaction with 2 Maxwellian thermostats, that is, heat reservoirs with $N=\infty$. As a byproduct, if $T_+=T_-$ we extend the results in \cite{BLTV} to particles in 3 dimension.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Analogue of the Pfaffian-Determinant Identity, An Algebraic and Geometric Study in the q-Skew-Symmetric Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a quantum deformation of the classical identity Pf(A)^2 = det(A) for 2n by 2n skew-symmetric matrices A, which classically relates the square of the Pfaffian to the determinant. In the quantum setting, we study matrices whose entries lie in a noncommutative algebra and satisfy the q-skew-symmetry relations a_ji = -q times a_ij and a_ii = 0, where q is a nonzero complex parameter. This deformation introduces new algebraic structures and challenges in defining quantum analogues of classical invariants.
  We construct the quantum Pfaffian Pf_q(A) and quantum determinant det_q(A) using two main approaches: the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan (FRT) construction and quantum exterior algebras. We provide precise definitions, derive algebraic identities, and analyze properties of these quantum objects. Special attention is given to verifying the quantum analogue of the Pfaffian-determinant identity, q to the power c times Pf_q(A)^2 = det_q(A), in low-dimensional cases such as 2n = 4, using explicit symbolic computations.
  We also explore geometric interpretations within the context of braided vector spaces, quantum symplectic geometry, and deformations of volume forms. The paper includes examples and diagrams highlighting connections between combinatorics, representation theory, and noncommutative geometry. Potential applications are discussed in quantum invariant theory, low-dimensional topology, and categorified geometry. These results contribute to the broader understanding of quantum analogues of classical linear algebra and their role in quantum group theory.</description>

      <title>Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.</description>

      <title>Line Operators in 3d Holomorphic QFT: Meromorphic Tensor Categories and dg-Shifted Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study line operators and their OPE's in perturbative 3d holomorphic-topological QFT's, including holomorphic-topological twists (quarter-BPS sectors) of 3d $N=2$ theories. In particular, we develop the representation theory of the category $C$ of perturbative line operators and its chiral tensor product, by generalizing techniques introduced by Costello and collaborators. We argue that lines are equivalent to modules for an $A_\infty$ algebra $A^!$ that's Koszul-dual to bulk local operators. We further establish a non-renormalization theorem for the OPE's of lines in a large class of theories (dubbed quasi-linear), allowing an exact resummation of quantum corrections. Based on physics arguments, we propose axioms for the full algebraic structure on $A^!$, calling it a "dg-shifted Yangian," which controls the OPE of lines. A key part of the structure is a Maurer-Cartan element $r(z)\in A^!\otimes A^!(\!(z^{-1})\!)$ that satisfies an $A_\infty$ generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation. As examples, we consider 3d $N=2$ gauge theories with arbitrary Chern-Simons levels, linear matter, and superpotential, and explicitly compute 1) perturbative bulk local operators (as $A_\infty$-chiral algebras); and 2) the Koszul-duals $A^!$ (proving they are dg-shifted Yangians).</description>

      <title>Ideal Fermi gas in the Dunkl formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas within the framework of the Dunkl formalism, which incorporates deformation effects through reflection symmetric differential operators. The formalism is applied to reformulate the creation and annihilation operators, leading to modified expressions for the fundamental thermodynamic quantities while preserving the underlying Fermi Dirac statistics. We derived modified expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities. In both the non degenerate and degenerate limits, we examined the effects of the Dunkl parameter on the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli paramagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct type $g\ell(n)$ Yangian algebra evaluations of order $N$ embedded in Heisenberg algebras and consider their representations having a highest weight. These Yangian algebra presentations depend on $nN$ parameters. We construct explicitly intertwiners, which exist if the parameter arrays are related by permutations. The intertwiners are products of elementary adjacent parameter permutation operators derived from $R$ operators obeying Yang-Baxter relations. Permutation coefficients appear in the action on representations. Their dependence on the parameters allows to distinguish the types of representations.</description>

Abstract: In this short note we give two examples of using the algebro-geometric theory of Painlev\'e equations to solve the Painlev\'e identification problem. The equations that we consider were recently obtained by M. van der Put and J. Top in their study of a certain ansatz of isomonodromic deformations of linear ODEs. We provide explicit coordinate transformations identifying these examples with standard form of some Painlev\'e equations and also explicitly identify their Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Almost Ricci Solitons on Class $\mathcal A$ Hypersurfaces of Product Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hypersurfaces in the product spaces $\mathbb{Q}_{\epsilon}^3 \times \mathbb{R}$ for which the tangential component $T$ of the vector field $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is a principal direction, where $\mathbb{Q}_{\epsilon}^3$ denotes the three-dimensional non-flat Riemannian space form with sectional curvature $\epsilon = \pm 1$, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is the unit vector field tangent to the $\mathbb{R}$-factor. We obtain a local classification of hypersurfaces with three distinct principal curvatures satisfying specific functional relations. Then, we determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for such hypersurfaces to admit an almost Ricci soliton structure with potential vector field $T$. Finally, we prove that the only hypersurfaces admitting such solitons are rotational, by showing that the constructed examples with three distinct principal curvatures do not admit almost Ricci solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant 3-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that, by an appropriate choice of the reference vector, both the equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 3-vertices can be extracted from the same integrand. We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character. We then discuss its connection with the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

Abstract: We present a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 4-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that the PT 4-vertex can be obtained from the same integrand as the Donaldson--Thomas (DT) 4-vertex by choosing a different reference vector. We illustrate the formalism through examples involving curves and surfaces on the 4-fold. Furthermore, we investigate the DT/PT correspondence for the 4-fold setting together with its higher rank and supergroup-like generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A one-parameter family of nonlinear (quartic) Klein-Gordon models having a sphaleron solution is studied. The sphaleron arises from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy functional. Its instability is shown be governed by a Heun differential equation after a change of variable. This allows an explicit formulation of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to be obtained in terms of local Heun functions. Good approximations are found for certain ranges of the parameter.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Spacetime Singularities I: Mathematical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive and rigorous overview of spacetime singularities within the framework of classical General Relativity. Singularities are defined through the failure of geodesic completeness, reflecting the limits of predictability in spacetime evolution. The paper reviews the mathematical structures involved, including differentiability classes of the metric, and explores key constructions such as Geroch's and Schmidt's formulations of singular boundaries. A detailed classification of singularities - quasi-regular, non-scalar, and scalar - is proposed, based on the behavior of curvature tensors along incomplete curves. The limitations of previous approaches, including the cosmic censorship conjecture and extensions beyond General Relativity, are critically examined. The work also surveys the major singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking, emphasizing their implications for gravitational collapse and cosmology. By focusing exclusively on the classical regime, the article lays a solid foundation for the systematic study of singular structures in relativistic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Chapman-Enskog Divergence Problem in Plasma Transport: Structural Limitations and a Practical Regularization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate transport coefficients from the Chapman--Enskog expansion with BGK collision operators, obtaining exactly $\kappa = \frac{5nT}{2m\nu}$, and show that maximum entropy closure yields identical results when applied with the same collision operator. Through structural arguments, we suggest that this $1/\nu$ divergence extends to other local collision operators of the form $\mathcal{L} = \nu\hat{L}$, making the divergence fundamental to the Chapman--Enskog approach rather than a closure artifact. To address this limitation, we propose a phenomenological effective collision frequency $\nu_{\eff} = \nu\sqrt{1 + \Kn^2}$ motivated by gradient-driven decorrelation, where $\Kn$ is the Knudsen number. We verify that this regularization maintains conservation laws and thermodynamic consistency while yielding finite transport coefficients across all collisionality regimes. Comparison with exact solutions of a bounded kinetic model shows similar functional form, providing limited validation of our approach. This work provides explicit calculation of a known divergence problem in kinetic theory and offers one phenomenological regularization method with transparent treatment of mathematical assumptions versus physical approximations.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Type Operator Deformed by Generalized Fibonacci Numbers and Its Combinatorial Moment Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter deformation of the classical Poisson distribution from the viewpoint of noncommutative probability theory, by defining a $(q,t)$-Poisson type operator (random variable) on the $(q,t)$-Fock space \cite{Bl12} (See also \cite{BY06, AY20}). From the analogous viewpoint of the classical Poisson limit theorem in probability theory, we are naturally led to a family of orthogonal polynomials, which we call the $(q,t)$-Charlier polynomials. These generalize the $q$-Charlier polynomials of Saitoh-Yoshida \cite{SY00a, SY00b} and reflect deeper combinatorial symmetries through the additional deformation parameter $t$. A central feature of this paper is the derivation of a combinatorial moment formula of the $(q,t)$-Poisson type operator and the $(q,t)$-Poisson distribution. This is accomplished by means of a card arrangement technique, which encodes set partitions together with crossing and nesting statistics. The resulting expression naturally exhibits a duality between these statistics, arising from a structure rooted in generalized Fibonacci numbers. Our approach provides a concrete framework where methods in combinatorics and theory of orthogonal polynomials are used to investigate the probabilistic properties arising from the $(q,t)$-deformation.</description>

      <title>Detecting $k$-nonstretchability via a class of informationally complete symmetric measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement characterization is a core problem in quantum information theory, with several classification schemes available. Among these, the $k$-stretchability, recently introduced [Szalay, Quantum 3, 204 (2019)], can be used to describe multipartite entanglement structure. Recently, a class of symmetric measurements (informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs) has been proposed [Siudzi$\textrm{\'{n}}$ska, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{105}, 042209 (2022)] , which includes GSIC-POVMs and MUMs. In this work, we discuss the detection of $k$-nonstretchability based on informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs and obtain some $k$-nonstretchability criteria for multipartite quantum systems. It is shown that these criteria can identify certain $k$-nonstretchable states, and their practical applicability and advantages are illustrated through specific examples.</description>

      <title>Form factors of composite branch-point twist operators in the sinh-Gordon model on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface: semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure.
  Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <title>Modified security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution with random key basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security analysis is a critical part in any cryptographic protocol, may it be classical or quantum. Without security analysis, one cannot ensure the secrecy of the distributed keys. To perform a conclusive security analysis, it is very often necessary to frame the problem as an optimization problem. However, solving such optimization problems is quite challenging. In this article, we focus on the security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) with random key basis protocol. We show that the optimization cost of the existing security analysis can be reduced without compromising the key rate. In particular, we reframe the entire security analysis of this protocol as a strongly convex optimization problem and demonstrate that unlike the original security proof, optimization of Bob's measurement angles for finding a lower bound on Eve's uncertainty about Alice's key generation basis can be done with lesser cost. We derive an explicit form of the pessimistic error that arises while optimizing the measurement angles of both the parties. We also clarify a few parts of the original security proof, making the analysis more rigorous and complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming non-orthogonal bases into orthogonal ones often sacrifices essential properties or physical meaning in quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate that L\"owdin symmetric orthogonalization (LSO) outperforms the widely used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) in characterizing and quantifying quantum resources, with particular emphasis on coherence and superposition. We employ LSO both to construct an orthogonal basis from a non-orthogonal one and to obtain a non-orthogonal basis from an orthogonal set, thereby avoiding any ambiguity related to the basis choice for quantum coherence. Unlike GSO, which depends on the ordering of input states, LSO applies a symmetric transformation that treats all vectors equally and minimizes deviation from the original basis. This approach generates basis sets with enhanced stability and physical relevance, facilitating the analysis of superpositions in non-orthogonal quantum states. Building on LSO, we also introduce L\"owdin weights -- probabilistic weights for non-orthogonal representations that provide a consistent measure of resource content. These weights further enable basis-independent quantification of coherence and state delocalization through information-theoretic measures such as entropy and participation ratios. Our theoretical and numerical analyses confirm LSO's superior preservation of quantum state symmetry and resource characteristics, underscoring the critical role of orthogonalization methods and L\"owdin weights in resource theory frameworks.</description>

      <title>Sheffer Polynomials and the s-ordering of Exponential Boson Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The s-ordered form of any product of single-mode boson creation and annihilation operators, containing only a single annihilator, is computed explicitly. The s-ordering concept originated in quantum optics, and subsumes normal, symmetric (Weyl), and anti-normal ordering for any two operators satisfying a canonical commutation relation. Because the s-ordering map can be viewed as producing a function of a complex variable, its inverse is a quantization map that takes such "classical" functions to quantum operators. The explicit s-ordered expressions are derived with the aid of a parametric family of Sheffer polynomial sequences (or equivalently an exponential Riordan array of polynomial coefficients), called the Hsu-Shiue family. To yield orderings interpolating between normal and anti-normal, this family is extended in an intricate way.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mastering Cosmological Amplitudes Using Generalized Ramanujan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for computing cosmological amplitudes, including in-in correlators and wavefunction coefficients, in FRW spacetime. Specializing to cases with conformally-coupled external scalars and massive scalar exchanges, we introduce a decomposition into massive family trees, which capture the nested time structure common to these observables. We then evaluate these building blocks using the Method of Brackets (MoB), a multivariate extension of Ramanujan's master theorem that operates directly on the integrand, translating integrals into discrete summations via a compact set of algebraic rules. This yields infinite series representations valid across the full space of external momenta and internal energies. We also develop Feynman-like diagrammatic rules that map interaction graphs to summand structures, enabling efficient and scalable computation. The resulting expressions make time evolution manifest, smoothly interpolate to the conformal limit, and are well suited for both numerical evaluation and analytic analysis of massive field effects in cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Revisiting the results by Winternitz [Symmetry in physics, CRM Proc. Lecture Notes 34, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004, pp. 215-227], we thoroughly refine his classification of Lie subalgebras of the real order-three special linear Lie algebra and thus present the correct version of this classification for the first time. A similar classification over the complex numbers is also carried out. We follow the general approach by Patera, Winternitz and Zassenhaus but in addition enhance it and rigorously prove its theoretical basis for the required specific cases of classifying subalgebras of real or complex finite-dimensional Lie algebras. As a byproduct, we first construct complete lists of inequivalent subalgebras of the rank-two affine Lie algebra over both the real and complex fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.</description>

Abstract: We construct a bijection between the state of the box-ball system with box capacity L and a pair of two sequences. In time evolution, one of the sequences moves at speed 1, and the other follows the rules of the box-ball system with box capacity one, which can be linearized by the Kerov-Kirillov-Reshetikhin(KKR) bijection. Our method can be applied to a state including a negative value or a value greater than the box capacity.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the quantum de Finetti theorem. We state and prove a couple of variants thereof. In parallel, we introduce an operator version of the Martin boundary on quantum groups and prove generalizations of Biane's theoresm. Our proof of the de Finetti theorem is new in the sense that it is based on an analogy with the theory of operator valued Martin boundary that we introduce.</description>

Abstract: Interference of randomly scattered classical waves naturally leads to familiar speckle patterns, where the wave intensity follows an exponential distribution while the wave field itself is described by a circularly symmetric complex normal distribution. In the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave beam propagation, we demonstrate how a deterministic incident beam transitions to such a fully developed speckle pattern over long distances in the so-called scintillation (weak-coupling) regime.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons, called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rules in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFT and categorical symmetry of the TO or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we present a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of many-body localized systems: logarithmic lightcones and $\log \, t$-law of $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional local spin systems, the XXZ model with random magnetic field is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \alpha$-R\'enyi entropies, with $ \alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

Abstract: Heckman-Polychronakos operators form a prominent family of commuting differential-difference operators defined in terms of the Dunkl operators $\mathcal D_i$ as $\mathcal P_m= \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i \mathcal D_i)^m$. They have been known since 1990s in connection with trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian and Jack symmetric polynomials. We explicitly compute the eigenvalues of these operators for symmetric and skew-symmetric eigenfunctions, as well as partial sums of eigenvalues for general polynomial eigenfunctions.</description>

Abstract: Conformal geodesics form an invariantly defined family of unparametrized curves in a conformal manifold generalizing unparametrized geodesics/paths of projective connections. The equation describing them is of third order, and it was an open problem whether they are given by an Euler--Lagrange equation. In dimension 3 (the simplest, but most important from the viewpoint of physical applications) we demonstrate that the equation for unparametrized conformal geodesics is variational.</description>

      <title>Fractal curvatures and short-time asymptotics of heat content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present new mathematical developments on the analysis of de Gennes' hypothesis on the short-time asymptotics of the heat content for bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fractal boundary. We conjecture that fractal curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with fractal boundary and the results discussed here are small initial contributions towards a resolution.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Nehari ground states for the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on Discrete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a discrete graph. We characterize for a self-adjoint realizations of Schr\"odinger operators conditions related with the geometry of the graph that guarantee discreteness of the spectrum and study ground states on the generalized Nehari manifold in order to prove the existence of standing wave solutions in the self-focusing and defocusing case. In this context, we show properties of the solutions, such as integrability. Finally, we discuss decay properties of solutions and the bifurcation of solutions from the trivial solution.</description>

      <title>A pedagogical approach to the black hole information problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semiclassical depiction of gravity has provided many important results, such as particle creation effects in expanding universes and in spacetimes containing black holes. However, many questions remain open, most notably concerning the final product of the black hole evaporation process and the conservation of information. From a pedagogical perspective, we review the concepts that lead to this state of affairs, also known as the black hole information problem, and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. Stating the necessary conjectures and results that lead to the geometrical properties of black holes, we present the notion of black hole evaporation and the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory under the Hadamard condition. We then show that, under certain assumptions, formation and complete evaporation of a black hole can lead to information loss. Comparing such a result to the main alternatives to this non-unitary dynamical evolution, we formulate the black hole information problem and show that information loss is a genuine prediction if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous quantization of the Yang-Mills gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a nonsingular loop-space calculus for the Yang-Mills (YM) gradient flow, in which all variations act within the manifold of smooth loops via ``dot derivatives'' that are finite, parametrization-invariant, and free of cusp or backtracking singularities. This yields an exact momentum-loop representation and a universal trilinear loop-space diffusion equation, valid for any non-Abelian gauge group. We identify two distinct classes of exact solutions. The first is a self-dual (Hodge-dual) matrix-valued minimal surface whose area functional, when exponentiated, solves the fixed-point loop equation exactly, without contact terms or ambiguities; for planar loops the dual area equals $2\sqrt{2}$ times the Euclidean minimal area, providing a geometrically grounded confinement mechanism. We also prove that the ordinary minimal surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$ fails to satisfy the fixed-point loop equation, due to a singular nonvanishing contribution from the loop operator. The second is a decaying-flow solution in which the momentum loop performs a periodic random walk on regular star polygons -- the ``Euler ensemble'' previously found in Navier-Stokes turbulence -- realizing a form of \emph{spontaneous quantization} in the YM gradient flow. We discuss the emergence of quantum-like Wilson-loop statistics from deterministic classical dynamics, potential implications for confinement in QCD, and the role of these fixed points as attractors in the space of YM gradient-flow trajectories.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure scalars constructed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor for the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ and $T$ are the Ricci scalar and the trace of energy-momentum tensor, respectively), and also the way these quantities influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. In absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is found to be influenced by the structure scalar $X_{TF}$ and the mass-function of the collapsing matter. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of the various physical parameters like heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy on the structure scalars, have been clearly indicated along with a discussion on the complexity factor of the collapsing configuration. The $f(R,T)$ junction conditions have been presented, showing the matching conditions for the matter Lagrangian and their derivatives at the boundary. The energy conditions are also presented and the possibility of violation of the Strong Energy Condition has been discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of Wind-Drift Currents at Mid-Latitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean at mid-latitudes, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Loss-Complexity Landscape and Model Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</description>

      <title>When quenched and annealed pinning transitions coincide? A directed walk near a corrugated wall in disorders of various types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a half-line $x \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) with distribution $Q(u_j)$, located at $x=0$. By computing the first two moments, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over different disorder distributions, we provide the explicit condition for coincidence/distinction of pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the transition points of annealed and quenched systems are always different, although for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this distinction may be hardly noticeable. This result may help reconcile opposing viewpoints on whether quenching is marginally relevant.</description>

      <title>A Novel On-Shell Recursive Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for deriving on-shell recursion relations, with a specific focus on biadjoint and pure Yang-Mills theories. Starting from the double-cover CHY factorization formulae, we identify a suitable set of independent kinematic variables that enables the reconstruction of amputated currents from amplitudes. As a byproduct, this new recursive structure recasts the BCJ numerators into an explicitly on-shell factorized form.</description>
