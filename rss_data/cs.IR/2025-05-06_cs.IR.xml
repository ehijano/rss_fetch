      <title>Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction in real-world recommender systems often deals with billions of user interactions every day. To improve the training efficiency, it is common to update the CTR prediction model incrementally using the new incremental data and a subset of historical data. However, the feature embeddings of a CTR prediction model often get stale when the corresponding features do not appear in current incremental data. In the next period, the model would have a performance degradation on samples containing stale features, which we call the feature staleness problem. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning method for CTR prediction (FeSAIL) which adaptively replays samples containing stale features. We first introduce a staleness aware sampling algorithm (SAS) to sample a fixed number of stale samples with high sampling efficiency. We then introduce a staleness aware regularization mechanism (SAR) for a fine-grained control of the feature embedding updating. We instantiate FeSAIL with a general deep learning-based CTR prediction model and the experimental results demonstrate FeSAIL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Direct Retrieval-augmented Optimization: Synergizing Knowledge Selection and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) integrates large language models ( LLM s) with retrievers to access external knowledge, improving the factuality of LLM generation in knowledge-grounded tasks. To optimize the RAG performance, most previous work independently fine-tunes the retriever to adapt to frozen LLM s or trains the LLMs to use documents retrieved by off-the-shelf retrievers, lacking end-to-end training supervision. Recent work addresses this limitation by jointly training these two components but relies on overly simplifying assumptions of document independence, which has been criticized for being far from real-world scenarios. Thus, effectively optimizing the overall RAG performance remains a critical challenge.
  We propose a direct retrieval-augmented optimization framework, named DRO, that enables end-to-end training of two key components: (i) a generative knowledge selection model and (ii) an LLM generator. DRO alternates between two phases: (i) document permutation estimation and (ii) re-weighted maximization, progressively improving RAG components through a variational approach. In the estimation step, we treat document permutation as a latent variable and directly estimate its distribution from the selection model by applying an importance sampling strategy. In the maximization step, we calibrate the optimization expectation using importance weights and jointly train the selection model and LLM generator. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DRO is analogous to policy-gradient methods in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets illustrate that DRO outperforms the best baseline with 5%-15% improvements in EM and F1. We also provide in-depth experiments to qualitatively analyze the stability, convergence, and variance of DRO.</description>

      <title>Characterising Topic Familiarity and Query Specificity Using Eye-Tracking Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye-tracking data has been shown to correlate with a user's knowledge level and query formulation behaviour. While previous work has focused primarily on eye gaze fixations for attention analysis, often requiring additional contextual information, our study investigates the memory-related cognitive dimension by relying solely on pupil dilation and gaze velocity to infer users' topic familiarity and query specificity without needing any contextual information. Using eye-tracking data collected via a lab user study (N=18), we achieved a Macro F1 score of 71.25% for predicting topic familiarity with a Gradient Boosting classifier, and a Macro F1 score of 60.54% with a k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier for query specificity. Furthermore, we developed a novel annotation guideline -- specifically tailored for question answering -- to manually classify queries as Specific or Non-specific. This study demonstrates the feasibility of eye-tracking to better understand topic familiarity and query specificity in search.</description>

      <title>Soft Reasoning Paths for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning paths are reliable information in knowledge graph completion (KGC) in which algorithms can find strong clues of the actual relation between entities. However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to guarantee that computationally affordable paths exist toward all candidate entities. According to our observation, the prediction accuracy drops significantly when paths are absent. To make the proposed algorithm more stable against the missing path circumstances, we introduce soft reasoning paths. Concretely, a specific learnable latent path embedding is concatenated to each relation to help better model the characteristics of the corresponding paths. The combination of the relation and the corresponding learnable embedding is termed a soft path in our paper. By aligning the soft paths with the reasoning paths, a learnable embedding is guided to learn a generalized path representation of the corresponding relation. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical ranking strategy to make full use of information about the entity, relation, path, and soft path to help improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the model. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms by a notable margin. The code will be made publicly available after the paper is officially accepted.</description>

      <title>Avoid Recommending Out-of-Domain Items: Constrained Generative Recommendation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative recommender systems due to their transformative capabilities in user interaction. However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

      <title>Tell Me the Good Stuff: User Preferences in Movie Recommendation Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems play a vital role in helping users discover content in streaming services, but their effectiveness depends on users understanding why items are recommended. In this study, explanations were based solely on item features rather than personalized data, simulating recommendation scenarios. We compared user perceptions of one-sided (purely positive) and two-sided (positive and negative) feature-based explanations for popular movie recommendations. Through an online study with 129 participants, we examined how explanation style affected perceived trust, transparency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. One-sided explanations consistently received higher ratings across all dimensions. Our findings suggest that in low-stakes entertainment domains such as popular movie recommendations, simpler positive explanations may be more effective. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounding factors such as item familiarity and the placement of negative information in explanations. This work provides practical insights for explanation design in recommender interfaces and highlights the importance of context in shaping user preferences.</description>

      <title>CB-cPIR: Code-Based Computational Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A private information retrieval (PIR) scheme is a protocol that allows a user to retrieve a file from a database without revealing the identity of the desired file to a curious database. Given a distributed data storage system, efficient PIR can be achieved by making assumptions about the colluding capabilities of the storage servers holding the database. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, privacy is lost. In this work, we focus on the worst-case assumption: full collusion or, equivalently, viewing the storage system virtually as a single honest-but-curious server. We present CB-cPIR, a single-server code-based computational private information retrieval (cPIR) scheme that derives security from code-based cryptography. Specifically, the queries are protected by the hardness of decoding a random linear code. The scheme is heavily inspired by the pioneering code-based cPIR scheme proposed by Holzbaur, Hollanti, and Wachter-Zeh in [Holzbaur et al., "Computational Code-Based Single-Server Private Information Retrieval", 2020 IEEE ISIT] and fixes the vulnerabilities of the original scheme arising from highly probable rank differences in submatrices of the user's query. For further validation, we draw comparisons to the state-of-the-art lattice-based cPIR schemes.</description>

      <title>Modeling Musical Genre Trajectories through Pathlet Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of user data on music streaming platforms opens up new possibilities for analyzing music consumption. However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems. A dataset of 2000 user histories tagged by genre over 17 months, supplied by Deezer (a leading music streaming company), is also released with the code.</description>

      <title>STAR-Rec: Making Peace with Length Variance and Pattern Diversity in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deep sequential recommendation models often struggle to effectively model key characteristics of user behaviors, particularly in handling sequence length variations and capturing diverse interaction patterns. We propose STAR-Rec, a novel architecture that synergistically combines preference-aware attention and state-space modeling through a sequence-level mixture-of-experts framework. STAR-Rec addresses these challenges by: (1) employing preference-aware attention to capture both inherently similar item relationships and diverse preferences, (2) utilizing state-space modeling to efficiently process variable-length sequences with linear complexity, and (3) incorporating a mixture-of-experts component that adaptively routes different behavioral patterns to specialized experts, handling both focused category-specific browsing and diverse category exploration patterns. We theoretically demonstrate how the state space model and attention mechanisms can be naturally unified in recommendation scenarios, where SSM captures temporal dynamics through state compression while attention models both similar and diverse item relationships. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods, particularly in scenarios involving diverse user behaviors and varying sequence lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WWW 2025 EReL@MIR Workshop Multimodal CTR Prediction Challenge focuses on effectively applying multimodal embedding features to improve click-through rate (CTR) prediction in recommender systems. This technical report presents our 1$^{st}$ place winning solution for Task 2, combining sequential modeling and feature interaction learning to effectively capture user-item interactions. For multimodal information integration, we simply append the frozen multimodal embeddings to each item embedding. Experiments on the challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior performance with a 0.9839 AUC on the leaderboard, much higher than the baseline model. Code and configuration are available in our GitHub repository and the checkpoint of our model can be found in HuggingFace.</description>

      <title>Familiarizing with Music: Discovery Patterns for Different Music Discovery Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans have the tendency to discover and explore. This natural tendency is reflected in data from streaming platforms as the amount of previously unknown content accessed by users. Additionally, in domains such as that of music streaming there is evidence that recommending novel content improves users' experience with the platform. Therefore, understanding users' discovery patterns, such as the amount to which and the way users access previously unknown content, is a topic of relevance for both the scientific community and the streaming industry, particularly the music one. Previous works studied how music consumption differs for users of different traits and looked at diversity, novelty, and consistency over time of users' music preferences. However, very little is known about how users discover and explore previously unknown music, and how this behavior differs for users of varying discovery needs. In this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing data from a survey answered by users of the major music streaming platform Deezer in combination with their streaming data. We first address questions regarding whether users who declare a higher interest in unfamiliar music listen to more diverse music, have more stable music preferences over time, and explore more music within a same time window, compared to those who declare a lower interest. We then investigate which type of music tracks users choose to listen to when they explore unfamiliar music, identifying clear patterns of popularity and genre representativeness that vary for users of different discovery needs.
  Our findings open up possibilities to infer users' interest in unfamiliar music from streaming data as well as possibilities to develop recommender systems that guide users in exploring music in a more natural way.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Inference for Eliminating Sentiment Bias in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for users. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.</description>

      <title>Rational Retrieval Acts: Leveraging Pragmatic Reasoning to Improve Sparse Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current sparse neural information retrieval (IR) methods, and to a lesser extent more traditional models such as BM25, do not take into account the document collection and the complex interplay between different term weights when representing a single document. In this paper, we show how the Rational Speech Acts (RSA), a linguistics framework used to minimize the number of features to be communicated when identifying an object in a set, can be adapted to the IR case -- and in particular to the high number of potential features (here, tokens). RSA dynamically modulates token-document interactions by considering the influence of other documents in the dataset, better contrasting document representations. Experiments show that incorporating RSA consistently improves multiple sparse retrieval models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets from the BEIR benchmark. https://github.com/arthur-75/Rational-Retrieval-Acts</description>

      <title>Iterative Resolution of Prompt Ambiguities Using a Progressive Cutting-Search Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.</description>

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of fatalities worldwide, often occurring suddenly with limited time for intervention. Current healthcare monitoring systems for cardiac patients rely heavily on hospitalization, which can be impractical for continuous monitoring. This paper presents a novel IoT-based solution for remote, real-time tracking of critical cardiac metrics, addressing the pressing need for accessible and continuous healthcare, particularly for the aging population in Pakistan. The proposed IoT kit measures essential parameters such as body temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SPO2), and electrocardiography (ECG).
  A key innovation of the system is its integration with a cloud-based application, enabling constant remote monitoring and incorporating an alarm mechanism to alert medical professionals for timely intervention, reducing the risk of catastrophic incidents. The system was tested in a clinical environment with 20 participants, demonstrating results closely aligned with those obtained using standard medical devices. The findings validate the system's potential for reliable remote monitoring, offering a significant step forward in proactive cardiac healthcare management. This novel approach combines IoT technology with cloud-based applications to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for reducing unexpected fatalities among cardiac patients.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure Representation Learning of Confounders in Latent Space for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.</description>

      <title>ir_explain: a Python Library of Explainable IR Methods</title>

Abstract: While recent advancements in Neural Ranking Models have resulted in significant improvements over traditional statistical retrieval models, it is generally acknowledged that the use of large neural architectures and the application of complex language models in Information Retrieval (IR) have reduced the transparency of retrieval methods. Consequently, Explainability and Interpretability have emerged as important research topics in IR. Several axiomatic and post-hoc explanation methods, as well as approaches that attempt to be interpretable-by-design, have been proposed. This article presents \irexplain, an open-source Python library that implements a variety of well-known techniques for Explainable IR (ExIR) within a common, extensible framework. \irexplain supports the three standard categories of post-hoc explanations, namely pointwise, pairwise, and listwise explanations. The library is designed to make it easy to reproduce state-of-the-art ExIR baselines on standard test collections, as well as to explore new approaches to explaining IR models and methods. To facilitate adoption, \irexplain is well-integrated with widely-used toolkits such as Pyserini and \irdatasets.</description>

      <title>Online Item Cold-Start Recommendation with Popularity-Aware Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of e-commerce and short videos, online recommender systems that can capture users' interests and update new items in real-time play an increasingly important role. In both online and offline recommendation systems, the cold-start problem caused by interaction sparsity has been impacting the effectiveness of recommendations for cold-start items. Many cold-start scheme based on fine-tuning or knowledge transferring shows excellent performance on offline recommendation. Yet, these schemes are infeasible for online recommendation on streaming data pipelines due to different training method, computational overhead and time constraints. Inspired by the above questions, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation algorithm called Popularity-Aware Meta-learning (PAM), to address the item cold-start problem under streaming data settings. PAM divides the incoming data into different meta-learning tasks by predefined item popularity thresholds. The model can distinguish and reweight behavior-related and content-related features in each task based on their different roles in different popularity levels, thus adapting to recommendations for cold-start samples. These task-fixing design significantly reduces additional computation and storage costs compared to offline methods. Furthermore, PAM also introduced data augmentation and an additional self-supervised loss specifically designed for low-popularity tasks, leveraging insights from high-popularity samples. This approach effectively mitigates the issue of inadequate supervision due to the scarcity of cold-start samples. Experimental results across multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods in addressing cold-start challenges in online streaming data scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLM4Tag: Automatic Tagging System for Information Retrieval via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tagging systems play an essential role in various information retrieval applications such as search engines and recommender systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in tagging systems due to their extensive world knowledge, semantic understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing methods still have limitations, including difficulties in retrieving relevant candidate tags comprehensively, challenges in adapting to emerging domain-specific knowledge, and the lack of reliable tag confidence quantification. To address these three limitations above, we propose an automatic tagging system LLM4Tag. First, a graph-based tag recall module is designed to effectively and comprehensively construct a small-scale highly relevant candidate tag set. Subsequently, a knowledge-enhanced tag generation module is employed to generate accurate tags with long-term and short-term knowledge injection. Finally, a tag confidence calibration module is introduced to generate reliable tag confidence scores. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets show that LLM4Tag significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and LLM4Tag has been deployed online for content tagging to serve hundreds of millions of users.</description>

      <title>CCSK:Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge Based Retrieval Augmentation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in Q&amp;A task increased substantially through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) which brings in external knowledge. However, the main difficulty lies in balancing the inherent self-knowledge of LLMs with external information retrieval (IR). The current threshold-based methods apply one-dimensional static mechanisms with single criterion. As a result, their IR decisions might be irrelevant to the LLMs' response under difficult queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge (CCSK). Different from traditional methods that maintain single fixed IR activation criteria, CCSK implements a dynamic joint decision process via a Siamese Network module and a Response Quality Model. The Siamese Network calculates the cosine similarity between the current query and the historical queries. The Response Quality Model evaluates the responses of LLMs through LightGBM. The final decision of the CCSK is derived from the outputs of the two modules, as well as text features fused using a multi-head attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CCSK significantly enhances the model's effectiveness in information retrieval.</description>

      <title>IRA: Adaptive Interest-aware Representation and Alignment for Personalized Multi-interest Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Granularity Retrieval Framework for Visually-Rich Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have predominantly focused on text-based retrieval, limiting their effectiveness in handling visually-rich documents that encompass text, images, tables, and charts. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified multi-granularity multimodal retrieval framework tailored for two benchmark tasks: MMDocIR and M2KR. Our approach integrates hierarchical encoding strategies, modality-aware retrieval mechanisms, and vision-language model (VLM)-based candidate filtering to effectively capture and utilize the complex interdependencies between textual and visual modalities. By leveraging off-the-shelf vision-language models and implementing a training-free hybrid retrieval strategy, our framework demonstrates robust performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations reveal that incorporating layout-aware search and VLM-based candidate verification significantly enhances retrieval accuracy, achieving a top performance score of 65.56. This work underscores the potential of scalable and reproducible solutions in advancing multimodal document retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Diversity in Example Selection for In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has gained prominence due to its ability to perform tasks without requiring extensive training data and its robustness to noisy labels. A typical ICL workflow involves selecting localized examples relevant to a given input using sparse or dense embedding-based similarity functions. However, relying solely on similarity-based selection may introduce topical biases in the retrieved contexts, potentially leading to suboptimal downstream performance. We posit that reranking the retrieved context to enhance topical diversity can improve downstream task performance. To achieve this, we leverage maximum marginal relevance (MMR) which balances topical similarity with inter-example diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that diversifying the selected examples leads to consistent improvements in downstream performance across various context sizes and similarity functions. The implementation of our approach is made available at https://github.com/janak11111/Diverse-ICL.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Contrastive Feedback for Effective User Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating user behavior in the domain of Interactive Information Retrieval has recently gained significant popularity. However, their application and capabilities remain highly debated and understudied. This study explores whether the underlying principles of contrastive training techniques, which have been effective for fine-tuning LLMs, can also be applied beneficially in the area of prompt engineering for user simulations.
  Previous research has shown that LLMs possess comprehensive world knowledge, which can be leveraged to provide accurate estimates of relevant documents. This study attempts to simulate a knowledge state by enhancing the model with additional implicit contextual information gained during the simulation. This approach enables the model to refine the scope of desired documents further. The primary objective of this study is to analyze how different modalities of contextual information influence the effectiveness of user simulations.
  Various user configurations were tested, where models are provided with summaries of already judged relevant, irrelevant, or both types of documents in a contrastive manner. The focus of this study is the assessment of the impact of the prompting techniques on the simulated user agent performance. We hereby lay the foundations for leveraging LLMs as part of more realistic simulated users.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Exploratory Learning-Aided Community Detection Under Topological Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social networks, the discovery of community structures has received considerable attention as a fundamental problem in various network analysis tasks. However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrate: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 65.55% on the Facebook dataset over the best competitor among our selected competitive methods in terms of normalized mutual information (NMI), (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, and (d) the convergence of the inferred network.</description>
