      <title>Stochastic Reconstruction of the Speed of Sound in Breast Ultrasound Computed Tomography with Phase Encoding in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) has recently re-emerged as a powerful, safe and operator-independent way to image the breast. State of the art image reconstruction methods are performed with iterative techniques based on deterministic optimization algorithms in the frequency domain in the 300 kHz - 1 MHz bandwidth. Alternative algorithms with deterministic and stochastic optimization have been considered in the time-domain. In this paper, we present the equivalent stochastic inversion in the frequency domain (phase encoding), with a focus on reconstructing the speed of sound. We test the inversion algorithm on synthetic data in 2D and 3D, by explicitly differentiating between inverse crime and non-inverse crime scenarios, and compare against the deterministic inversion. We then show the results of the stochastic inversion in the frequency domain on experimental data. By leveraging on the concepts of multiple super-shots and stochastic ensembles, we provide robust evidence that image quality of a stochastic reconstruction of the speed of sound with phase encoding in the frequency domain is comparable, and essentially equivalent, to the one of a deterministic reconstruction, with the further benefit of drastically reducing reconstruction times by more than half.</description>

      <title>Beam hardening correction of Bremsstrahlung X-ray computed tomography measurements and required measurement accuracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doing quantitative computed tomography (CT) using Bremsstrahlung sources requires an estimate of the spectrum emitted by the X-ray source. One method of beam hardening correction (BHC), as described by Lifton[1], first uses transmission measurements of a known material and range of thicknesses to estimate the spectrum and then uses the estimated spectrum to correct the beam hardening error, not necessarily on the same material as used for estimating the spectrum. We adopt Lifton's BHC procedure and through simulations show how the uncertainties in the transmission measurements and the uncertainties in the material thickness measurements propagate to uncertainties in the spectrum, the beam hardening correction curve and thence to uncertainties in the beam hardening corrected CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Free Precession NMR in the Presence of Heteronuclear Couplings and Decoupling: More Than Meets the Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier Transform (FT) has been a mainstay of analytical 13C and 15N NMR. On the other hand it has been shown that Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) experiments which depart from this scheme can, under certain conditions, endow 13C and 15N small molecule NMR with comparable sensitivity and resolution. SSFP is one of the earliest and most widely used NMR pulse sequences, yet its analyses have focused on isolated spin-half ensembles such as water. The present study demonstrates that significant deviations from such isolated spin-half behavior may occur when SSFP is applied in the presence of spin-spin couplings. Even in the simplest case supporting such couplings, a single 13C J coupled to a 1H, departures from the isolated spin-half behavior arise in the 13C SSFP response, both in the absence and in the presence of 1H spin decoupling. In the former case deviations are produced by the differential relaxation of antiphase two-spin terms generated by the pulse train; in the latter case, magnified interferences may arise between the SSFP pulses and the coherent perturbation arising upon 1H decoupling. Although both phenomena are also known in FT NMR, the spectral distortions that they will originate may be much larger in the SSFP case, particularly if interpulse delays in large flip angle SSFP pulse trains resonate with the coupling perturbations. The origins of these effects are here analyzed for heteronuclear spin-half systems and corroborated with 13C NMR SSFP experiments recorded under different conditions. Additional considerations aimed at magnifying or suppressing these effects, as well as extensions to more complex scenarios, are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Conceptualization of ionization dose to water for dosimetry in external beam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: This paper aims to conceptualize the ionization dose to water, which is the dose absorbed to water and expended on ionization, to represent more relevant medical doses, and formulate its dosimetry procedures for high-energy photon, electron, proton, and ion beams. It also aims to design ionization chamber gases to reduce dosimetric uncertainty for proton and ion beams. Methods: Based on the international code of practice, the dosimetry procedure excluding the energy-per-ionization correction and that further excluding the stopping-power-ratio correction were formulated. For the latter, water-equivalent gases (WEG) were designed to be used in gas-sealed ionization chambers for proton and ion beams. The proposed dosimetry procedures, where the ionization dose is calibrated to a reference absorbed dose in the standard dosimeter calibration with 60Co gamma rays, were simulated for test beams. Results: The calibrated ionization dose virtually measured with a common ionization chamber was demonstrated to be compatible with the absorbed dose for high-energy photon and electron beams, and with slightly reduced uncertainty from 1.4% to 1.3% for a proton beam and from 2.4% to 1.9% for an ion beam. With a WEG ionization chamber, the uncertainty was further reduced to 0.7% for the proton beam and 1.0% for the ion beam. Conclusions: The new dose concept, calibrated ionization dose to water, may be used compatibly in current radiotherapy practice. Its minimized beam-quality correction will be advantageous for complex clinical beams of various types and in non-reference conditions not covered by the standard dosimetry procedures.</description>

      <title>Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing. Treatment replanning is often required to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning process as a reinforcement learning problem where agents learn control policies to adjust optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based approaches, our framework trains agents for each patient using their planning Computed Tomography (CT) and augmented anatomies simulating anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific approach leverages anatomical similarities along the treatment course, enabling effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments. Evaluation on eight HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed that both agents improved initial plan scores from $120.78 \pm 17.18$ to $139.59 \pm 5.50$ (DQN) and $141.50 \pm 4.69$ (PPO), surpassing the replans manually generated by a human planner ($136.32 \pm 4.79$). Clinical validation confirms that improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse anatomical changes. This work highlights DRL's potential in addressing geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton therapy.</description>
