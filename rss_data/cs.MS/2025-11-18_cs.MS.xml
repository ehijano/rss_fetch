      <title>An Innovative Algorithm For Robust, Interactive, Piecewise-Linear Data Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many mathematical modelling tasks (such as in Economics and Finance) are informed by data that is "found" rather than being the result of carefully designed experiments. This often results in data series that are short, noisy, multidimensional and contaminated with outliers, regime shifts, and confounding, uninformative or co-linear variables.
  We present a generalization of the Theil-Sen algorithm to reflect modes (rather than the median) in the parameter space distribution (of partial fits to the data). This can provide a robust piecewise-linear fit to the data while also allowing for extensions to including elements of cluster analysis, regularization and cross-validation in a unified (distribution free) approach that can:- 1. Exploit piecewise linearity to reduce the need to pre-specify the form of the underlying data generating process. 2. Detect non-homogeneity (e.g. regime shifts, multiple data generating processes etc.) in the data using an innovative non-parametric (Hamming-Distance/Affinity-Matrix) cluster analysis technique. 3. Enable dimension reduction and resistance to the effects of multi-co-linearity by including LASSO regularization as an integral part of the algorithm. 4. Estimate measures of accuracy, such as standard errors, bias, and confidence intervals, without needing to rely on traditional distributional assumptions.
  Taken together these extensions to the traditional Theil-Sen algorithm simplify the traditional process of parameter fitting by providing a single-stage analysis controlled by a multidimensional search of Scale/Parsimony/Precision hyper-parameters. These are early days in this research and the main limitation in this approach is that it assumes that compute power is infinite and compute time is small enough to allow interactive use.</description>

      <title>Case study of a differentiable heterogeneous multiphysics solver for a nuclear fusion application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a case study of a heterogeneous multiphysics solver from the nuclear fusion domain. At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping.</description>

      <title>Efficient Solvers for SLOPE in R, Python, Julia, and C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of packages in R, Python, Julia, and C++ that efficiently solve the Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) problem. The packages feature a highly efficient hybrid coordinate descent algorithm that fits generalized linear models (GLMs) and supports a variety of loss functions, including Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial logistic regression. Our implementation is designed to be fast, memory-efficient, and flexible. The packages support a variety of data structures (dense, sparse, and out-of-memory matrices) and are designed to efficiently fit the full SLOPE path as well as handle cross-validation of SLOPE models, including the relaxed SLOPE. We present examples of how to use the packages and benchmarks that demonstrate the performance of the packages on both real and simulated data and show that our packages outperform existing implementations of SLOPE in terms of speed.</description>
