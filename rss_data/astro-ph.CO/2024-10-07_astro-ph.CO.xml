      <title>The galaxy-IGM connection in THESAN: observability and information content of the galaxy-Lyman-$\alpha$ cross-correlation at z$\geq$6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy--Lyman-$\alpha$ cross-correlation (GaLaCC) is a promising tool to study the interplay of galaxies and inter-galactic medium (IGM) in the first billion years of the Universe. Here we thoroughly characterise the impact of observational limitations on our ability to retrieve the intrinsic GaLaCC and provide new physical insights on its origin and connection to other IGM properties. This is extremely relevant to identify promising datasets, design future surveys and assess the limitations of current measurements. We find that sightline-to-sightline variations demand at least 25 independent sightlines to quantitatively recover the true signal. Once this condition is met, the intrinsic signal can be recovered even for a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution. The galaxy selection method does not affect the inferred GaLaCC and lightcone effects are only relevant for redshift windows $\Delta z \gtrsim 0.5$. We discuss the implications of these findings for previous theoretical studies. We elucidate explicitly for the first time the physical origin of the GaLaCC and demonstrate that this signal is collectively sourced by the ensemble of galaxies residing in overdense regions rather than individual objects. We show that GaLaCC measured for opaque sightlines shows a larger peak at smaller scales with respect to transparent lines of sight. We connect this to the evolution of the mean free path of ionizing photons, showing that GaLaCC peak position has a very similar evolution but on smaller scales, as it probes only the core of ionised regions. Finally, we discuss which ongoing surveys can be used to measure the GaLaCC and provide an initial analysis of future developments, including using galaxies as background sources. Our results outline a bright future for the GaLaCC as a tool to unveil the galaxy-IGM interplay during the first billion years of the Universe.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-IGM connection in THESAN: the physics connecting the IGM Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity and galaxy density in the reionization epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between the Lyman-$\alpha$ effective optical depth of quasar sightlines ($\tau_\mathrm{los}$) and the distribution of galaxies around them is an emerging probe of the connection between the first collapsed structures and the IGM properties at the tail end of cosmic reionization. We employ the THESAN simulations to demonstrate that $\tau_\mathrm{los}$ is most sensitive to galaxies at a redshift-dependent distance, reflecting the growth of ionized regions around sources of photons and in agreement with studies of the galaxy--Lyman-$\alpha$ cross correlation. This is $d \sim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ at the tail end of reionization. The flagship THESAN run struggles to reproduce the most opaque sightlines as well as those with large galaxy densities, likely as a consequence of its limited volume. We identify a promising region of parameter space to probe with future observations in order to distinguish both the timing and sources of reionization. We present an investigation of the IGM physical conditions around opaque and transparent spectra, revealing that they probe regions that reionized inside-out and outside-in, respectively, and demonstrate that residual neutral islands at the end of reionization are not required to produce optical depths of $\tau_\mathrm{los} &gt; 4$, although they facilitate the task. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of the aforementioned results to the nature of ionizing sources and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Galaxy Cluster Mass Maps using Score-based Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to reconstruct gas and dark matter projected density maps of galaxy clusters using score-based generative modeling. Our diffusion model takes in mock SZ and X-ray images as conditional observations, and generates realizations of corresponding gas and dark matter maps by sampling from a learned data posterior. We train and validate the performance of our model by using mock data from a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation. The model accurately reconstructs both the mean and spread of the radial density profiles in the spatial domain to within 5\%, indicating that the model is able to distinguish between clusters of different sizes. In the spectral domain, the model achieves close-to-unity values for the bias and cross-correlation coefficients, indicating that the model can accurately probe cluster structures on both large and small scales. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of score models to learn a strong, nonlinear, and unbiased mapping between input observables and fundamental density distributions of galaxy clusters. These diffusion models can be further fine-tuned and generalized to not only take in additional observables as inputs, but also real observations and predict unknown density distributions of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark photon dark matter from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest simulations and an ultra-high signal-to-noise quasar spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultralight dark photon is a well-motivated, hypothetical dark matter candidate. In a dilute plasma, they can resonantly convert into photons, and heat up the intergalactic medium between galaxies. In this work, we explore the dark photon dark matter parameter space by comparing synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to observational data from VLT/UVES of the quasar HE0940-1050 ($z_{\rm em}=3.09$). We use a novel flux normalization technique that targets under-dense gas, reshaping the flux probability distribution. Not only do we place robust constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter of dark photon dark matter, but notably our findings suggest that this model can still reconcile simulated and observed Doppler parameter distributions of $z\sim0$ Lyman-$\alpha$ lines, as seen by HST/COS. This work opens new pathways for the use of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to explore new physics, and can be extended to other scenarios such as primordial black hole evaporation, dark matter decay, and annihilation.</description>

      <title>Along the Primary Curve: Simultaneous Source and Lens Reconstruction of Bright Arcs in Cluster Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon arising when light rays are deflected by the mass between the source and the observer. Largely magnified and highly distorted images of background galaxies are formed by these angular deflections if the deflecting mass distribution and the background sources align. As the most massive gravitationally bound objects in the universe, galaxy clusters are places where such alignments are usually found. By carefully analyzing the images of lensed galaxies, one can measure the mass, both visible and invisible, along the line-of-sight. These measurements are crucial in investigating the nature of dark matter, which constitutes most of the mass within clusters. Existing lensing analysis methods typically forward model the multiple images of dozens of background galaxies lensed by the cluster. To make this forward modeling computationally tractable, these multiple images are reduced to a much smaller summary data vector, which includes the locations, magnifications, and distortions. Our work avoids this loss of information by forward modeling the data at pixel-level. We develop a parametric model for the angular deflections near the bright arcs that allows us to control the shape of the curve that gives the directions of the eigenvectors of the Jacobian of the lensing matrix. The bright and extended images often follow such curves. We apply our analysis method to the bright arcs in gravitational lenses SDSS J1110+6459 and SDSS J0004-0103. We present our lens and source reconstructions for each system. With the application of our new method to many other lensing systems, we anticipate significant improvement in lens modeling near the critical curve, which will provide higher precision mass reconstructions for the deflectors. High-precision lens models allow for more robust de-lensing, which aids the studies of various highly magnified sources.</description>

      <title>LOFAR high-band antenna observations of the Perseus cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perseus cluster is the brightest X-ray cluster in the sky and is known as a cool-core galaxy cluster. Being a very nearby cluster, it has been extensively studied. This has provided a comprehensive view of the physical processes that operate in the intracluster medium (ICM), including feedback from the AGN 3C84 and measurements of ICM turbulence. Additionally, the Perseus cluster contains a central radio mini-halo. This diffuse radio source traces cosmic ray electrons (re-)accelerated in-situ in the ICM.
  Here we report on LOFAR high-band antenna 120-168 MHz observations of the Perseus cluster that probe a range of four orders of magnitude in angular scales. In our 0.3 arcsec resolution image, we find that the northern extension of the 3C84 lobe consists of several narrow 1.5-3 kpc parallel strands of emission. In addition, we detect steep-spectrum filaments associated with a previous outburst of the central AGN radio emission filling two known X-ray ghost cavities. At 7 arcsec resolution, our images show a complex structured radio mini-halo, with several edges and filaments. At resolutions of 26 arcsec and 80 arcsec, we discover diffuse radio emission with a 1.1 Mpc extent. We classify this emission as a giant radio halo and its properties are distinct from the inner mini-halo. We also detect two diffuse sources at projected cluster centric radii of 0.7 and 1.0 Mpc. Finally, we observe a 0.9 Mpc long trail of radio emission from the cluster member galaxy IC310, connecting it with the giant radio halo. Together with other recent studies of relaxed clusters, our LOFAR observations indicate that cluster-wide radio emission could be (more) common in cool-core clusters. In the case of the Perseus cluster, a past off-axis merger event that preserved the cool core might have generated enough turbulence to produce an extended radio halo observable at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Constraining Galaxy-Halo Connection Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) methods to model small-scale galaxy clustering for constraining Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) parameters. Our analysis reveals that while many ML algorithms report good statistical fits, they often yield likelihood contours that are significantly biased in both mean values and variances relative to the true model parameters. This highlights the importance of careful data processing and algorithm selection in ML applications for galaxy clustering, as even seemingly robust methods can lead to biased results if not applied correctly. ML tools offer a promising approach to exploring the HOD parameter space with significantly reduced computational costs compared to traditional brute-force methods if their robustness is established. Using our ANN-based pipeline, we successfully recreate some standard results from recent literature. Properly restricting the HOD parameter space, transforming the training data, and carefully selecting ML algorithms are essential for achieving unbiased and robust predictions. Among the methods tested, artificial neural networks (ANNs) outperform random forests (RF) and ridge regression in predicting clustering statistics, when the HOD prior space is appropriately restricted. We demonstrate these findings using the projected two-point correlation function ($w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$), angular multipoles of the correlation function ($\xi_\ell(r)$), and the void probability function (VPF) of Luminous Red Galaxies from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument mocks. Our results show that while combining $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$ and VPF improves parameter constraints, adding the multipoles $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, and $\xi_4$ to $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$ does not significantly improve the constraints.</description>

      <title>Large scale structure prior knowledge in the dark siren method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave dark sirens are a powerful tool for cosmology and inference of compact object population hyperparameters. They allow for a measurement of the luminosity distance to the source, but not their redshift. Galaxy catalogues in the source localization volume can be used to infer the redshift of the source in a statistical manner. Catalogues are, however, limited by their incompleteness, which can be significant at redshifts corresponding to current GW events. In this work, we detail how to implement in practice variance completion, a novel galaxy completion method which uses knowledge of the large scale structure to optimize the potential of dark sirens analyses. We compress the prediction for the missing number of galaxies into a ratio between the predictions of variance completion and the standard homogeneous completion method. This ratio format can be easily incorporated into existing line of sight computations used in dark sirens software; we demonstrate this procedure using the GLADE+ galaxy catalogue and the gwcosmo software package. We discuss the robustness of the method, and apply it to well-localized event GW190814 as a proof of concept. Finally, we apply the method to data from the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, finding that it yields results that are consistent with homogeneous completion. We also discuss the prospects for an improvement if the GW localization volume shrinks.</description>

      <title>LOO-PIT: A sensitive posterior test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of the next generation of astrophysics experiments, the volume of data available to researchers will be greater than ever. As these projects will significantly drive down statistical uncertainties in measurements, it is crucial to develop novel tools to assess the ability of our models to fit these data within the specified errors. We introduce to astronomy the Leave One Out-Probability Integral Transform (LOO-PIT) technique. This first estimates the LOO posterior predictive distributions based on the model and likelihood distribution specified, then evaluates the quality of the match between the model and data by applying the PIT to each estimated distribution and data point, outputting a LOO-PIT distribution. Deviations between this output distribution and that expected can be characterised visually and with a standard Kolmogorov--Smirnov distribution test. We compare LOO-PIT and the more common $\chi^2$ test using both a simplified model and a more realistic astrophysics problem, where we consider fitting Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in galaxy survey data with contamination from emission line interlopers. LOO-PIT and $\chi^2$ tend to find different signals from the contaminants, and using these tests in conjunction increases the statistical power compared to using either test alone. We also show that LOO-PIT outperforms $\chi^2$ in certain realistic test cases.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Gravitational Vector Modes and their Magnetogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>

      <title>BLAST: Beyond Limber Angular power Spectra Toolkit. A fast and efficient algorithm for 3x2 pt analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys is approaching, bringing more data with tighter error bars. As a result, theoretical models will become more complex, incorporating additional parameters, which will increase the dimensionality of the parameter space and make posteriors more challenging to explore. Consequently, the need to improve and speed up our current analysis pipelines will grow. In this work, we focus on the 3x2 pt statistics, a summary statistic that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its great constraining power. These statistics involve calculating angular two-point correlation functions for the auto- and cross-correlations between galaxy clustering and weak lensing. The corresponding model is determined by integrating the product of the power spectrum and two highly-oscillating Bessel functions over three dimensions, which makes the evaluation particularly challenging. Typically, this difficulty is circumvented by employing the so-called Limber approximation, which is an important source of error. We present Blast.jl, an innovative and efficient algorithm for calculating angular power spectra without employing the Limber approximation or assuming a scale-dependent growth rate, based on the use of Chebyshev polynomials. The algorithm is compared with the publicly available beyond-Limber codes, whose performances were recently tested by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration in the N5K challenge. At similar accuracy, Blast.jl is $\approx 10$-$15 \times$ faster than the winning method of the challenge, also showing excellent scaling with respect to various hyper-parameters.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. I. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Initial Conditions Beyond CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $72$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only N-body zoom-in simulations with initial conditions beyond cold, collisionless dark matter (CDM), as the first installment of the COZMIC suite. We simulate Milky Way (MW) analogs with linear matter power spectra, $P(k)$ for: i) thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,4,5,6,6.5,10]~\mathrm{keV}$, ii) fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}\in [25.9,69.4,113,151,185,490]\times 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$, and iii) interacting dark matter (IDM) with a velocity-dependent elastic proton scattering cross section $\sigma=\sigma_0 v^n$ relative particle velocity scaling $n\in [2,4]$, and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}\in[10^{-4},~ 10^{-2},~ 1]~\mathrm{GeV}$. Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression is significantly steeper in FDM versus WDM, while dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$ can reduce SHMF suppression for IDM. We fit SHMF models to our simulation results and derive new bounds on WDM and FDM from the MW satellite population, obtaining $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;5.9~\mathrm{keV}$ and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}&gt;1.4\times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ at $95\%$ confidence; these limits are $\approx 10\%$ weaker and $5\times$ stronger than previous constraints due to the updated transfer functions and SHMF models, respectively. We estimate IDM bounds for $n=2$ ($n=4$) and obtain $\sigma_0 &lt; 1.0\times 10^{-27}$, $1.3\times 10^{-24}$, and $3.1\times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($\sigma_0 &lt; 9.9\times 10^{-27}$, $9.8\times 10^{-21}$, and $2.1\times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{cm}^2$) for $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}=10^{-4}$, $10^{-2}$, and $1$ GeV, respectively. Thus, future development of IDM SHMF models can improve IDM cross section bounds by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ with current data. COZMIC presents an important step toward accurate small-scale structure modeling in beyond-CDM cosmologies, critical to upcoming observational searches for DM physics.</description>

      <title>First results from a search for axionlike dark matter using octupole-deformed nuclei in a crystal</title>

Abstract: Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter. However, dark matter has never been observed to interact with normal matter in laboratory experiments. ALPs -- ultralight axionlike particles -- are a class of dark matter models that are consistent with astrophysical constraints, and produce measurable signatures in the form of oscillating violations of discrete symmetries in nuclei. We report the first results from a search for oscillating parity-odd time-reversal-odd nuclear moments of $^{153}$Eu ions in a crystal, which leads to an experimental constraint on the ALP-gluon coupling strength across a wide band of ALP masses.</description>

      <title>SIMP dark matter during reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) has become one of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates due to its capability of addressing the small-scale anomaly, where the final DM abundance is set via the freeze-out of $3\rightarrow 2$ or $4\rightarrow 2$ annihilation process involving solely the dark sector particles. In this work, we explore the freeze-out of SIMP DM during the inflationary reheating epoch. During reheating, the radiation energy density evolves differently based on the shape of inflaton potential and spin of its decay products than the standard radiation-dominated picture; as a result, in this scenario, the freeze-out temperature varies distinctly with DM mass compared to the standard case. Large entropy injection due to inflaton decay demands a smaller cross-section to satisfy the observed relic than the standard radiation-dominated freeze-out case. The required cross-section, satisfying the relic density constraint and the maximum allowed thermally averaged cross-section by the unitarity of the $S$-matrix, set an upper limit on the DM mass. The upper bound on the mass of the dark matter for $3\rightarrow2$ ( $4\rightarrow2$ ) is $1$ GeV ($7$ MeV), assuming a radiation-dominated background. Interstingly, these limits get relaxed to $10^6$ ($10^4$) GeV for $3\rightarrow2$ ( $4\rightarrow2$ ) SIMP dark matter for quadratic inflaton potential. We find that a small amount of DM parameter space survives for reheating with quadratic inflaton potential after considering the lower bound of reheating temperature, put by the latest CMB observation depending on the inflationary models. In the case of the quartic inflaton potential, the allowed DM parameter space gets reduced compared to the quadratic case.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present superconducting vortex solutions in the two-Higgs doublet model which has a gauged $U(1)$ Higgs-family symmetry. We write down an ansatz for the solution and study its basic properties, for the case of both global and gauged symmetries. We demonstrate its prima-facie stability using 3D numerical simulations of a global version of the theory, observing the flow of current along the string. We discuss how generic such a phenomena might be and the possible consequences if such a model is found in nature.</description>

      <title>Lowering the strong coupling mode of modified teleparallel gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the strong coupling problem in modified teleparallel gravity theories using the effective field theory (EFT) approach, demonstrating that it is possible to shift the emergence of new degrees of freedom (DoFs) to lower orders in perturbation theory. We first focus on the case of $f(T)$ gravity, and we show that in its conformally equivalent form the scalar perturbations are non-dynamical up to the cubic action. We then propose a simple modification of the theory, which lowers the appearance of new DoFs to cubic order, compared to the quartic order in standard $f(T)$ gravity. Our work opens a new avenue to address the issue of strong coupling in modified teleparallel gravity, and suggests a new classification scheme of these theories based on the perturbative order at which new DoFs appear.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical effects on the mass function of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ begin the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Ellipsoidal Primordial Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Quadratic Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The induced conservative tidal response of self-gravitating objects in general relativity is parametrized in terms of a set of coefficients, which are commonly referred to as Love numbers. For asymptotically-flat black holes in four spacetime dimensions, the Love numbers are notoriously zero in the static regime. In this work, we show that this result continues to hold upon inclusion of nonlinearities in the theory for Schwarzschild black holes. We first solve the quadratic Einstein equations in the static limit to all orders in the multipolar expansion, including both even and odd perturbations. We show that the second-order solutions take simple analytic expressions, generically expressible in the form of finite polynomials. We then define the quadratic Love numbers at the level of the point-particle effective field theory. By performing the matching with the full solution in general relativity, we show that quadratic Love number coefficients are zero to all orders in the derivative expansion, like the linear ones.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Void-Finding Algorithms using Crossing Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how well void-finding algorithms identify cosmic void regions and whether we can quantitatively and qualitatively compare the voids they find with dynamical information from the underlying matter distribution. Using the ORIGAMI algorithm to determine the number of dimensions along which dark matter particles have undergone shell-crossing (crossing number) in N-body simulations from the AbacusSummit simulation suite, we identify dark matter particles that have undergone no shell crossing as belonging to voids. We then find voids in the corresponding halo distribution using two different void-finding algorithms: VoidFinder and Voronoi Voids (V2), a ZOBOV-based algorithm. The resulting void catalogs are compared to the distribution of dark matter particles to examine how their crossing numbers depend on void proximity. While both algorithms' voids have a similar distribution of crossing numbers near their centers, we find that beyond 0.25 times the effective void radius, voids found by VoidFinder exhibit a stronger preference for particles with low crossing numbers than those found by V2. We examine two possible methods of mitigating this difference in efficacy between the algorithms. While we are able to partially mitigate the ineffectiveness of V2 by using the distance from the void edge as a measure of centrality, we conclude that VoidFinder more reliably identifies dynamically distinct regions of low crossing number.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Everpresent $\Lambda$ (II): Cosmological Tests of Current Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Everpresent $\Lambda$, a stochastic dark energy model motivated by causal set theory and unimodular gravity, and confronts it with two key observational data sets, Supernova Ia (SN Ia) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. A key feature of this model is that $\Lambda$ fluctuates over time and on average the magnitude of its fluctuations is of the order of the dominant energy density (be it radiation or matter) for the given epoch. In particular, we focus on a phenomenological implementation of Everpresent $\Lambda$ known as Model 1. The random fluctuations in Everpresent $\Lambda$ realizations are generated using seed numbers, and we find that for a small fraction of seeds Model 1 is capable of producing realizations that fit SN Ia data better than $\Lambda$CDM. We further investigate what features distinguish these realizations from the more general behaviour, and find that the "good'' realizations have relatively small fluctuations at low redshifts ($z&lt;1.5$), which do not closely track the matter density. We find that Model 1 struggles to improve on $\Lambda$CDM at describing the CMB data. However, by suppressing the values of $\Lambda$ near the last scattering surface, as suggested in arXiv:1703.06265, we find a large improvement in the best fit of the model, though still with a $\chi^2$ value much larger than that of $\Lambda$CDM. We also study the allowed variation of the dark energy density by the CMB constraints in a more model-independent manner, and find that some variation (especially prior to recombination) is possible and in fact can lead to improvement over $\Lambda$CDM and reduce the Hubble tension, in line with some early dark energy proposals. However, for the kinds of variations considered, the favoured fluctuations are smaller in magnitude than is typical in current Everpresent $\Lambda$ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a tool for the analysis of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from cosmological first-order phase transitions with LISA: we initiate a template databank for these signals, prototype their searches, and forecast their reconstruction. The templates encompass the gravitational wave signals sourced by bubble collisions, sound waves and turbulence. Accounting for Galactic and extra-Galactic foregrounds, we forecast the region of the parameter space that LISA will reconstruct with better than $\sim 10\,\%$ accuracy, if certain experimental and theoretical uncertainties are solved by the time LISA flies. We illustrate the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the parameters on a few benchmark signals, both in terms of the template parameters and the phase transition ones. To show the impact of the forecasts on physics beyond the Standard Model, we map the reconstructed benchmark measurements into the parameter spaces of the singlet extension of the Standard Model and of the classically conformal invariant $U(1)_{B-L}$ model.</description>

      <title>Distributions and Collision Rates of ALP Stars in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply current analytical knowledge on the characteristic mass and linear evolution of miniclusters down to redshift $z=0$ to the hypothetical minicluster distribution of the Milky Way. Using the mass-radius relation and a core-halo relation for stable soliton solutions composed of axion-like particles (ALPs), we connect the galactic minicluster mass distribution to that of their ALP star cores. We consider different temperature evolutions of the ALP field with masses in the range $10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-3}\,$eV and infer the abundance and properties of QCD axion- and ALP stars in our galaxy. We re-evaluate detection prospects for collisions of neutron stars with both ALP stars and miniclusters as well as relativistic ALP bursts, so-called Bosenovae. Our analysis shows that the collision rates between miniclusters and neutron stars can become as large as $\sim 10^5\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, but that the fraction of encounters that can lead to resonance between ALP mass and magnetosphere plasma frequency is generally well below $\sim 1\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, depending on the ALP model. We confirm previous results that merger rates of ALP stars are extremely small $&lt; 10^{-12}\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, while their host miniclusters can merge much more frequently, up to $\sim 10^3\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ for the QCD axion. We find that Bosenovae and parametric resonance are much more likely to lead to observable signatures than neutron star encounters. We also suggest that a combination of accretion and parametric resonance can lead to observable radio lines for a wide range of ALP masses $m_a$ and photon-couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <title>Forward modeling fluctuations in the DESI LRGs target sample using image simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the forward modeling pipeline, Obiwan, to study the imaging systematics of the Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) targeted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We update the Obiwan pipeline, which had previously been developed to simulate the optical images used to target DESI data, to further simulate WISE images in the infrared. This addition makes it possible to simulate the DESI LRGs sample, which utilizes WISE data in the target selection. Deep DESI imaging data combined with a method to account for biases in their shapes is used to define a truth sample of potential LRG targets. We simulate a total of 15 million galaxies to obtain a simulated LRG sample (Obiwan LRGs) that predicts the variations in target density due to imaging properties. We find that the simulations predict the trends with depth observed in the data, including how they depend on the intrinsic brightness of the galaxies. We observe that faint LRGs are the main contributing power of the imaging systematics trend induced by depth. We also find significant trends in the data against Galactic extinction that are not predicted by Obiwan. These trends depend strongly on the particular map of Galactic extinction chosen to test against, implying Large-Scale Structure systematic contamination (e.g. Cosmic-Infrared Background) in the Galactic extinction maps is a likely root cause. We additionally observe that the DESI LRGs sample exhibits a complex dependency on a combination of seeing, depth, and intrinsic galaxy brightness, which is not replicated by Obiwan, suggesting discrepancies between the current simulation settings and the actual observations. The detailed findings we present should be used to guide any observational systematics mitigation treatment for the clustering of the DESI LRG sample.</description>

      <title>The Bispectrum in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bispectrum in Lagrangian perturbation theory. Extending past results for the power spectrum, we describe a method to efficiently compute the bispectrum in LPT, focusing on the Zeldovich approximation, in which contributions due to linear displacements are captured to all orders in a manifestly infrared (IR) safe way. We then isolate the effects of these linear displacements on oscillatory components of the power spectrum like baryon acoustic oscillations or inflationary primordial features and show that the Eulerian perturbation theory (EPT) prescription wherein their effects are resummed by a Gaussian damping of the oscillations arise as a saddle-point approximation of our calculation. These two methods of IR resummation are in excellent agreement at 1-loop in the bispectrum. At tree level, resummed EPT does less well to capture the nonlinear damping of the oscillations, and the LPT calculation does not require an artificial split of the power spectrum into smooth and oscillatory components, making the latter particularly useful for modeling exotic features. We finish by extending our analysis of IR resummation in LPT to N-point functions of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistical Effects on Warm Dark Matter and the Mass Constraint from the Cosmic Structure at Small Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The suppression of the small-scale matter power spectrum is a distinct feature of Warm Dark Matter (WDM), which permits a constraint on the WDM mass from galaxy surveys. In the thermal relic WDM scenario, quantum statistical effects are not manifest. In a unified framework, we investigate the quantum statistical effects for a fermion case with a degenerate pressure and a boson case with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Compared to the thermal relic case, the degenerate fermion case only slightly lowers the mass bound, while the boson case with a high initial BEC fraction ($\gtrsim90\%$) significantly lowers it. On the other hand, the BEC fraction drops during the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition and completely disappears if the initial fraction is below $\sim64$\%. Given the rising interest in resolving the late-time galaxy-scale problems with boson condensation, a question is posed on how a high initial BEC fraction can be dynamically created so that a condensed DM component remains today.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Halo bias in the peak model. A first-principles non-parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation fail in reproducing the halo bias found in simulations, while the excursion set-peaks (ESP) formalism built in the peak model reproduces it only at high masses and does not address in a fully satisfactory manner peak nesting and the mass and time of ellipsoidal collapse of triaxial peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed density field. Here we apply the CUSP formalism fixing all these issues from first principles and with no free parameters to infer the Lagrangian local peak bias parameters, which adopt very simple analytic expressions similar to those found in the PS and ES models. The predicted Eulerian linear halo bias recovers the results of simulations. More specifically, we show that the only small departure observed at intermediate and low masses can be due to the spurious halo splitting and grouping caused by the Spherical Overdensity halo-finding algorithm used in simulations.</description>

      <title>Origin and full characterization of the secondary (assembly) halo bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clustering of dark matter halos depends not only on their mass, the so-called primary bias, but also on their internal properties, the so-called secondary bias. While the former effect is well-understood within the Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation, the latter is not. In those models, protohalos are fully characterised by their height and scale, which determine the halo mass and collapse time, so there is no room for any other halo property. This is why the secondary bias was believed not to be innate but due to the distinct merger rate of halos lying in different backgrounds, and dubbed assembly bias. However, it is now admitted that mergers leave no imprint in the inner halo properties. In fact, the innate origin of the secondary bias cannot be discarded because, in the more realistic peak model of structure formation, halo seeds are characterized by one additional property: the peak curvature. Here we use the confluent system of peak trajectories (CUSP) formalism to show that peaks lying in different backgrounds have different mean curvatures, which in turn cause them to evolve in halos with different typical inner properties. The dependence we find of the properties on halo background (or halo clustering) reproduces the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum of haloes arises from the tidal torque produced on protohaloes by the mass fluctuations around them. That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random overdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more realistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two fundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by Gaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown ellipsoidal collapse time of those triaxial patches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only. This Paper is the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the halo angular momentum. In the present Paper we use the CUSP formalism fixing all those issues to deal with the TTT from a full peak model viewpoint, i.e. not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified to a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also seen as a peak or a hole. This way we obtain a simple analytic expression for the Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the shape: a multi-wavelength analysis of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamical state of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307 from the optical point of view, presenting a coherent scenario that responds to the X-ray emissions observed in these structures. Our study is based on 231 and 164 spectroscopic redshifts, for the clusters A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that A76 and A1307 are two galaxy clusters at $z=0.0390$ and 0.0815, respectively, with velocity dispersions of $650 \pm 56$ km s$^{-1}$ and $863 \pm 85$ km s$^{-1}$, and showing velocity distributions following, in practice, Gaussian profiles. From our dynamical analysis, X-ray studies and SZ-Planck emission, we obtain a mean total mass M$_{500} = 1.7 \pm 0.6 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $3.5 \pm 1.3 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ for A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that the spatial distribution of likely cluster members in the case of A76 is very anisotropic, while A1307 shows a compact distribution of galaxies, but double peaked and elongated in the south-north direction. we compare the XMM-Newton surface brightness maps with galaxy distributions and see that both distributions are correlated. We reconstruct the total mass profile and velocity anisotropy of both clusters by analysing the full projected phase space, through the MG-MAMPOSSt code. Our study reveals a slight indication of radial orbits for A76, while A1307 seems to prefer more isotropic orbits in the whole cluster range. Summarizing, A76 represent a typical young cluster, in an early stage of formation, with a very low X-ray surface brightness but high temperature showing a very anisotropic galaxy distribution. A1307 is however more consolidated and massive showing in-homogeneous galaxy distribution and an asymmetric X-ray emission, which suggest a scenario characterised by recent minor mergers.</description>

      <title>The Sommerfeld enhancement at NLO and the dark matter unitarity bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on dark matter freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect dark matter annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the dark matter mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable, relativistic UV completion.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dynamical Friction on the Tidal Formation of NGC 1052-DF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of dark matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs) through tidal interactions has been a subject of growing interest, particularly with the discovery of galaxies such as NGC 1052-DF2. Previous studies suggested that strong tidal forces could strip dark matter from satellite galaxies, but the role of dynamical friction in this process has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we present self-consistent N-body simulations that incorporate the effects of dynamical friction on the tidal formation of DF2, and compare them with the one without dynamical friction. We find that dynamical friction significantly accelerates the decay of the satellite galaxy's orbit, causing it to experience more frequent tidal stripping and leading to the earlier formation of a DM-deficient state, approximately 7-8 Gyr after infall. This is a few Gyr earlier than simulations without dynamical friction. Our results suggest that DMDGs can form in a wider range of orbital configurations, particularly on more circular orbits, than previously thought. Furthermore, we find that globular clusters in the DM-deficient phase exhibit elevated velocity dispersion, providing an observational signature of this evolutionary stage. We also examine the evolution of satellite in the phase space of total energy versus angular momentum, and show that a vertically narrow feature in this phase space is a clear signature of pericentre passage. These findings broaden the understanding of how DMDGs form and highlight the critical role of dynamical friction in shaping the evolutionary history of satellite galaxies in massive halos.</description>

      <title>How the Galaxy-Halo Connection Depends on Large-Scale Environment</title>

Abstract: We investigate the connection between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale environments at $z=0$ with Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation data. We predict stellar masses from subhalo properties to test two types of machine learning (ML) models: Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) with simple galaxy environment features and $\mathbb{E}(3)$-invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). The best-performing EBM models leverage spherically averaged overdensity features on $3$ Mpc scales. Interpretations via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) also suggest that, in the context of the TNG300 galaxy-halo connection, simple spherical overdensity on $\sim 3$ Mpc scales is more important than cosmic web distance features measured using the DisPerSE algorithm. Meanwhile, a GNN with connectivity defined by a fixed linking length, $L$, outperforms the EBM models by a significant margin. As we increase the linking length scale, GNNs learn important environmental contributions up to the largest scales we probe ($L=10$ Mpc). We conclude that $3$ Mpc distance scales are most critical for describing the TNG galaxy-halo connection using the spherical overdensity parameterization but that information on larger scales, which is not captured by simple environmental parameters or cosmic web features, can further augment these models. Our study highlights the benefits of using interpretable ML algorithms to explain models of astrophysical phenomena, and the power of using GNNs to flexibly learn complex relationships directly from data while imposing constraints from physical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $&lt;= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its host, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.</description>
