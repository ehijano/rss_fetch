      <title>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Prediction of Tensor Material Properties of Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning methods applied to the material sciences have often predicted invariant, scalar properties of material systems to great effect. Newer, coordinate equivariant models promise to provide a coordinate system dependent output in a well defined manner, but recent applications often neglect a direct prediction of directional (i.e. coordinate system dependent) quantities and instead are used to predict still just invariant quantities. This component-wise prediction of tensorial properties is achieved by decomposing tensors into harmonic subspaces via a \textit{tensor spherical harmonic decomposition}, by which we may also associate arbitrary tensors with the irreducible representations of the rotation group. This essentially allows us to read off tensors component-wise from the output representations of these equivariant models. In this work, we present results for the prediction of various material property tensors directly from crystalline structures. Namely, given some material's crystalline structure, we may predict tensor components of dielectric, piezoelectric, and elasticity tensors directly from the output of a $SE(3)$ equivariant model.</description>

      <title>Large-scale semi-discrete optimal transport with distributed Voronoi diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, I propose a numerical method to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems for gigantic pointsets ($10^8$ points and more). By pushing the limits by several orders of magnitude, it opens the path to new applications in cosmology, fluid simulation and data science to name but a few. The method is based on a new algorithm that computes (generalized) Voronoi diagrams in parallel and in a distributed way. First I make the simple observation that the cells defined by a subgraph of the Delaunay graph contain the Voronoi cells, and that one can deduce the missing edges from the intersections between those cells. Based on this observation, I introduce the Distributed Voronoi Diagram algorithm (DVD) that can be used on a cluster and that exchanges vertices between the nodes as need be. I also report early experimental results, demonstrating that the DVD algorithm has the potential to solve some giga-scale semi-discrete optimal transport problems encountered in computational cosmology.</description>

      <title>Neural force functional for non-equilibrium many-body colloidal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine power functional theory and machine learning to study non-equilibrium overdamped many-body systems of colloidal particles at the level of one-body fields. We first sample in steady state the one-body fields relevant for the dynamics from computer simulations of Brownian particles under the influence of randomly generated external fields. A neural network is then trained with this data to represent locally in space the formally exact functional mapping from the one-body density and velocity profiles to the one-body internal force field. The trained network is used to analyse the non-equilibrium superadiabatic force field and the transport coefficients such as shear and bulk viscosities. Due to the local learning approach, the network can be applied to systems much larger than the original simulation box in which the one-body fields are sampled. Complemented with the exact non-equilibrium one-body force balance equation and a continuity equation, the network yields viable predictions of the dynamics in time-dependent situations. Even though training is based on steady states only, the predicted dynamics is in good agreement with simulation results. A neural dynamical density functional theory can be straightforwardly implemented as a limiting case in which the internal force field is that of an equilibrium system. The framework is general and directly applicable to other many-body systems of interacting particles following Brownian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Increasing the detectability of long-period and nulling pulsars in next-generation pulsar surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of multiple long-period pulsars (periods ${\sim}10\,$s or larger) are starting to challenge the conventional notion that coherent radio emission cannot be produced by objects that are below the many theorised death lines. Many of the past pulsar surveys and software have been prone to selection effects that restricted their sensitivities towards long-period and sporadically-emitting objects. Pulsar surveys using new-generation low-frequency facilities are starting to employ longer dwell times, which makes them significantly more sensitive in detecting long-period or nulling pulsars. There have also been software advancements to aid more sensitive searches towards long-period objects. Furthermore, recent discoveries suggest that nulling may be a key aspect of the long-period pulsar population. We simulate both long-period and nulling pulsar signals, using the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter (SMART) survey data as reference, and explore the detection efficacy of popular search methods such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), fast-folding algorithm (FFA) and single pulse search (SPS). For FFT-based search and SPS, we make use of the PRESTO implementation, and for FFA we use RIPTIDE. We find RIPTIDE's FFA to be more sensitive; however, it is also the slowest algorithm. PRESTO's FFT, although faster than others, also shows some unexpected inaccuracies in detection properties. SPS is highly sensitive to long-period and nulling signals, but only for pulses with high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratios. We use these findings to inform current and future pulsar surveys that aim to uncover a large population of long-period or nulling objects and comment on how to make optimal use of these methods in unison.</description>

      <title>Strong-field effects in the photo-induced dissociation of the hydrogen molecule on a silver nanoshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic catalysis is a rapidly growing field of research, both from experimental and computational perspectives. Experimental observations demonstrate an enhanced dissociation rate for molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles under low-intensity visible light. The hot-carrier transfer from the nanoparticle to the molecule is often claimed as the mechanism for dissociation. However, the charge transfer time scale is on the order of few femtoseconds and cannot be resolved experimentally. In this situation, ab initio non-adiabatic calculations can provide a solution. Such simulations, however, have their own limitations related to the computational cost. To accelerate plasmonic catalysis simulations, many researchers resort to applying high-intensity external fields to nanoparticle-molecule systems. Here, we show why such an approach can be problematic and emphasize the importance of considering strong-field effects when interpreting the results of time-dependent density functional theory simulations of plasmonic catalysis. By studying the hydrogen molecule dissociation on the surface of a silver nanoshell and analyzing the electron transfer at different field frequencies and intensities, we demonstrate that the molecule dissociates due to multiphoton absorption and subsequent ionization.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields: A Framework for Solving Time-dependent Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Evolution of current-carrying string networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic string networks are expected to form in early Universe phase transitions via the Kibble mechanism and are unavoidable in several Beyond the Standard Model theories. While most predictions of observational signals of string networks assume featureless Abelian-Higgs or Nambu-Goto string networks, in many such extensions the networks can carry additional degrees of freedom, including charges and currents; these are often generically known as superconducting strings. All such degrees of freedom can impact the evolution of the networks and therefore their observational signatures. We report on the results of $2048^3$ field theory simulations of the evolution of a current-carrying network of strings, highlighting the different scaling behaviours of the network in the radiation and matter eras. We also report the first numerical measurements of the coherence length scales for the charge and current and of the condensate equation of state, and show that the latter mainly depends on the expansion rate, with chirality occurring for the matter era. Qualitatively, the fact that the matter era is the optimal expansion rate for these networks to reach scaling is in agreement with recent analytic modeling.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Monte Carlo Simulation of Superfluid Ring Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to lay the groundwork to construct and characterize a quantum device; which we refer to as a superfluid ring lattice; that could serve as a multi-qubit system in the future. Accordingly, a mathematical framework, called the Integer Lattice Method (ILM), is exploited to construct a two-dimensional optical landscape which could facilitate a superfluid ring qubit. The Integer Lattice Method allows one to design and explore both periodic and quasi-periodic structured coherent wave interference patterns. Furthermore, the formalism allows for a direct link to experimental realization. The lattices obtained from ILM can be investigated using WA-PIMC. In particular, the spatial and superfluid density at equilibrium are observables of interest to obtain our objective.
  In this thesis, the ab-initio Path Integral Monte Carlo Worm algorithm is implemented with the future aim of investigating the construction of superfluid ring lattices. It is written in independent and interchangeable modules in the novel programming language Julia. To ensure scalability, a custom nearest-neighbour algorithm is added. The simulation software is benchmarked by comparing it with exact analytical results from the non-interacting Bose gas model. Emerging issues with our implementation of the Worm algorithm are identified and thoroughly investigated. Finally, some preliminary results on the equilibrium density distribution of the found ILM lattices are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Gaining Cross-Platform Parallelism for HAL's Molecular Dynamics Package using SYCL</title>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are one of the methods in scientific computing that benefit from GPU acceleration. For those devices, SYCL is a promising API for writing portable codes. In this paper, we present the case study of "HAL's MD package" that has been successfully migrated from CUDA to SYCL. We describe the different strategies that we followed in the process of porting the code. Following these strategies, we achieved code portability across major GPU vendors. Depending on the actual kernels, both significant performance improvements and regressions are observed. As a side effect of the migration process, we obtained impressing speedups also for execution on CPUs.</description>

      <title>Early-time resonances in the three-dimensional wall-bounded axisymmetric Euler and related equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complex-time analytic structure of solutions of the 3D-axisymmetric, wall-bounded, incompressible Euler equations, by starting with the initial data proposed in Luo and Hou (2014), to study a possible finite-time singularity. We use our pseudospectral Fourier-Chebyshev method, with quadruple-precision arithmetic, to compute the time-Taylor series coefficients of the flow fields, up to a high order. We show that the resulting approximations display early-time resonances; the initial spatial location of these structures is different from that for the tygers, which we have obtained in Kolluru et al. (2022). We then perform asymptotic analysis of the Taylor-series coefficients, by using generalised ratio methods, to extract the location and nature of the convergence-limiting singularities and demonstrate that these singularities are distributed around the origin, in the complex-t2 plane, along two curves that resemble the shape of an eye. We obtain similar results for the 1D wall-approximation (of the full 3D-axisymmetric Euler equation) called the 1D HL model, for which we use Fourier-pseudospectral methods to compute the time-Taylor series coefficients of the flow fields. Our work examines the link between tygers, in Galerkin-truncated pseudospectral studies, and early-time resonances, in truncated time-Taylor expansions of solutions of PDEs, such as those we consider.</description>

      <title>High-precision and low-depth eigenstate property estimation: theory and resource estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the eigenstate properties of quantum many-body systems is a long-standing, challenging problem for both classical and quantum computing. For the task of eigenstate preparation, quantum signal processing (QSP) has established near-optimal query complexity $O( \Delta^{-1} \log(\epsilon^{-1}) )$ by querying the block encoding of the Hamiltonian $H$ where $\Delta$ is the energy gap and $\epsilon$ is the target precision. However, QSP is challenging for both near-term noisy quantum computers and early fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC), which are limited by the number of logical qubits and circuit depth. To date, early FTQC algorithms have focused on querying the perfect time evolution $e^{-iHt}$. It remains uncertain whether early FTQC algorithms can maintain good asymptotic scaling at the gate level. Moreover, when considering qubit connectivity, the circuit depth of existing FTQC algorithms may scale suboptimally with system size. Here, we present a full-stack design of a random sampling algorithm for estimating the eigenenergy and the observable expectations on the eigenstates, which can achieve high precision and good system size scaling. The gate complexity has a logarithmic dependence on precision $ {O}(\log^{1+o(1)} (1/\epsilon))$ for generic Hamiltonians, which cannot achieved by methods using Trottersiation to realise $e^{-iHt}$ like in QETU. For $n$-qubit lattice Hamiltonians, our method achieves near-optimal system size dependence with the gate complexity $O(n^{1+o(1)})$. When restricting the qubit connectivity to a linear nearest-neighbour architecture, The method shows advantages in circuit depth, with $O(n^{o(1)})$ for lattice models and $O(n^{2+o(1)})$ for electronic structure problems. We compare the resource requirements (CNOT gates, T gates and qubit numbers) by phase estimation, QSP, and QETU, in lattice and molecular problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectral scheme for atomic structure calculations in pseudopotential Kohn-Sham density functional theory. In particular, after applying an exponential transformation of the radial coordinates, we employ global polynomial interpolation on a Chebyshev grid, with derivative operators approximated using the Chebyshev differentiation matrix, and integrations using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme through spin-polarized and unpolarized calculations for representative atoms, while considering local, semilocal, and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. In particular, we find that $\mathcal{O}$(200) grid points are sufficient to achieve an accuracy of 1 microhartree in the eigenvalues for optimized norm conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials spanning the periodic table from atomic number $Z = 1$ to $83$.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of peristaltic flows in piezoelectric porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a new type of weakly nonlinear two-scale model of controllable periodic porous piezoelectric structures saturated by Newtonian fluids. The flow is propelled by peristaltic deformation of microchannels which is induced due to piezoelectric segments embedded in the microstructure and locally actuated by voltage waves. The homogenization is employed to derive a macroscopic model of the poroelastic medium with effective parameters modified by piezoelectric properties of the skeleton. To capture the peristaltic pumping, the nonlinearity associated with deforming configuration must be respected. In the macroscopic model, this nonlinearity is introduced through homogenized coefficients depending on the deforming micro-configurations. For this, linear expansions based on the sensitivity analysis of the homogenized coefficients with respect to deformation induced by the macroscopic quantities are employed. This enables to avoid the two-scale tight coupling of the macro- and microproblems otherwise needed in nonlinear problems. The derived reduced-order model is implemented and verified using direct numerical simulations of the periodic heterogeneous medium. Numerical results demonstrate the peristaltic driven fluid propulsion in response to the electric actuation and the efficiency of the proposed treatment of the nonlinearity. The paper shows new perspectives in homogenization-based computationally efficient modelling of weakly nonlinear problems where continuum microstructures are perturbed by coupled fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations based on the HHL algorithm with a novel qudits methodology, a generalization of the qubits with more states, to reduce the number of gates to be applied and the amount of resources. Based on this idea, we perform a quantum-inspired version on tensor networks, taking advantage of their ability to perform non-unitary operations such as projection. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a simulation as efficient as possible of the HHL algorithm in order to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. Finally, we use this algorithm to obtain a solution for the harmonic oscillator with an external force, the forced damped oscillator and the 2D static heat equation differential equations.</description>

Abstract: Circuit cutting, the partitioning of quantum circuits into smaller independent fragments, has become a promising avenue for scaling up current quantum-computing experiments. Here, we introduce a scheme for joint cutting of two-qubit rotation gates based on a virtual gate-teleportation protocol. By that, we significantly lower the previous upper bounds on the sampling overhead and prove optimality of the scheme. Furthermore, we show that no classical communication between the circuit partitions is required. For parallel two-qubit rotation gates we derive an optimal ancilla-free decomposition, which include CNOT gates as a special case.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and composite excitations of antiferromagnetic quantum spin trimer chains in a magnetic field</title>

Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies on the high-energy excitations, we theoretically explore the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics of the antiferromagnetic trimer chains in a magnetic field using the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle and cluster perturbation theory. We measure the entanglement entropy to uncover the phase diagram, encompassing the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II and ferromagnetic phases. Both critical XY-I and XY-II phases are both described by the conformal field theory with the central charge $c \simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime of weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as the internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagation of doublon and quarton, respectively. Notably, the application of a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectra into two branches labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we also explore the spin dynamics of a trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}, and discuss the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation. Our results can be verified in the inelastic neutron scattering experiments and provide deep insights for exploring the high-energy exotic excitations.</description>

      <title>Neural canonical transformations for vibrational spectra of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of polyatomic molecules around their equilibrium positions can be regarded as quantum coupled anharmonic oscillators. Solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equations can interpret or predict experimental spectra of molecules. In this study, we develop a novel approach to solve excited states of anharmonic vibrational systems. The normal coordinates of molecules are transformed into new coordinates through a normalizing flow parameterized by a neural network, facilitating the construction of a set of orthogonal many-body variational wavefunctions. Our methodology has been validated on an exactly solvable $64$-dimensional coupled harmonic oscillator, yielding numerical results with a relative error on the order of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, the neural canonical transformations are also applied to calculate the energy levels of two specific molecules, acetonitrile ($\text{C}\text{H}_3\text{CN}$) and ethylene oxide ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{O}$) involving $12$ and $15$ vibrational modes respectively, which are in agreement with experimental findings. One of the key advantages of our approach is its flexibility concerning the potential energy surface, requiring no specific form for its application. Moreover, this method can be easily implemented on large-scale distributed computing platforms, making it particularly suitable for investigating more complex vibrational structures.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08122</link>

Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875</link>

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>
