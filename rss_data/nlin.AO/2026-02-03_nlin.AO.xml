      <title>Intelligent Control of Transportation Flow in Physarum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Physarum network expands or retracts in response to environmental stimuli, demonstrating an intelligent adaptive capability to locate optimal paths for nutrient transport. The underlying physical mechanism governing this intelligence behavior remains an unresolved problem in biological physics.unlike the unidirectional flow typical of urban traffic networks, cytoplasmic flow within the Physarum network exhibits periodic oscillations modulated by biological repellents and attractants. In this study, we investigate how local flows within the networks branch channels interact to collectively govern the global oscillatory dynamics.We find that the measured flow fluxes at intersection nodes obey Kirchhoff's current law. Phase differences exist among the flows in different branches.At the microscopic scale, flow distribution exhibits only brief periods of traffic congestion, which are resolved by the oscillatory flows. By mapping the flow flux vectors onto the magnetic moment vector of spin ice model, we demonstrate that the flow vectors strictly obey the ice-rule of vertex models in statistical physics.Notably, the three branches converging at a Y-shaped node never become blocked simultaneously, thereby preventing traffic congestion and ensuring efficient transmission of nutrients and signals.This intelligent flow control phenomenon offers novel insights for addressing traffic congestion and advances our understanding of frustrated quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Memory effects govern scale-free dynamics beyond universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale-invariant avalanches -- with events of all sizes following power-law distributions -- are considered critical. Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics. In two and three dimensions, spatial constraints yield smaller yet robust exponent values governed by universality classes. However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Patterns in Conflict Dynamics in Yemen and Syria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conflict fatalities tend to follow heavy-tailed statistical distributions. A 2005 fusion-fission theory predicts mathematically that for armed groups operating in dynamically evolving clusters within a given conflict, the number of fatalities per conflict event will follow an approximate power-law distribution with exponent near 2.5, with the specific exponent value offering insight into the relative robustness of larger versus smaller clusters of fighters in that armed group. Since Yemen and Syria are current hotspots for future conflict, yet their most recent conflicts (2023-2025) have not been studied at the event level, we use ACLED data to determine their best-fit exponent value as each conflict evolved. We find that the exponent lies between 2.5 and 3.5 predominantly throughout each conflict, which suggests that the fighters in each of these conflicts continued to operate in smaller clusters as the conflict evolved. Moreover, temporary reductions in the exponent value -- which suggests a temporary increase in the robustness and involvement of larger clusters of fighters -- appear to arise during major crises ahead of the largest battles. Though the lack higher-quality data for these conflicts prevents us from establishing this more firmly, such a temporary reduction in the exponent value hints at its potential use as an early-warning signature.</description>

      <title>When higher-order interactions enhance synchronization: the case of the Kuramoto model on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through a numerical study of higher-order Kuramoto models on random hypergraphs, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it when combined with pairwise ones. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</description>
