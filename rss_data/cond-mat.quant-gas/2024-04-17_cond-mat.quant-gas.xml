      <title>Rotational Superradiance in a Time-Reversal Symmetry-Broken Quantum Gas inside an Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Appearance of quantized vortices in a superfluid and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stems from their nontrivial response to broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Here we show that breaking of the TRS by, for example, rotation or an external synthetic magnetic field in a transversely-driven BEC coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity modifies drastically Dicke-superradiance and self-ordering phenomena in this system. In particular, photon scattering from the pump laser into the cavity is amplified by the rotational motion of the BEC, leading to so-called 'rotational superradiance' - in a loose analogy to black-hole physics - with distinct critical scaling properties. Another notable finding is that cavity photons mediate long-range, periodic attractive interactions among the vortices, which compete with pair-wise logarithmic repulsive vortex interactions and deform the Abrikosov triangular vortex lattice favoring a stripe-like pattern. Remarkably, the rotation of the BEC and topological properties of the vortex lattice can be monitored nondestructively through the cavity output field.</description>

      <title>Measuring bipartite spin correlations of lattice-trapped dipolar atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a bipartition technique using a super-lattice architecture to access correlations between alternating planes of a mesoscopic array of spin-3 chromium atoms trapped in a 3D optical lattice. Using this method, we observe that out-of-equilibrium dynamics driven by long-range dipolar interactions lead to spin anti-correlations between the two spatially separated subsystems. Our bipartite measurements reveal a subtle interplay between the anisotropy of the 3D dipolar interactions and that of the lattice structure, without requiring single-site addressing. We compare our results to theoretical predictions based on a truncated cumulant expansion and a new cluster semi-classical method that we use to investigate correlations at the microscopic scale. Comparison with a high-temperature analytical model reveals quantum thermalization at a high negative spin temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum effective dynamics of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics described by the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra. Our formulation of the effective theory is based in the standard procedure in conformal field theory, in which the Hilbert space is completely known a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the sym- metry algebra, and not by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian. For the purposes of comparison with alternative effective theories based on quantum hydrodynamics, we consider one chirality and study the hamiltonian equation of motion of the density field, which is shown to obey the quantum Benjamin- Ono equation, in agreement with previous hydrodynamic results. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. We consider this result to be a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoric and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <title>Berry-dipole Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ''Berry-dipole semimetals'', whose band degeneracies are characterized by quantized Berry dipoles. Through a two-band model constructed by Hopf map, we reveal that the Berry-dipole semimetals display a multitude of salient properties distinct from other topological semimetals. On the boundary, we find that the first-order Berry-dipole semimetal harbors anomalous paired Fermi arcs with the same spin polarization, even though the layer Chern number is zero, and the second-order Berry-dipole semimetal hosts dispersionless hinge arcs. In the bulk, we find that the low-energy Berry-dipole Hamiltonian near the band node has a quadratic energy dispersion and peculiar Berry curvature, which give rise to rather unique characteristics in the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, orbital magnetization and Landau levels. Our study shows that Berry-dipole semimetals are a class of topological gapless phases supporting rich intriguing physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a confining ring potential with a Gaussian profile. By introducing a rotating sinusoidal perturbation, we numerically highlight the nucleation of quantum vortices in a particular regime throughout the dynamics. Numerical computations are made via a Strang splitting time integration and a two-point flux approximation Finite Volume scheme based on a particular admissible triangulation. We also develop numerical algorithms for vortex tracking adapted to our finite volume framework.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic polarizability of Dy at 532 nm on the intercombination transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental measurements of the dynamical polarizability of dysprosium, at a wavelength of 532 nm. We measure all three components (scalar, vector, tensor) of the anisotropic polarizability for the ground and the excited manifolds of the intercombination transition of Dy at 626 nm. The apparatus on which the measurements are performed is first presented. We obtain with this setup imaging of single Dy atoms with fidelity above 99 % and losses below 2.5 % induced by imaging. We then describe the methods used to extract the polarizability. In particular, we combine a measurement of trap frequency and trap depth on single atoms in optical tweezers, allowing us to obtain a measurement of the ground state polarizability free of errors in trap waist calibration. The obtained values give a magic condition between two Zeeman states in the ground and excited manifolds, which was used to image single atoms in optical tweezer arrays. The scalar polarizability of the ground state is in disagreement with theoretical expectations, calling for future investigations to resolve the discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structure factor and a new method to measure the pairing gap in two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By calculating the dynamical structure factor along the high symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone, the dynamical excitations of attractive Fermi-Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square optical lattice are studied with random phase approximation. {Two kinds of collective modes are investigated, including a Goldstone phonon mode at transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The phonon origins from the spontaneously U(1) symmetry breaking of pairing gap, and its speed is suppressed by the interaction strength. The collective roton mode origins from the breaking of a global pseudospin SU(2) symmetry.} Dynamical excitations at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$ consist of a sharp roton molecular peak in the low-energy region and a broad atomic excitation band in the higher energy region. Furthermore, the weight of the roton molecular peak decreases monotonically with increasing the hopping strength, while the weight of the atomic excitations increases quickly. Interestingly we check that the area covered by the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which is also true in the system with spin-orbit coupling. This conclusion paves a potential way to measure the pairing gap of lattice system experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</description>

      <title>Frustrated extended Bose-Hubbard model and deconfined quantum critical points with optical lattices at the anti-magic wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of geometrically frustrated many-body quantum systems is of central importance to uncover novel quantum mechanical effects. We design a scheme where ultracold bosons trapped in a one-dimensional state-dependent optical lattice are modeled by a frustrated Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. A derivation of the Hamiltonian parameters based on Cesium atoms, further show large tunability of contact and nearest-neighbour interactions. For pure contact repulsion, we discover the presence of two phases peculiar to frustrated quantum magnets: the bond-order-wave insulator with broken inversion symmetry and a chiral superfluid. When the nearest-neighbour repulsion becomes sizeable, a further density-wave insulator with broken translational symmetry can appear. We show that the phase transition between the two spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases is continuous, thus representing a one-dimensional deconfined quantum critical point not captured by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. Our results provide a solid ground to unveil the novel quantum physics induced by the interplay of non-local interactions, geometrical frustration, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Breathing mode of a quantum droplet in a quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the breathing mode and the stability of a quantum droplet in a tightly trapped one-dimensional dipolar gas of bosonic atoms. When the droplet with a flat-top density profile is formed, the breathing mode frequency scales as the inverse of the number of atoms in the cloud. This is straightforwardly derived within a phenomenological hydrodynamical approach and confirmed using both a variational method based on a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii action functional and the sum-rule approach. We extend our analysis also to the presence of axial confinement showing the effect of the trap on the density profile and therefore on the breathing mode frequency scaling. Our analysis confirms the stability of the quantum droplet against the particles emission when the flat-top density profile is observed. Our results can be used as a guide to the experimental investigations of collective modes to detect the formation of quantum droplets in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar gases.</description>

      <title>Temperature-induced miscibility of impurities in trapped Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermal properties of impurities embedded in a repulsive Bose gas under a harmonic trapping potential. In order to obtain exact structural properties in this inhomogeneous many-body system, we resort to the path-integral Monte Carlo method. We find that, at low temperatures, a single impurity is expelled to the edges of the bath cloud if the impurity-boson coupling constant is larger than the boson-boson one. However, when the temperature is increased, but still in the Bose-condensed phase, the impurity occupies the core of the trap and, thus, the system becomes miscible. This thermal-induced miscibility transition is also observed for a finite concentration of impurities in this inhomogeneous system. We find that the transition temperature for miscibility depends on the impurity-boson interaction and we indicate a novel nondestructive method to measure the temperature of a system based on the studied phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations in a quasi-periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling are ubiquitous phenomena which are sustained by a band-gap spectrum of a periodic Hamiltonian and can be observed in dynamics of a quantum particle or a wavepacket in a periodic potential under action of a linear force. Such physical setting remains meaningful for aperiodic potentials too, although band-gap structure does not exist anymore. Here we consider the dynamics of noninteracting atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in a quasi-periodic one-dimensional optical lattice subjected to a weak linear force. Excited states with energies below the mobility edge, and thus localized in space, are considered. We show that the observed oscillatory behavior is enabled by tunneling between the initial state and a state (or several states) located nearby in the coordinate-energy space. The states involved in such Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations are determined by the selection rule consisting of the condition of their spatial proximity and condition of quasi-resonances occurring at avoided crossings of the energy levels. The latter condition is formulated mathematically using the Gershgorin circle theorem. The effect of the inter-atomic interactions on the dynamics can also be predicted on the bases of the developed theory. The reported results can be observed in any physical system allowing for observation of the Bloch oscillations, upon introducing incommensurablity in the governing Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Stability of fractional Chern insulators with a non-Landau level continuum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.08 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. It is suggested that HQDL has relevance to the non-superfluid states of confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems which are semi-Boltzmann-like owing to the suppression of Bosonic correlation.</description>
