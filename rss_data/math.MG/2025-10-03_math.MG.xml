      <title>Trace and Extension Theorems for Besov Functions in Doubling Metric Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of a non-complete doubling metric measure space $(\Omega,d,\mu)$, we construct various bounded linear trace and extension operators for homogeneous and inhomogeneous Besov spaces $B^\alpha_{p,q}$. Equipping the boundary $\partial\Omega:=\overline\Omega\setminus\Omega$ with a measure which is codimension $\theta$ Ahlfors regular with respect to $\mu$, these operators take the form
  \[
  T:B^\alpha_{p,q}(\Omega)\to B^{\alpha-\theta/p}_{p,q}(\partial\Omega),\quad E:B^\alpha_{p,q}(\partial\Omega)\to B^{\alpha+\theta/p}_{p,q}(\Omega).
  \] The trace operators are first constructed under the additional assumption that $\Omega$ is a uniform domain in its completion. We then use such results along with the technique of hyperbolic filling to remove this assumption in the case that $\Omega$ is bounded. This extends to the doubling setting some earlier results of Marcos and Saksman-Soto proven under the assumption that the ambient measure is Ahlfors regular.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity one RCD-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces $(X,d,\mathfrak{m})$ with group actions by isometries preserving the reference measure $\mathfrak{m}$ and whose orbit space has dimension one, i.e. cohomogeneity one actions. To this end we prove a Slice Theorem asserting that when $X$ is non-collapsed the slices are homeomorphic to metric cones over homogeneous spaces with $\mathrm{Ric} \geq 0$. As a consequence we obtain complete topological structural results (also in the collapsed case) and a regular orbit representation theorem. Conversely, we show how to construct new $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces from a cohomogeneity one group diagram, giving a complete description of $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of cohomogeneity one. As an application of these results we obtain the classification of cohomogeneity one, non-collapsed $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of essential dimension at most $4$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of metric spaces with a metric fundamental class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider three conditions on metric manifolds with finite volume: (1) the existence of a metric fundamental class, (2) local index bounds for Lipschitz maps, and (3) Gromov--Hausdorff approximation with volume control by bi-Lipschitz manifolds. Condition (1) is known for metric manifolds satisfying the LLC condition by work of Basso--Marti--Wenger, while (3) is known for metric surfaces by work of Ntalampekos--Romney.
  We prove that for metric manifolds with finite Nagata dimension, all three conditions are equivalent and that without assuming finite Nagata dimension, (1) implies (2) and (3) implies (1). As a corollary we obtain a generalization of the approximation result of Ntalampekos--Romney to metric manifolds of dimension $n\ge 2$, which have the LLC property and finite Nagata dimension.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of the Hat and Spectre tilings and some of their relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffraction spectra of the Hat and Spectre monotile tilings, which are known to be pure point, are derived and computed explicitly. This is done via model set representatives of self-similar members in the topological conjugacy classes of the Hat and the Spectre tiling, which are the CAP and the CASPr tiling, respectively. This is followed by suitable reprojections of the model sets to represent the original Hat and Spectre tilings, which also allows to calculate their Fourier--Bohr coefficients explicitly. Since the windows of the underlying model sets have fractal boundaries, these coefficients need to be computed via an exact renormalisation cocycle in internal space.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>

      <title>Forbidden induced subgraphs for graphs and signed graphs with eigenvalues bounded from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The smallest eigenvalue of a graph is the smallest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. We show that the family of graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-\lambda$ can be defined by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs if and only if $\lambda &lt; \lambda^*$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, and $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. This resolves a question raised by Bussemaker and Neumaier. As a byproduct, we find all the limit points of smallest eigenvalues of graphs, supplementing Hoffman's work on those limit points in $[-2, \infty)$.
  We also prove that the same conclusion about forbidden subgraph characterization holds for signed graphs. Our impetus for the study of signed graphs is to determine the maximum cardinality of a spherical two-distance set with two fixed angles (one acute and one obtuse) in high dimensions. Denote by $N_{\alpha, \beta}(n)$ the maximum number of unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where all pairwise inner products lie in $\{\alpha, \beta\}$ with $-1 \le \beta &lt; 0 \le \alpha &lt; 1$. Very recently Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang and Zhao determined the limit of $N_{\alpha, \beta}(d)/d$ as $d\to\infty$ when $\alpha + 2\beta &lt; 0$ or $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha-\beta) \in \{1,\sqrt2,\sqrt3\}$, and they proposed a conjecture on the limit in terms of eigenvalue multiplicities of signed graphs. We establish their conjecture whenever $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha - \beta) &lt; \lambda^*$.</description>

      <title>Planar tropical caustics: trivalency and convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if a graph $G$ admits a quasi-isometry $\phi$ to a graph $H$ of bounded path-width, then we can assign a non-negative integer length to each edge of $H$, such that the same function $\phi$ is a quasi-isometry to this weighted version of $H$, with error only an additive constant.</description>
