      <title>Optimal Inference of Asynchronous Boolean Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associations between phenotype and genomic and epigenomic markers are often derived by correlation. Systems Biology aims to make more robust connections and uncover broader insights by modeling the cellular mechanisms that produce a phenotype. The question of choosing the modeling methodology is of central importance. A model that does not capture biological reality closely enough will not explain the system's behavior. At the same time, highly detailed models suffer from computational limitations and are likely to overfit the data. Boolean networks strike a balance between complexity and descriptiveness and thus have received increasing interest. We previously described an algorithm for fitting Boolean networks to high-throughout experimental data that finds the optimal network with respect to the information in a given dataset. In this work, we describe a simple extension that enables the modeling of asynchronous dynamics, i.e. different reaction times for different network nodes. Our approach greatly simplifies the construction of Boolean network models for time-series datasets, where asynchronicty often occurs. We demonstrate our methodology by integrating real data from three datasets, and provide an implementation that can be used by the community for network reconstruction using any high-throughout dataset. Our approach significantly expands the applicability of the Boolean network model to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Constraint-Based Bayesian Structure Learning Algorithms: Role of Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the associations between real world entities from their multivariate cross-sectional profiles can provide cues into the concerted working of these entities as a system. Several techniques have been proposed for deciphering these associations including constraint-based Bayesian structure learning (BSL) algorithms that model them as directed acyclic graphs. Benchmarking these algorithms have typically focused on assessing the variation in performance measures such as sensitivity as a function of the dimensionality represented by the number of nodes in the DAG, and sample size. The present study elucidates the importance of network topology in benchmarking exercises. More specifically, it investigates variations in sensitivity across distinct network topologies while constraining the nodes, edges, and sample-size to be identical, eliminating these as potential confounders. Sensitivity of three popular constraint-based BSL algorithms (Peter-Clarke, Grow-Shrink, Incremental Association Markov Blanket) in learning the network structure from multivariate cross-sectional profiles sampled from network models with sub-linear, linear, and super-linear DAG topologies generated using preferential attachment is investigated. Results across linear and nonlinear models revealed statistically significant $(\alpha=0.05)$ decrease in sensitivity estimates from sub-linear to super-linear topology constitutively across the three algorithms. These results are demonstrated on networks with nodes $(N_{nods}=48,64)$, noise strengths $(\sigma =3,6)$ and sample size $(N = 2^{10})$. The findings elucidate the importance of accommodating the network topology in constraint-based BSL benchmarking exercises.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Numerous methods have been proposed to infer a directed acyclic graph (DAG) corresponding to the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) that captures causal gene relationships. However, existing models have restrictive assumptions (e.g. linearity, acyclicity), limited scalability, and/or fail to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</description>

      <title>A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Life uses non-equilibrium mechanisms to create ordered structures not attainable at equilibrium; the resulting order is assumed to provide functional benefits that outweigh costs of time and energy needed by these mechanisms. Here, we show that models of DNA replication and self-assembly, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve error correcting mechanisms like kinetic proofreading and dynamic instability through selection for fast replication alone. We abstract these results into a general framework that predicts a counterintuitive ''order through speed'' effect if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. We test our results against recent mutational screens of proofreading polymerases. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can evolve even before that order is directly functional, with consequences for the evolution of mutation rates, viral capsid assembly, and the origin of life.</description>
