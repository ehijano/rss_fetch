      <title>Localized evaluation and fast summation in the extrapolated regularization method for integrals in Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary integral equation methods are widely used in the solution of many partial differential equations. The kernels that appear in these surface integrals are nearly singular when evaluated near the boundary, and straightforward numerical integration produces inaccurate results. In Beale and Tlupova (Adv. Comput. Math, 2024), an extrapolated regularization method was proposed to accurately evaluate the nearly singular single and double-layer surface integrals for harmonic potentials or Stokes flow. The kernels are regularized using a smoothing parameter, and then a standard quadrature is applied. The integrals are computed for three choices of the smoothing parameter to find the extrapolated value to fifth order accuracy. In this work, we apply several techniques to reduce the computational cost of the extrapolated regularization method applied to the Stokes single and double layer integrals. First, we use a straightforward OpenMP parallelization over the target points. Second, we note that the effect of the regularization is local and evaluate only the local component of the sum for three values of the smoothing parameter. The non-local component of the sum is only evaluated once and reused in the other sums. This component is still the computational bottleneck as it is $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the system size. We apply the kernel-independent treecode to these far-field interactions to reduce the CPU time. We carry out experiments to determine optimal parameters both in terms of accuracy and efficiency of the computations. We then use these techniques to compute Stokes flow around two spheres that are nearly touching.</description>

      <title>An energy-stable parametric finite element method for Willmore flow with normal-tangential velocity splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an energy-stable fully discrete parametric approximation for Willmore flow of hypersurfaces in two and three space dimensions. We allow for the presence of spontaneous curvature effects and for open surfaces with boundary. The presented scheme is based on a new geometric partial differential equation (PDE) that combines an evolution equation for the mean curvature with a separate equation that prescribes the tangential velocity. The mean curvature is used to determine the normal velocity within the gradient flow structure, thus guaranteeing an unconditional energy stability for the discrete solution upon suitable discretization. We introduce a novel weak formulation for this geometric PDE, in which different types of boundary conditions can be naturally enforced. We further discretize the weak formulation to obtain a fully discrete parametric finite element method, for which well-posedness can be rigorously shown. Moreover, the constructed scheme admits an unconditional stability estimate in terms of the discrete energy. Extensive numerical experiments are reported to showcase the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method for computing Willmore flow of both curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Error Etimates for Non Conforming Discretisation of Time-dependent Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a generic framework, namely the gradient discretisation method (GDM), to propose a unified numerical analysis for general time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction models. We establish novel results for convergence rates of numerical approximations of such models under reasonable assumptions on exact solutions, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the approximate solution for suitably small time steps. The main interest of our results lies in covering several approximation methods and various applications of the considered model such as the generalised Burgers-Fisher (GBF) and the generalised Burgers-Huxley (GBH) models. Numerical tests based on the hybrid mimetic mixed (HMM) method for the GBF model are performed on various types of general meshes to examine the accuracy of the proposed gradient scheme. The results confirm our theoretical rates of convergence, even on mesh with extreme distortions.</description>

      <title>Minimal residual rational Krylov subspace method for sequences of shifted linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of sequences of shifted linear systems is a classic problem in numerical linear algebra, and a variety of efficient methods have been proposed over the years. Nevertheless, there still exist challenging scenarios witnessing a lack of performing solvers. For instance, state-of-the-art procedures struggle to handle nonsymmetric problems where the shifts are complex numbers that do not come as conjugate pairs. We design a novel projection strategy based on the rational Krylov subspace equipped with a minimal residual condition. We also devise a novel pole selection procedure, tailored to our problem, providing poles for the rational Krylov basis construction that yield faster convergence than those computed by available general-purpose schemes. A panel of diverse numerical experiments shows that our novel approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques, especially on the very challenging problems mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Automatic discovery of optimal meta-solvers for time-dependent nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general and scalable framework for the automated discovery of optimal meta-solvers for the solution of time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations after appropriate discretization. By integrating classical numerical methods (e.g., Krylov-based methods) with modern deep learning components, such as neural operators, our approach enables flexible, on-demand solver design tailored to specific problem classes and objectives. The fast solvers tackle the large linear system resulting from the Newton--Raphson iteration or by using an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration scheme. Specifically, we formulate solver discovery as a multi-objective optimization problem, balancing various performance criteria such as accuracy, speed, and memory usage. The resulting Pareto optimal set provides a principled foundation for solver selection based on user-defined preference functions. When applied to problems in reaction--diffusion, fluid dynamics, and solid mechanics, the discovered meta-solvers consistently outperform conventional iterative methods, demonstrating both practical efficiency and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Adaptive finite element convergence analysis of AT1 phase-field model for quasi-static fracture in strain-limiting solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research rigorously investigates the convergence of adaptive finite element methods for regularized variational models of quasi-static brittle fracture in elastic solids. We specifically examine a novel Ambrosio-Tortorelli (AT1) phase-field model within the framework of elasticity theories, particularly for material models characterized by an algebraically nonlinear stress-strain relationship. Two distinct and novel adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, underpinned by robust local error indicators, were introduced to efficiently solve the underlying nonlinear energy minimization problem. A detailed convergence analysis was conducted on the sequences of minimizers produced by these strategies. Our findings rigorously demonstrate that the minimizer sequences from the first adaptive algorithm achieve convergence to a predefined tolerance. Crucially, the second algorithm is proven to generate inherently convergent sequences, thereby eliminating the need for an explicit stopping criterion. The practical effectiveness of this proposed adaptive framework is thoroughly validated through extensive numerical simulations. A case study involving an edge crack in an elastic body, governed by an algebraically nonlinear strain-limiting relationship and subjected to anti-plane shear-type loading, is presented. Critical comparisons of the energy components-bulk, surface, and total-showcase the superior performance of both adaptive algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Fourier spectral approach to the spatial discretization of quasilinear hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the rigorous justification of the spatial discretization by means of Fourier spectral methods of quasilinear first-order hyperbolic systems. We provide uniform stability estimates that grant spectral convergence of the (spatially) semi-discretized solutions towards the corresponding continuous solution provided that the underlying system satisfies some suitable structural assumptions. We consider a setting with sharp low-pass filters and a setting with smooth low-pass filters and argue that - at least theoretically - smooth low-pass filters are operable on a larger class of systems. While our theoretical results are supported with numerical evidence, we also pinpoint some behavior of the numerical method that currently has no theoretical explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inverse-free dynamical system is proposed to solve the generalized absolute value equation (GAVE) within a fixed time, where the time of convergence is finite and is uniformly bounded for all initial points. Moreover, an iterative method obtained by using the forward-Euler discretization of the proposed dynamic model are developed and sufficient conditions which guarantee that the discrete iteration globally converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the unique solution of GAVE within a finite number of iterative steps are given.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric contact analysis in subsea umbilical and power cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsea umbilical and power cables contain a large number of contact interfaces between different geometries and materials. These complex interactions rise significant challenges for accurately considering contact surface properties by using traditional analytical solutions or finite element methods. These properties have been identified as the most sensitive parameters when performing the numerical simulation for stress analysis. Therefore, it is essential to apply a novel approach for contact analysis which improves the accuracy and efficiency for predicting contact properties. This paper presents an isogeometric analysis (IGA) approach addressing contact problems in dynamic umbilicals and power cables. Firstly, this isogeometric contact algorithm is formulated in MATLAB as a tool including the geometry description, contact detection and penalty function. Secondly, the contact interface between a steel tube and an outer sheath in an dynamic umbilical is established by this IGA contact algorithm and validated against that in ABAQUS for proving the accuracy and efficiency of IGA. Finally, the effects of element refinement, geometrical description, penalty factor on the accuracy, efficiency and stability of IGA are discussed.</description>

      <title>High order global flux schemes for general steady state preservation of shallow water moment equations with non-conservative products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow water moment equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that allow to represent vertical variations of the velocity profile at the expense of additional evolution equations for a number of additional variables, so called moments. This introduces non-linear non-conservative products in the system, which make the analytical characterization of steady states much harder if not impossible. The lack of analytical steady states poses a challenge for the design of well-balanced schemes, which aim at preserving such steady states as crucial in many applications. In this work, we present a family of fully well-balanced, high-order WENO finite volume methods for general hyperbolic balance laws with non-conservative products like the shallow water moment equations, for which no analytical steady states are available. The schemes are based on the flux globalization approach, in which both source terms and non-conservative products are integrated with a tailored high order quadrature in the divergence term. The resulting global flux is then reconstructed instead of the conservative variables to preserve all steady states. Numerical tests show the optimal convergence of the method and a significant error reduction for steady state solutions. Furthermore, we provide a numerical comparison of perturbed steady states for different families of shallow water moment equations, which illustrates the flexibility of our method that is valid for general equations without prior knowledge of steady states.</description>

      <title>Accelerating MPGP-type Methods Through Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the acceleration of MPGP-type algorithms using preconditioning for the solution of quadratic programming problems. The preconditioning needs to be done only on the free set so as not to change the constraints. A variant of preconditioning restricted to the free set is the preconditioning in face. The inner preconditioner in preconditioning in face needs to be recomputed or updated every time the free set changes. Here, we investigate an approximate variant of preconditioning in face that computes the inner preconditioner only once. We analyze the error of the approximate variant and provide numerical experiments demonstrating that very large speedups can be achieved by the approximate variant.</description>

      <title>Special measures of smoothness for approximation by sampling operators in $L_p(\Bbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional measures of smoothness often fail to provide accurate $L_p$-error estimates for approximation by sampling or interpolation operators, especially for functions with low smoothness. To address this issue, we introduce a modified measure of smoothness that incorporates the local behavior of a function at the sampling points through the use of averaged operators. With this new tool, we obtain matching direct and inverse error estimates for a wide class of sampling operators and functions in $L_p$ spaces. Additionally, we derive a criterion for the convergence of sampling operators in $L_p$, identify conditions that ensure the exact rate of approximation, construct realizations of $K$-functionals based on these operators, and study the smoothness properties of sampling operators. We also demonstrate how our results apply to several well-known operators, including the classical Whittaker-Shannon sampling operator, sampling operators generated by $B$-splines, and those based on the Gaussian.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scalar wave equation with power nonlinearity in n+1 dimensions. Unlike previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and do not assume any symmetries for n=3, and we only impose an SO(n-1) symmetry in higher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of Minkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time power-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for different spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and supercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Sectional Kolmogorov N-widths for parameter-dependent function spaces: A general framework with application to parametrized Friedrichs' systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate parametrized variational problems where for each parameter the solution may originate from a different parameter-dependent function space. Our main motivation is the theory of Friedrichs' systems, a large abstract class of linear PDE-problems whose solutions are sought in operator- (and thus parameter-)dependent graph spaces. Other applications include function spaces on parametrized domains or discretizations involving data-dependent stabilizers. Concerning the set of all parameter-dependent solutions, we argue that in these cases the interpretation as a "solution manifold" widely adopted in the model order reduction community is no longer applicable. Instead, we propose a novel framework based on the theory of fiber bundles and explain how established concepts such as approximability generalize by introducing a Sectional Kolmogorov N-width. Further, we prove exponential approximation rates of this N-width if a norm equivalence criterion is fulfilled. Applying this result to problems with Friedrichs' structure then gives a sufficient criterion that can be easily verified.</description>

      <title>Analysis of A Mixed Finite Element Method for Poisson's Equation with Rough Boundary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with finite element methods for Poisson's equation with rough boundary data. Conventional methods require that the boundary data $g$ of the problem belongs to $H^{1/2} (\partial \Omega)$. However, in many applications one has to consider the case when $g$ is in $L^2(\partial \Omega)$ only. To this end, very weak solutions are considered to establish the well-posedness of the problem. Most previously proposed numerical methods use regularizations of the boundary data. The main purpose of this paper is to use the Raviart--Thomas mixed finite element method to solve the Poisson equation with rough boundary data directly. We prove that the solution to the proposed mixed method converges to the very weak solution. In particular, we prove that the convergence rate of the numerical solution is $O(h^{1/2})$ in convex domains and $O(h^{s-1/2})$ in nonconvex domains, where $s &gt; 1/2$ depends on the geometry of the domain. The analysis is based on a regularized approach and a rigorous estimate for the corresponding dual problem. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretically predicted convergence rates for the proposed mixed method for Poisson's equation with rough boundary data.</description>

      <title>Multi-goal-oriented anisotropic error control and mesh adaptivity for time-dependent convection-dominated problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an anisotropic multi-goal error control based on the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method for time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations. This multi-goal oriented approach allows for an accurate and efficient error control with regard to several quantities of interest simultaneously. Using anisotropic interpolation and restriction operators, we obtain elementwise error indicators in space and time, where the spatial indicators are additionally separated with respect to the single directions. The directional error indicators quantify anisotropy of the solution with respect to the goals, and produce adaptive, anisotropic meshes that efficiently capture layers. To prevent spurious oscillations the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method is applied to stabilize the underlying system in the case of high P\'{e}clet numbers. Numerical examples show efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach for several goal quantities using established benchmarks for convection-dominated transport.</description>

      <title>A posteriori and a priori error estimates for linearized thin sheet folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a posteriori error analysis for a discontinuous Galerkin method for a fourth order elliptic interface problem that arises from a linearized model of thin sheet folding. The primary contribution is a local efficiency bound for an estimator that measures the extent to which the interface conditions along the fold are satisfied, which is accomplished by constructing a novel edge bubble function. We subsequently conduct a medius analysis to obtain improved a priori error estimates under the minimal regularity assumption on the exact solution. The performance of the method is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Segmentation-Based Regression for Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum hardware motivate the development of algorithmic frameworks that integrate quantum sampling with classical inference. This work introduces a segmentation-based regression method tailored to quantum neural networks (QNNs), where real-valued outputs are encoded as base-b digit sequences and inferred through greedy digitwise optimization. By casting the regression task as a constrained combinatorial problem over a structured digit lattice, the method replaces continuous inference with interpretable and tractable updates. A hybrid quantum-classical architecture is employed: quantum circuits generate candidate digits through projective measurement, while classical forward models evaluate these candidates based on task-specific error functionals. We formalize the algorithm from first principles, derive convergence and complexity bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness on inverse problems involving PDE-constrained models. The resulting framework provides a robust, high-precision interface between quantum outputs and continuous scientific inference.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Lift &amp; Learn: Scientific machine learning for nonlinear conservative partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift &amp; Learn, a scientific machine learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift &amp; Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Affine-Invariant Global Non-Asymptotic Convergence Analysis of BFGS under Self-Concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish global non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the BFGS quasi-Newton method without requiring strong convexity or the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient or Hessian. Instead, we consider the setting where the objective function is strictly convex and strongly self-concordant. For an arbitrary initial point and any arbitrary positive-definite initial Hessian approximation, we prove global linear and superlinear convergence guarantees for BFGS when the step size is determined using a line search scheme satisfying the weak Wolfe conditions. Moreover, all our global guarantees are affine-invariant, with the convergence rates depending solely on the initial error and the strongly self-concordant constant. Our results extend the global non-asymptotic convergence theory of BFGS beyond traditional assumptions and, for the first time, establish affine-invariant convergence guarantees aligning with the inherent affine invariance of the BFGS method.</description>

      <title>Learning collective variables that respect permutational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to translational and rotational symmetries, clusters of identical interacting particles possess permutational symmetry. Coarse-grained models for such systems are instrumental in identifying metastable states, providing an effective description of their dynamics, and estimating transition rates. We propose a numerical framework for learning collective variables that respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries, and for estimating transition rates and residence times. It combines a sort-based featurization, residence manifold learning in the feature space, and learning collective variables with autoencoders whose loss function utilizes the orthogonality relationship (Legoll and Lelievre, 2010). The committor of the resulting reduced model is used as the reaction coordinate in the forward flux sampling and to design a control for sampling the transition path process. We offer two case studies, the Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and the Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The transition rates and residence times computed with the aid of the reduced models agree with those obtained via brute-force methods.</description>

      <title>Forward Reverse Kernel Regression for the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (SBP), which is central to entropic optimal transport. For general reference processes and begin--endpoint distributions, we propose a forward-reverse iterative Monte Carlo procedure to approximate the Schr\"odinger potentials in a nonparametric way. In particular, we use kernel based Monte Carlo regression in the context of Picard iteration of a corresponding fixed point problem. By preserving in the iteration positivity and contractivity in a Hilbert metric sense, we develop a provably convergent algorithm. Furthermore, we provide convergence rates for the potential estimates and prove their optimality. Finally, as an application, we propose a non-nested Monte Carlo procedure for the final dimensional distributions of the Schr\"odinger Bridge process, based on the constructed potentials and the forward-reverse simulation method for conditional diffusions.</description>

      <title>A convex lifting approach for the Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Calder\'on problem consists in recovering an unknown coefficient of a partial differential equation from boundary measurements of its solution. These measurements give rise to a highly nonlinear forward operator. As a consequence, the development of reconstruction methods for this inverse problem is challenging, as they usually suffer from the problem of local convergence. To circumvent this issue, we propose an alternative approach based on lifting and convex relaxation techniques, that have been successfully developed for solving finite-dimensional quadratic inverse problems. This leads to a convex optimization problem whose solution coincides with the sought-after coefficient, provided that a non-degenerate source condition holds. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on a toy model where the solution of the partial differential equation is known everywhere in the domain. In this simplified setting, we verify that the non-degenerate source condition holds under certain assumptions on the unknown coefficient. We leave the investigation of its validity in the Calder\'on setting for future works.</description>

      <title>General Perturbation Resilient Dynamic String-Averaging for Inconsistent Problems with Superiorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a General Dynamic String-Averaging (GDSA) iterative scheme and investigate its convergence properties in the inconsistent case, that is, when the input operators don't have a common fixed point. The Dynamic String-Averaging Projection (DSAP) algorithm itself was introduced in an 2013 paper, where its strong convergence and bounded perturbation resilience were studied in the consistent case (that is, when the sets under consideration had a nonempty intersection). Results involving combination of the DSAP method with superiorization, were presented in 2015. The proof of the weak convergence of our GDSA method is based on the notion of "strong coherence" of sequences of operators that was introduced in 2019. This is an improvement of the property of "coherence" of sequences of operators introduced in 2001 by Bauschke and Combettes. Strong coherence provides a more convenient sufficient convergence condition for methods that employ infinite sequences of operators and it turns out to be a useful general tool when applied to proving the convergence of many iterative methods. In this paper we combine the ideas of both dynamic string-averaging and strong coherence, in order to analyze our GDSA method for a general class of operators and its bounded perturbation resilience in the inconsistent case with weak and strong convergence. We then discuss an application of the GDSA method to the Superiorization Methodology, developing results on the behavior of its superiorized version.</description>

      <title>A simplified unified wave-particle method for diatomic gases with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypersonic flow around near-space vehicles constitutes a multi-scale flow problem. Due to insufficient molecular collisions to achieve equilibrium, rarefied gas effects are present in the flow field. Thus, numerical methods capable of accurately resolving multi-scale flows are required. Furthermore, high-temperature gas effects in hypersonic flows mean vibrational excitation of polyatomic molecules. Consequently, numerical methods accounting for non-equilibrium in rotational and vibrational internal energy modes are required. This study derives a quantified model-competition (QMC) mechanism for diatomic gases with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium, starting from integral solutions of kinetic model equations with rotational and vibrational energy. The QMC mechanism categorize collisional and free-transport particles in cell, applying computational weighting based on their local scale regimes. We developed a simplified unified wave-particle (SUWP) method for diatomic gases based on QMC mechanism. For the macroscopic of the method, a three-temperature model accounting for rotational and vibrational energy is incorporated into both the kinetic inviscid flux scheme and {Navier-Stokes} solvers. For the microscopic of the method, a collisionless DSMC solver is employed to resolve non-equilibrium flow physics. This work validates the proposed SUWP method with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium through benchmark cases, including shock tube, shock structures, flow past a cylinder, Apollo 6 command module and space station Mir. Compared to the DSMC and deterministic methods, the SUWP method exhibits favorable computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>Swarm-based optimization with jumps: a kinetic BGK framework and convergence analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are powerful tools for global optimization, particularly for non-convex and non-differentiable problems where exact methods are often impractical. Particle-based optimization methods, inspired by swarm intelligence principles, have shown effectiveness due to their ability to balance exploration and exploitation within the search space. In this work, we introduce a novel particle-based optimization algorithm where velocities are updated via random jumps, a strategy commonly used to enhance stochastic exploration. We formalize this approach by describing the dynamics through a kinetic modelling of BGK type, offering a unified framework that accommodates general noise distributions, including heavy-tailed ones like Cauchy. Under suitable parameter scaling, the model reduces to the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) dynamics. For non-degenerate Gaussian noise in bounded domains, we prove propagation of chaos and convergence towards minimizers. Numerical results on benchmark problems validate the approach and highlight its connection to CBO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithmic framework for performing QR factorization with column pivoting (QRCP) on general matrices. The framework enables the design of practical QRCP algorithms through user-controlled choices for the core subroutines. We provide a comprehensive overview of how to navigate these choices on modern hardware platforms, offering detailed descriptions of alternative methods for both CPUs and GPUs. The practical QRCP algorithms developed within this framework are implemented as part of the open-source RandLAPACK library. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that, on a dual AMD EPYC 9734 system, the proposed method achieves performance improvements of up to two orders of magnitude over LAPACK's standard QRCP routine and greatly surpasses the performance of the current state-of-the-art randomized QRCP algorithm. Additionally, on an NVIDIA H100 GPU, our method attains approximately 65 percent of the performance of cuSOLVER's unpivoted QR factorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel variational formulation of layer potentials and boundary integral operators generalizes their classical construction by Green's functions, which are not explicitly available for Helmholtz problems with variable coefficients. Wavenumber explicit estimates and properties like jump conditions follow directly from their variational definition and enable a non-local (``integral'') formulation of acoustic transmission problems (TP) with piecewise Lipschitz coefficients. We obtain the well-posedness of the integral equations directly from the stability of the underlying TP. The simultaneous analysis for general dimensions and complex wavenumbers (in this paper) imposes an artificial boundary on the external Helmholtz problem and employs recent insights into the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Subspace method of moments for ab initio 3-D single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a widely-used technique for recovering the 3-D structure of biological molecules from a large number of experimentally generated noisy 2-D tomographic projection images of the 3-D structure, taken from unknown viewing angles. Through computationally intensive algorithms, these observed images are processed to reconstruct the 3-D structures. Many popular computational methods rely on estimating the unknown angles as part of the reconstruction process, which becomes particularly challenging at low signal-to-noise ratios. The method of moments (MoM) offers an alternative approach that circumvents the estimation of viewing orientations of individual projection images by instead estimating the underlying distribution of the viewing angles, and is robust to noise given sufficiently many images. However, the method of moments typically entails computing high-order moments of the projection images, incurring significant computational and memory costs. To mitigate this, we propose a new approach called the subspace method of moments (subspace MoM), which compresses the first three moments using data-driven low-rank tensor techniques as well as expansion into a suitable function basis. The compressed moments can be efficiently computed from the set of projection images using numerical quadrature and can be employed to jointly reconstruct the 3-D structure and the distribution of viewing orientations. We illustrate the practical applicability of the subspace MoM through numerical experiments using up to the third-order moment on synthetic datasets with a simplified cryo-EM image formation model, which significantly improves the resolution of MoM reconstructions compared to previous approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study monotone finite difference approximations for a broad class of reaction-diffusion problems, incorporating general symmetric L\'evy operators. By employing an adaptive time-stepping discretization, we derive the discrete Fujita critical exponent for these problems. Additionally, under general consistency assumptions, we establish the convergence of discrete blow-up times to their continuous counterparts. As complementary results, we also present the asymptotic-in-time behavior of discrete heat-type equations as well as an extensive analysis of discrete eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accumulation-based operations, such as summation and matrix multiplication, are fundamental to numerous computational domains. However, their accumulation orders are often undocumented in existing software and hardware implementations, making it difficult for developers to ensure consistent results across systems. To address this issue, we introduce FPRev, a diagnostic tool designed to reveal the accumulation order in the software and hardware implementations through numerical testing. With FPRev, developers can identify and compare accumulation orders, enabling developers to create reproducible software and verify implementation equivalence.
  FPRev is a testing-based tool that non-intrusively reveals the accumulation order by analyzing the outputs of the tested implementation for distinct specially designed inputs. Employing FPRev, we showcase the accumulation orders of popular libraries (such as NumPy and PyTorch) on CPUs and GPUs (including GPUs with specialized matrix accelerators such as Tensor Cores). We also validate the efficiency of FPRev through extensive experiments. FPRev exhibits a lower time complexity compared to the basic solution.

      <title>On the convergence of two-step modified Newton method for nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations from transport theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the convergence of a two-step modified Newton method for solving the nonlinear system arising from the minimal nonnegative solution of nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations from neutron transport theory. We show the monotonic convergence of the two-step modified Newton method under mild assumptions. When the Jacobian of the nonlinear operator at the minimal positive solution is singular, we present a convergence analysis of the two-step modified Newton method in this context. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method yields comparable results to several existing Newton-type methods and that it brings a significant reduction in computation time for nearly singular and large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>An artificial viscosity approach to high order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods improve the robustness of high order DG simulations of nonlinear conservation laws. These methods yield a semi-discrete entropy inequality, and rely on an algebraic flux differencing formulation which involves both summation-by-parts (SBP) discretization matrices and entropy conservative two-point finite volume fluxes. However, explicit expressions for such two-point finite volume fluxes may not be available for all systems, or may be computationally expensive to compute.
  This paper proposes an alternative approach to constructing entropy stable DG methods using an entropy correction artificial viscosity, where the artificial viscosity coefficient is determined based on the local violation of a cell entropy inequality and the local entropy dissipation. The resulting method \bnote{is a modification of the entropy correction introduced by Abgrall, Offner, and Ranocha (2022) in "Reinterpretation and Extension of Entropy Correction Terms for Residual Distribution and Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes: Application to Structure Preserving Discretization", and recovers the same global semi-discrete entropy inequality that is satisfied by entropy stable flux differencing DG methods. The entropy correction artificial viscosity coefficients are parameter-free and locally computable over each cell, and the resulting artificial viscosity preserves both high order accuracy and a hyperbolic maximum stable time-step size under explicit time-stepping.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation law and maximum bound principle-preserving linear BDF2 schemes with variable steps for the Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a linear, structure-preserving scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method for solving the Allen--Cahn equation based on the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) with variable time steps. To this end, we first design a novel and essential auxiliary functional that serves twofold functions: (i) ensuring that a first-order approximation to the auxiliary variable, which is essentially important for deriving the unconditional energy dissipation law, does not affect the second-order temporal accuracy of the phase function $\phi$; and (ii) allowing us to develop effective stabilization terms that are helpful to establish the MBP-preserving linear methods. Together with this novel functional and standard central difference stencil, we then propose a linear, second-order variable-step BDF2 type stabilized exponential SAV scheme, namely BDF2-sESAV-I, which is shown to preserve both the discrete modified energy dissipation law under the temporal stepsize ratio $ 0 &lt; r_{k} := \tau_{k}/\tau_{k-1} &lt; 4.864 - \delta $ with a positive constant $\delta$ and the MBP under $ 0 &lt; r_{k} &lt; 1 + \sqrt{2} $. Moreover, an analysis of the approximation to the original energy by the modified one is presented. With the help of the kernel recombination technique, optimal $ H^{1}$- and $ L^{\infty}$-norm error estimates of the variable-step BDF2-sESAV-I scheme are rigorously established. Numerical examples are carried out to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Improving the scalability of a high-order atmospheric dynamics solver based on the deal.II library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present recent advances on the massively parallel performance of a numerical scheme for atmosphere dynamics applications based on the deal.II library. The implicit-explicit discontinuous finite element scheme is based on a matrix-free approach, meaning that no global sparse matrix is built and only the action of the linear operators on a vector is actually implemented. Following a profiling analysis, we focus on the performance optimization of the numerical method and describe the impact of different preconditioning and solving techniques in this framework. Moreover, we show how the use of the latest version of the deal.II library and of suitable execution flags can improve the parallel performance.</description>

      <title>Triangular preconditioners for double saddle point linear systems arising in the mixed form of poroelasticity equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of inexact block triangular preconditioners for double saddle-point symmetric linear systems arising from the mixed finite element and mixed hybrid finite element discretization of Biot's poroelasticity equations. We develop a spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrix, showing that the complex eigenvalues lie in a circle of center $(1,0)$ and radius smaller than 1. In contrast, the real eigenvalues are described in terms of the roots of a third-degree polynomial with real coefficients. The results of numerical experiments are reported to show the quality of the theoretical bounds and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners used with GMRES, especially in comparison with similar block diagonal preconditioning strategies along with the MINRES iteration.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for the Arnoldi Approximation of a Matrix Square Root</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Arnoldi process provides an efficient framework for approximating functions of a matrix applied to a vector, i.e., of the form $f(M)\mathbf{b}$, by repeated matrix-vector multiplications. In this paper, we derive an \textit{a priori} error estimate for approximating the action of a matrix square root using the Arnoldi process, where the integral representation of the error is reformulated in terms of the error for solving the linear system $M\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$. The results extend the error analysis of the Lanczos method for Hermitian matrices in [Chen et al., SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 2022] to non-Hermitian cases. Furthermore, to make the method applicable to large-scale problems, we assume that the matrices are preprocessed utilizing data-sparse approximations preserving positive definiteness, and then establish a refined error bound in this setting. The numerical results on matrices with different structures demonstrate that our theoretical analysis yields a reliable upper bound. Finally, simulations on large-scale matrices arising in particulate suspensions validate the effectiveness and practicality of the approach.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Explicit-Implicit Predictor-Corrector Exponential Time-Differencing Multistep Pad\'{e} Schemes for Semilinear Parabolic Equations with Time-Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze ETD-Multistep-Pad\'{e} (ETD-MS-Pad\'{e}) and ETD Implicit Multistep-Pad\'{e} (ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e}) for semilinear parabolic delay differential equations with smooth solutions. In our previous work [15], we proposed ETD-RK-Pad\'{e} scheme to compute high-order numerical solutions for nonlinear parabolic reaction-diffusion equation with constant time delay. However, the based ETD-RK numerical scheme in [15] is very complex and the corresponding calculation program is also very complicated. We propose in this paper ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} and ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} schemes for the solution of semilinear parabolic equations with delay. We synergize the ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} with ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} to construct efficient predictor-corrector scheme. This new predictor-corrector scheme will become an important tool for solving the numerical solutions of parabolic differential equations. Remarkably, we also conducted experiments in Table$10$ to compare the numerical results of the predictor-corrector scheme with the EERK scheme proposed in paper [42]. The predictor-corrector scheme demonstrated better convergence.
  The main idea is to employ an ETD-based Adams multistep extrapolation for the time integration of the corresponding equation. To overcome the well-known numerical instability associated with computing the exponential operator, we utilize the Pad\'{e} approach to approximate this exponential operator. This methodology leads to the development of the ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} and ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} schemes, applicable even for arbitrary time orders. We validate the ETD-MS1,2,3,4-Pad\'{e} schemes and ETD-IMS2,3,4 schemes through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An Unconditional Representation of the Conditional Score in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score-function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a task-dependent score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived exactly from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Formulation of the Role of Shear Loads on Multi-Layered Thin Shells and Classification of Their Deformation Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shell structures are generally modeled based on kinematic hypotheses, where some of the parameters are preferentially evaluated in a phenomenological manner. In this article, asymptotic analysis against the underlying three-dimensional equation system is considered so as to provide a rational framework for modeling and interpreting the deformation behavior of multi-layered thin shells (MTSs). Capable of accurately predicting both overall stiffness and detailed stress distribution, the proposed shell theory shows its distinguishing features at least in the following aspects. Firstly, it naturally introduces a rule for classifying the deformation modes of MTSs based on the magnitude of the maximum dimensionless principal curvature. Secondly, for each class, the hierarchy in the order of the involved field quantities is examined, and it is shown that when the product of the maximum principal curvature and the characteristic shell size reaches the magnitude of unity or larger, the resulting shell theory cannot be treated by natural extension of plate theories. Lastly, it is demonstrated that, for moderate shear forces and comparable material properties, a leading-order multi-layered shell theory derived from asymptotic analysis should suffice to output satisfactory predictions over the shell stiffness, as well as its internal stress distribution. Numerical examples of the deformation and strength analysis for MTSs are also presented to show the reliability of the leading-order model.</description>

      <title>Level-set topology optimisation with unfitted finite elements and automatic shape differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop automatic shape differentiation techniques for unfitted discretisations and link these to recent advances in shape calculus for unfitted methods. We extend existing analytic shape calculus results to the case where the domain boundary intersects with the boundary of the background domain. We further show that we can recover these analytic derivatives to machine precision regardless of the mesh size using the developed automatic shape differentiation techniques, drastically reducing the burden associated with the analytic derivation of these quantities. In addition, we show that we can also recover the symmetric shape Hessian. We implement these techniques for both serial and distributed computing frameworks in the Julia package GridapTopOpt and the wider Gridap ecosystem. As part of this implementation we propose a novel graph-based approach for isolated volume detection. We demonstrate the applicability of the unfitted automatic shape differentiation framework and our implementation by considering the three-dimensional minimum compliance topology optimisation of a linear elastic wheel and of a linear elastic structure in a fluid-structure interaction problem with Stokes flow. The implementation is general and allows GridapTopOpt to solve a wider range of problems on unstructured meshes without analytic calculation of shape derivatives and avoiding issues that arise when material properties are smoothed at the domain boundary. The software is open source and available at https://github.com/zjwegert/GridapTopOpt.jl.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean dual gradient ascent for entropically regularized linear and semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimization framework that exhibits dimension-independent convergence on a broad class of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</description>

Abstract: We analyze pivot probabilities in Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) for $2 \times 2$ random matrix ensembles. For GUE matrices, we resolve a previously reported discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical observations by deriving the exact pivot probability under standard LAPACK-style implementations. We further show that Dumitriu-Edelman tridiagonal $\beta$-ensembles agree with the earlier theoretical expectations.</description>
