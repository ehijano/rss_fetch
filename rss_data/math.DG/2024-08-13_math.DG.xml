      <title>Canal Hypersurfaces Generated by Non-Null Curves with Parallel Frame in Minkowski Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, firstly we obtain the canal hypersurfaces that are formed as the envelope of a family of pseudo hyperspheres or pseudo hyperbolic hyperspheres whose centers lie on a spacelike curve with parallel timelike normal vector field $B_{2}$ in Minkowski space-time and we give some geometric characterizations for them by obtaining the Gaussian curvature, mean curvature and principal curvatures of these canal hypersurfaces. Also, we give the general expression of parametrizations of the canal hypersurfaces generated by non-null curves with parallel frame in $E_{1}^{4}$ and we obtain some important geometric invariants and characterizations for them.</description>

Abstract: Nevanlinna's unicity theorems have always held an important position in value distribution theory. The main purpose of this paper is to generalize the classical Nevanlinna's unicity theorems to non-compact complete Kahler manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature or nonnegative Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Solitonic Inequalities in Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Riemannian geometry, Ricci soliton inequalities are an important field of study that provide profound insights into the geometric and analytic characteristics of Riemannian manifolds. An extensive study of Ricci soliton inequalities is given in this review article, which also summarizes their historical evolution, core ideas, important findings, and applications. We investigate the complex interactions between curvature conditions and geometric inequalities as well as the several kinds of Ricci solitons, such as expanding, steady, and shrinking solitons. We also go over current developments, unresolved issues, and possible paths for further study in this fascinating area.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Metallic Riemannian Geometry: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic structures, introduced by V. de Spinadel in 2002, opened a new avenue in differential geometry. Building upon this concept, C. E. Hre\c{t}canu and M. Crasmareanu laid the foundation for metallic Riemannian manifolds in 2013. The field's rich potential and diverse applications have since attracted significant research efforts, leading to a wealth of valuable insights. This review delves into the latest advances in metallic Riemannian geometry, a rapidly progressing area within the broader field of differential geometry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a method to construct bimetric conformal invarints by the linear metric perturbations and the conformal invarints. And we compute the metric perturbations of the Connes conformal invarints and the conformal Laplacian. As corollaries, some new bimetric conformal invarints on 4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds without boundary are obtained and we get the first order and second order variations of the Connes conformal invarints.</description>

      <title>Causal ladder of Finsler spacetimes with a cone Killing vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence between wind Riemannian structures and spacetimes endowed with a Killing vector field is deepened by considering a cone structure endowed with a vector field that preserve the structure (termed "cone Killing vector field") and a wind Finslerian structure. Causality properties of the former are characterized by using metric-type properties of the latter. A particular attention is posed to the case of a cone structure associated with a Finsler-Kropina type metric, i.e. a field of compact and strongly convex indicatrices that enclose the zero vector in the closure of its bounded interior at each tangent space of the manifold.</description>

      <title>The geometry of geodesic invariant functions and applications to Landsberg surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for a given spray $S$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, we investigate the geometry of $S$-invariant functions. For an $S$-invariant function $\P$, we associate a vertical subdistribution $\V_\P$ and find the relation between the holonomy distribution and $\V_\P$ by showing that the vertical part of the holonomy distribution is the intersection of \ok{all spaces $\V_{\F_S}$ associated to $\F_S$ where $\F_S$} is the set of all Finsler functions that have the geodesic spray $S$. As an application, we study the Landsberg Finsler surfaces. We prove that a Landsberg surface with $S$-invariant flag curvature is Riemannian or has a vanishing flag curvature. We show that for Landsberg surfaces with non-vanishing flag curvature, the flag curvature is $S$-invariant if and only if it is constant, in this case, the surface is Riemannian. Finally, for a Berwald surface, we prove that the flag curvature is $H$-invariant if and only if it is constant.</description>

      <title>Controllability of the rolling system of a Lorentzian manifold on ${\mathbb R}^{n,1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mechanical system associated with rolling a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n+1\geq2$ on flat Lorentzian space $\widehat{M}={\mathbb R}^{n,1}$, without slipping or twisting. Using previous results, it is known that there exists a distribution $\mathcal{D}_R$ of rank $(n+1)$ defined on the configuration space $Q(M,\widehat{M})$ of the rolling system, encoding the no-slip and no-twist conditions. Our objective is to study the problem of complete controllability of the control system associated with $\mathcal{D}_R$. The key lies in examining the holonomy group of the distribution $\mathcal{D}_R$ and, following the approach of \cite{ChKok}, establishing that the rolling problem is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ equals $SO_0(n,1)$.</description>

      <title>New quermassintegral and Poincar\'{e} type inequalities for non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we study the following non-homogeneous, locally constrained inverse curvature flow in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, \begin{align*} \dot{x}=\left(\frac{1}{\frac{E_k(\hat{\kappa})}{E_{k-1}(\hat{\kappa})}-\alpha }-\langle x,\nu\rangle\right)\nu, \quad k=2,3,\ldots,n-1. \end{align*} Assuming that the initial hypersurface $\mathcal{M}_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is star-shaped and its shifted principal curvatures $\hat{\kappa}=\kappa+\alpha(1,\ldots,1)$ lie in the convex set \begin{align*} \Gamma_{\alpha,k}:=\Gamma_{k-1}\cap \{\lambda\in \mathbb{R}^n:\, E_k(\lambda)-\alpha E_{k-1}(\lambda)&gt;0\}, \end{align*} we show that the flow admits a smooth solution that exists for all positive times, and it converges smoothly to a round sphere. As a corollary, we obtain a new set of Alexandrov-Fenchel-type inequalities for non-convex domains.
  In the second part, we derive a Poincar\'{e} type inequality for $k$-convex hypersurfaces which complements a more general version of the well-known Heintze-Karcher inequality.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the Poisson kernel on negatively curved Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional Hadamard manifold of pinched negative curvature $-b^2 \leq K_M \leq -a^2$. The solution of the Dirichlet problem at infinity for $M$ leads to the construction of a family of mutually absolutely continuous probability measures $\{\mu_x\}_{x \in M}$ called the harmonic measures. Fixing a basepoint $o \in M$, the Poisson kernel of $M$ is the function $P : M \times \partial M \to (0, \infty)$ defined by \begin{equation*} P(x, \xi) = \frac{d\mu_x}{d\mu_o}(\xi) \ , \ x \in M, \xi \in \partial M. \end{equation*} We prove the following global upper and lower bounds for the Poisson kernel: \begin{equation*} \frac{1}{C}\: e^{-2K{(o|\xi)}_x}\: e^{a d(x, o)} \le P(x,\xi) \le C\: e^{2K{(x|\xi)}_o}\: e^{-a d(x,o)} \:, \end{equation*} for some positive constants $C \geq 1, K &gt; 0$ depending solely on $a, b$ and $n$. The above estimates may be viewed as a generalization of the well-known formula for the Poisson kernel in terms of Busemann functions for the special case of Gromov hyperbolic harmonic manifolds. These estimates do not follow directly from known estimates on Green's functions or harmonic measures. Instead we use techniques due to Anderson-Schoen for estimating positive harmonic functions in cones. As applications, we obtain quantitative estimates for the convergence $\mu_x \to \delta_{\xi}$ as $x \in M \to \xi \in \partial M$, and for the convergence of harmonic measures on finite spheres to the harmonic measures on the boundary at infinity as the radius of the spheres tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e reduction for central extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of central extensions of Lie groups and Lie algebras to derive the viscous quasi-geostrophic (QGS) equations, with and without Rayleigh friction term, on the torus as critical points of a stochastic Lagrangian. We begin by introducing central extensions and proving the integrability of the Roger Lie algebra cocycle $\omega_\alpha$, which is used to model the QGS on the torus. Incorporating stochastic perturbations, we formulate two specific semi-martingales on the central extension and study the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e reduction. Specifically, we add stochastic perturbations to the $\mathfrak{g}$ part of the extended Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}} = \mathfrak{g} \rtimes_{\omega_\alpha} \mathbb{R}$ and prove that the resulting critical points of the stochastic right-invariant Lagrangian solve the viscous QGS equation, with and without Rayleigh friction term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Gaiotto's conformal limit for the $G^{\mathbb{R}}$-Hitchin equations, when $G^{\mathbb{R}}$ is a simple real Lie group admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure. We identify a family of flat connections coming from certain solutions to the equations for which the conformal limit exists and admits the structure of an oper. We call this new class of opers appearing in the conformal limit $\Theta$-positive opers. The two families involved are parameterized by the same base space. This space is a generalization of the base of Hitchin's integrable system in the case when the structure group is a split real group.</description>

      <title>The weighted Hermite--Einstein equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new weighted version of the Hermite--Einstein equation, along with notions of weighted slope (semi/poly)stability, and prove that a vector bundle admits a weighted Hermite--Einstein metric if and only if it is weighted slope polystable. The new equation encompasses several well-known examples of canonical Hermitian metrics on vector bundles, including the usual Hermite--Einstein metrics, K\"ahler--Ricci solitons, and transversally Hermite--Einstein metrics on certain Sasaki manifolds. We prove that the equation arises naturally as a moment map, that solutions to the equation are unique up to scaling, and demonstrate a weighted Kobayashi--L\"ubke inequality satisfied by vector bundles admitting a weighted Hermite--Einstein metric. As an application of our techniques, we extend a bound of Tian on the Ricci curvature to a bound on a modified Ricci curvature, related to the existence of K\"ahler--Ricci solitons. Along the way, we introduce a new weighted vortex equation, as well as a weighted analogue of Gieseker stability. A key technical point is the application of a new extension of Inoue's equivariant intersection numbers to arbitrary weight functions on the moment polytope of a K\"ahler manifold with Hamiltonian torus action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the nonlocal Almgren problem, the goal is to investigate the convexity of a minimizer under a mass constraint via a nonlocal free energy generated with some nonlocal perimeter and convex potential. In the paper, the main result is a quantitative stability theorem for the nonlocal free energy assuming symmetry on the potential. In addition, several results that involve uniqueness, non-existence, and moduli estimates from the theory for crystals are proven also in the nonlocal context.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a series of blowups $(\widetilde M_i,\pi_i)_{i\in \mathbb N_0}$ of a singular foliation by applying to the universal Lie $\infty$-algebroid of a singular foliation the so-called Nash modification. For $i=0$, we recover a blowup introduced Sinan Sert\"oz, and for $i=1$, we recover a notion due to Omar Mohsen. One of the important features is that any singular foliation becomes a Debord foliation (= projective singular foliation) after one blowup. Examples are also given.</description>

      <title>Surfaces of constant principal-curvatures ratio in isotropic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study surfaces with a constant ratio of principal curvatures in Euclidean and simply isotropic geometries and characterize rotational, channel, ruled, helical, and translational surfaces of this kind under some technical restrictions (the latter two cases only in isotropic geometry). We use the interlacing of various methods of differential geometry, including line geometry and Lie sphere geometry, ordinary differential equations, and elementary algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>On the classification of discrete conformal structures on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glickenstein \cite{Glickenstein} and Glickenstein-Thomas \cite{GT} introduced the discrete conformal structures on surfaces in an axiomatic approach and studied its classification. In this paper, we give a full classification of the discrete conformal structures on surfaces, which completes Glickenstein-Thomas' classification. As a result, we find some new classes of discrete conformal structures on surfaces, including some of the generalized circle packing metrics introduced by Guo-Luo \cite{GL2}. The relationships between the discrete conformal structures on surfaces and the 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates of the Finslerian Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study bounded positive solutions to the Finslerian Allen-Cahn equation. The Allen-Cahn equation is widely applied and connected to many mathematical branches. We find the Finslerian Allen-Cahn equation is also an Euler-Lagrange equation to a Liapunov entropy functional. We prove the global gradient estimates of its positive solutions on compact Finsler metric measure spaces adopting the lower bounds of the weighted Ricci curvature. Moreover, as application of a new comparison theorem developed by the author, we also get a local gradient estimates on noncompact forward complete Finsler metric measure spaces with locally finite misalignment, combining with the bounds of some non-Riemannian curvatures and the lower bound mixed weighted Ricci curvature. At last, we give a Liouville type theorem of such solutions.</description>

      <title>Li-Yau Estimates for a Nonlinear Parabolic Equation on Finsler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the positive solutions to the Finslerian nonlinear equation $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \Delta^{\nabla u} u + au\log u + bu,$$ which is related to Ricci solitons and serves as the Euler-Lagrange equation to the Finslerian log-energy functional. We then obtain the global gradient estimate of its positive solution on a compact Finsler metric measure space with the weighted Ricci curvature bounded below. Furthermore, using a new comparison theorem developed by the first author, we also establish a local gradient estimate on a non-compact forward complete Finsler metric measure spaces with the mixed weighted Ricci curvature bounded below, as well as finite bounds of misalignment and some non-Riemannian curvatures. Lastly, we prove the Harnack inequalities and a Liouville-type theorem of such solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cartan development takes a Lie algebra valued 1-form satisfying the Maurer-Cartan equation on a simply connected manifold $M$ to a smooth mapping from $M$ into the Lie group. In this paper this is generalized to infinite dimensional $M$ for infinite dimensional regular Lie groups. The Cartan development is viewed as a generalization of the evolution map of a regular Lie group. The tangent mapping of a Cartan development is identified as another Cartan development.</description>

      <title>Bending-Neutral Deformations of Minimal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. Here they are considered as geometric objects that bear a deformation content. By refining the resolution of the surface deformation gradient afforded by the polar decomposition theorem, we identify a bending content and a class of deformations that leave it unchanged. These are the bending-neutral deformations, fully characterized by an integrability condition; they preserve normals. We prove that (1) every minimal surface is transformed into a minimal surface by a bending-neutral deformation, (2) given two minimal surfaces with the same system of normals, there is a bending-neutral deformation that maps one into the other, and (3) all minimal surfaces have indeed a universal bending content.</description>

      <title>Minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{4}(1)$ by doubling the equatorial $\mathbb{S}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each large enough $m\in\mathbb{N}$ we construct by PDE gluing methods a closed embedded smooth minimal hypersurface ${\breve{M}_m}$ doubling the equatorial three-sphere $\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{eq}}^3$ in $\mathbb{S}^4(1)$, with ${\breve{M}_m}$ containing $m^2$ bridges modelled after the three-dimensional catenoid and centered at the points of a square $m\times m$ lattice $L$ contained in the Clifford torus $\mathbb{T}^2\subset \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{eq}}^3$. This answers a long-standing question of Yau in the case of $\mathbb{S}^4(1)$ and long-standing questions of Hsiang. Similarly we construct a self-shrinker ${\breve{M}_{\mathrm{shr},m}}$ of the Mean Curvature Flow in $\mathbb{R}^4$ doubling the three-dimensional spherical self-shrinker $\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{shr}}^3\subset \mathbb{R}^4$ with the bridges centered at the points of a square $m\times m$ lattice $L$ contained in a Clifford torus $\mathbb{T}^2\subset \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{shr}}^3$. Both constructions respect the symmetries of the lattice $L$ as a subset of $\mathbb{S}^4(1)$ or $\mathbb{R}^4$ and are based on the Linearized Doubling (LD) methodology which was first introduced in the construction of minimal surface doublings of $\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{eq}}^2$ in $\mathbb{S}^3(1)$. Furthermore $\breve{M}_m$ converges as $m \to\infty$ in the varifold sense to $2\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{eq}}^3$, and its volume $|\breve{M}_m| &lt; 2|\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{eq}}^3|$.</description>

      <title>Locally Maximizing orbits for multi-dimensional Twist maps and Birkhoff billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider variational properties of exact symplectic twist maps $T$ that act on the cotangent bundle of a torus, or on a ball bundle over a sphere. An example of such a map is the well-known Birkhoff billiard map corresponding to smooth convex hypersurfaces. In this work we will focus on the important class $\mathcal{M}$ of orbits of $T$ which are locally maximizing with respect to the variational principle associated with a generating function of the symplectic twist map. Our first goal is to give geometric and variational characterization for orbits in the class $\mathcal M$.
  The billiard map is known to have two different generating functions, which brings forth a natural question: to compare the properties of these two generating functions. While our motivation comes from billiards, we will work in general, and assume that a general twist map $T$ has two generating functions. Thus we consider the orbits of $T$ which are locally maximizing with respect to either of the generating functions. We formulate a geometric criterion that guarantees that two generating functions of the same twist map have the same class of locally maximizing orbits, and we will show that the two generating functions for the Birkhoff billiard map do, in fact, satisfy this criterion. The proof of this last property will rely on the Sinai-Chernov formula from geometric optics and billiard dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the closure of a complex subtorus in a toric manifold. If the closure of the complex subtorus is a smooth complex submanifold in the toric manifold, then the subtorus action on such submanifold is Hamiltonian. In this case, we may think of the embedding of the submanifold as torus-equivariant. We show that the image of the moment map for the Hamiltonian subtorus action on our submanifold coincides with the image of the Delzant polytope of the ambient toric manifold under the pullback of the inclusion of the tori. The submanifolds constructed in the present paper are called torus-equivariantly embedded toric manifolds with respect to the subtorus action.</description>

      <title>A Dimca-Greuel type inequality for foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation at $p\in \mathbb{C}^2$, and $B$ be a separatrix of $\mathcal{F}$. Under certain conditions on the reduction of singularities of $\mathcal{F}$ and $B$, we prove the Dimca-Greuel type inequality $\frac{\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)}{\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)}&lt;4/3$, where $\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the multiplicity of $\mathcal{F}$ along $B$ and $\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the dimension of the quotient of $\mathbb C\{x,y\}$ by the ideal generated by the components of any $1$-form defining $\mathcal{F}$ and any equation of $B$. As a consequence, we provide a new proof of the $\frac{4}{3}$-Dimca-Greuel conjecture for singularities of irreducible plane curve germs, with foliations ingredients, that differs from those given by Alberich-Carrami\~nana, Almir\'on, Blanco, Melle-Hern\'andez and Genzmer-Hernandes but it is in line with the idea developed by Wang.</description>

Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up a generalization of ubiquitous one parameter families in algebraic geometry and its use for stability theories ([Mum65, HL14, AHLH23]) to families over toric varieties, Novikov type rings, or its complex analytic analogues. The language allows us to reformulate degenerations of "irrational" direction in various literatures as canonical objects in a unified manner.
  Compatibly, we generalize the stable reduction type theorem for $\Theta$-stratification in [AHLH23] of Langton type to our higher rank setup.</description>
