      <title>Technical report on target classification in SAR track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report proposes a robust method for classifying oceanic and atmospheric phenomena using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Our proposed method leverages the powerful pre-trained model Swin Transformer v2 Large as the backbone and employs carefully designed data augmentation and exponential moving average during training to enhance the model's generalization capability and stability. In the testing stage, a method called ReAct is utilized to rectify activation values and utilize Energy Score for more accurate measurement of model uncertainty, significantly improving out-of-distribution detection performance. Furthermore, test time augmentation is employed to enhance classification accuracy and prediction stability. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that each additional technique significantly improves classification accuracy, confirming their effectiveness in classifying maritime and atmospheric phenomena in SAR imagery.</description>

      <title>Solution for Authenticity Identification of Typical Target Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a basic RGB single-mode model based on weakly supervised training under pseudo labels, which performs high-precision authenticity identification under multi-scene typical target remote sensing images. Due to the imprecision of Mask generation, we divide the task into two sub-tasks: generating pseudo-mask and fine-tuning model based on generated Masks. In generating pseudo masks, we use MM-Fusion as the base model to generate masks for large objects such as planes and ships. By manually calibrating the Mask of a small object such as a car, a highly accurate pseudo-mask is obtained. For the task of fine-tuning models based on generating masks, we use the WSCL model as the base model. It is worth noting that due to the difference between the generated pseudo-Masks and the real Masks, we discard the image feature extractors such as SRM and Noiseprint++ in WSCL, and select the unscaled original image for training alone, which greatly ensures the match between the image and the original label. The final trained model achieved a score of 90.7702 on the test set.</description>

      <title>Functional Imaging Constrained Diffusion for Brain PET Synthesis from Structural MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are increasingly used in multimodal analysis of neurodegenerative disorders. While MRI is broadly utilized in clinical settings, PET is less accessible. Many studies have attempted to use deep generative models to synthesize PET from MRI scans. However, they often suffer from unstable training and inadequately preserve brain functional information conveyed by PET. To this end, we propose a functional imaging constrained diffusion (FICD) framework for 3D brain PET image synthesis with paired structural MRI as input condition, through a new constrained diffusion model (CDM). The FICD introduces noise to PET and then progressively removes it with CDM, ensuring high output fidelity throughout a stable training phase. The CDM learns to predict denoised PET with a functional imaging constraint introduced to ensure voxel-wise alignment between each denoised PET and its ground truth. Quantitative and qualitative analyses conducted on 293 subjects with paired T1-weighted MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans suggest that FICD achieves superior performance in generating FDG-PET data compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further validate the effectiveness of the proposed FICD on data from a total of 1,262 subjects through three downstream tasks, with experimental results suggesting its utility and generalizability.</description>

      <title>MR-Transformer: Vision Transformer for Total Knee Replacement Prediction Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transformer-based deep learning model, MR-Transformer, was developed for total knee replacement (TKR) prediction using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The model incorporates the ImageNet pre-training and captures three-dimensional (3D) spatial correlation from the MR images. The performance of the proposed model was compared to existing state-of-the-art deep learning models for knee injury diagnosis using MRI. Knee MR scans of four different tissue contrasts from the Osteoarthritis Initiative and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study databases were utilized in the study. Experimental results demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model on TKR prediction using MRI.</description>

      <title>On Enhancing Brain Tumor Segmentation Across Diverse Populations with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a fundamental step in assessing a patient's cancer progression. However, manual segmentation demands significant expert time to identify tumors in 3D multimodal brain MRI scans accurately. This reliance on manual segmentation makes the process prone to intra- and inter-observer variability. This work proposes a brain tumor segmentation method as part of the BraTS-GoAT challenge. The task is to segment tumors in brain MRI scans automatically from various populations, such as adults, pediatrics, and underserved sub-Saharan Africa. We employ a recent CNN architecture for medical image segmentation, namely MedNeXt, as our baseline, and we implement extensive model ensembling and postprocessing for inference. Our experiments show that our method performs well on the unseen validation set with an average DSC of 85.54% and HD95 of 27.88.

      <title>I$^3$Net: Inter-Intra-slice Interpolation Network for Medical Slice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging is limited by acquisition time and scanning equipment. CT and MR volumes, reconstructed with thicker slices, are anisotropic with high in-plane resolution and low through-plane resolution. We reveal an intriguing phenomenon that due to the mentioned nature of data, performing slice-wise interpolation from the axial view can yield greater benefits than performing super-resolution from other views. Based on this observation, we propose an Inter-Intra-slice Interpolation Network (I$^3$Net), which fully explores information from high in-plane resolution and compensates for low through-plane resolution. The through-plane branch supplements the limited information contained in low through-plane resolution from high in-plane resolution and enables continual and diverse feature learning. In-plane branch transforms features to the frequency domain and enforces an equal learning opportunity for all frequency bands in a global context learning paradigm. We further propose a cross-view block to take advantage of the information from all three views online. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of I$^3$Net, and noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art super-resolution, video frame interpolation and slice interpolation methods by a large margin. We achieve 43.90dB in PSNR, with at least 1.14dB improvement under the upscale factor of $\times$2 on MSD dataset with faster inference.

      <title>DVMSR: Distillated Vision Mamba for Efficient Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to accelerate SR network inference by minimizing computational complexity and network parameters while preserving performance. Existing state-of-the-art Efficient Image Super-Resolution methods are based on convolutional neural networks. Few attempts have been made with Mamba to harness its long-range modeling capability and efficient computational complexity, which have shown impressive performance on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose DVMSR, a novel lightweight Image SR network that incorporates Vision Mamba and a distillation strategy. The network of DVMSR consists of three modules: feature extraction convolution, multiple stacked Residual State Space Blocks (RSSBs), and a reconstruction module. Specifically, the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual state space blocks (RSSB), each of which has several Vision Mamba Moudles(ViMM) together with a residual connection. To achieve efficiency improvement while maintaining comparable performance, we employ a distillation strategy to the vision Mamba network for superior performance. Specifically, we leverage the rich representation knowledge of teacher network as additional supervision for the output of lightweight student networks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed DVMSR can outperform state-of-the-art efficient SR methods in terms of model parameters while maintaining the performance of both PSNR and SSIM.

      <title>Virtual Extended-Range Tomography (VERT): Contact-free realistic ultrasonic bone imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound tomography generally struggles to reconstruct high-contrast and/or extended-range problems. A prime example is site-specific in-vivo bone imaging, crucial for accurately assessing the risk of life-threatening fractures, which are preventable given accurate diagnosis and treatment. In this type of problem, two main obstacles arise: (a) an external region prohibits access to the region of interest (ROI), and (b) high contrast exists between the two regions. These challenges impede existing algorithms -- including bent-ray tomography (BRT), known for its robustness, speed, and reasonable short-range resolution. We propose Virtual Extended-Range Tomography (VERT), which tackles these challenges through (a) placement of virtual transducers directly on the ROI, facilitating (b) rapid initialisation before BRT inversion. In-silico validation against BRT with and without a-priori information shows superior resolution and robustness -- while maintaining or even improving speed. These improvements are drastic where the external region is much larger than the ROI. Additional validation against the practically impossible -- BRT directly on the ROI -- demonstrates that VERT is approaching the resolution limit. The capability to solve high-contrast extended-range tomography problems without prior knowledge about the ROI's interior has many implications. VERT has the potential to unlock site-specific in-vivo bone imaging for assessing fracture risk, potentially saving millions of lives globally. In other applications, VERT may replace classical BRT to yield improvements in resolution, robustness and speed -- especially where the ROI does not cover the entire imaging array. For even higher resolution, VERT offers a reliable starting background to complement algorithms with less robustness and high computational costs.</description>

      <title>Infrared Polarization Imaging-based Non-destructive Thermography Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared pulse thermography non-destructive testing (NDT) method is developed based on the difference in the infrared radiation intensity emitted by defective and non-defective areas of an object. However, when the radiation intensity of the defective target is similar to that of the non-defective area of the object, the detection results are poor. To address this issue, this study investigated the polarization characteristics of the infrared radiation of different materials. Simulation results showed that the degree of infrared polarization of the object surface changed regularly with changes in thermal environment radiation. An infrared polarization imaging-based NDT method was proposed and demonstrated using specimens with four different simulated defective areas, which were designed and fabricated using four different materials. The experimental results were consistent with the simulation results, thereby proving the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the infrared-radiation-intensity-based NDT method, the proposed method improved the image detail presentation and detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Automatic Ultrasound Curve Angle Measurement via Affinity Clustering for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current clinical gold standard for evaluating adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is X-ray radiography, using Cobb angle measurement. However, the frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge due to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been validated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis assessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out manually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic system that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this end, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle (UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate landmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An affinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area to illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks. Subsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered affinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for UCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for landmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic UCA and Cobb angle (R$^2$=0.858) suggests that our proposed method can potentially replace manual UCA measurement in ultrasound scoliosis assessment.</description>

      <title>All-in-One Deep Learning Framework for MR Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, all-in-one deep learning framework for MR image reconstruction, enabling a single model to enhance image quality across multiple aspects of k-space sampling and to be effective across a wide range of clinical and technical scenarios. This DICOM-based algorithm serves as the core of SwiftMR (AIRS Medical, Seoul, Korea), which is FDA-cleared, CE-certified, and commercially available. We first detail the comprehensive development process of the model, including data collection, training pair preparation, model architecture design, and DICOM inference. We then assess the model's capability to enhance image quality in a multi-dimensional manner, specifically across various aspects of k-space sampling. Subsequently, we evaluate several features of the multi-dimensional enhancement: the accuracy of tunable denoising, the effectiveness of super-resolution in each encoding direction, and the reduction of artifacts that become more prominent at lower spatial resolutions. Additionally, we assess its compatibility with various scan parameter sets and its generalizability across scanner vendors not seen during training. Finally, we present specific cases demonstrating the model's utility in reducing scan time across anatomical regions in conjunction with protocol optimization. The proposed model is compatible with a broad spectrum of scenarios, including various vendors, pulse sequences, scan parameters, and anatomical regions. Its DICOM-based operation particularly enhances its applicability for real-world applications. Given its demonstrated effectiveness and versatility, we expect its use to expand in the field of clinical MRI.</description>

      <title>Inserting Faces inside Captions: Image Captioning with Attention Guided Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image captioning models are widely used to describe recent and archived pictures with the objective of improving their accessibility and retrieval. Yet, these approaches tend to be inefficient and biased at retrieving people's names. In this work we introduce AstroCaptions, a dataset for the image captioning task. This dataset specifically contains thousands of public fig-ures that are complex to identify for a traditional model. We also propose a novel post-processing method to insert identified people's names inside the caption using explainable AI tools and the grounding capabilities of vi-sion-language models. The results obtained with this method show signifi-cant improvements of captions quality and a potential of reducing halluci-nations. Up to 93.2% of the persons detected can be inserted in the image captions leading to improvements in the BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr and METEOR scores of each captioning model.</description>

      <title>YOLOv5 vs. YOLOv8 in Marine Fisheries: Balancing Class Detection and Instance Count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of object detection using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for three distinct classes: artemia, cyst, and excrement. In this comparative study, we analyze the performance of these models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, etc. where YOLOv5 often performed better in detecting Artemia and cysts with excellent precision and accuracy. However, when it came to detecting excrement, YOLOv5 faced notable challenges and limitations. This suggests that YOLOv8 offers greater versatility and adaptability in detection tasks while YOLOv5 may struggle in difficult situations and may need further fine-tuning or specialized training to enhance its performance. The results show insights into the suitability of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for detecting objects in challenging marine environments, with implications for applications such as ecological research.</description>

      <title>Long-term Human Participation Assessment In Collaborative Learning Environments Using Dynamic Scene Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper develops datasets and methods to assess student participation in real-life collaborative learning environments. In collaborative learning environments, students are organized into small groups where they are free to interact within their group. Thus, students can move around freely causing issues with strong pose variation, move out and re-enter the camera scene, or face away from the camera. We formulate the problem of assessing student participation into two subproblems: (i) student group detection against strong background interference from other groups, and (ii) dynamic participant tracking within the group. A massive independent testing dataset of 12,518,250 student label instances, of total duration of 21 hours and 22 minutes of real-life videos, is used for evaluating the performance of our proposed method for student group detection. The proposed method of using multiple image representations is shown to perform equally or better than YOLO on all video instances. Over the entire dataset, the proposed method achieved an F1 score of 0.85 compared to 0.80 for YOLO. Following student group detection, the paper presents the development of a dynamic participant tracking system for assessing student group participation through long video sessions. The proposed dynamic participant tracking system is shown to perform exceptionally well, missing a student in just one out of 35 testing videos. In comparison, a state of the art method fails to track students in 14 out of the 35 testing videos. The proposed method achieves 82.3% accuracy on an independent set of long, real-life collaborative videos.</description>

      <title>Continuous Learned Primal Dual</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) propose the idea that a sequence of layers in a neural network is just a discretisation of an ODE, and thus can instead be directly modelled by a parameterised ODE. This idea has had resounding success in the deep learning literature, with direct or indirect influence in many state of the art ideas, such as diffusion models or time dependant models. Recently, a continuous version of the U-net architecture has been proposed, showing increased performance over its discrete counterpart in many imaging applications and wrapped with theoretical guarantees around its performance and robustness. In this work, we explore the use of Neural ODEs for learned inverse problems, in particular with the well-known Learned Primal Dual algorithm, and apply it to computed tomography (CT) reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Design, analysis, and manufacturing of a glass-plastic hybrid minimalist aspheric panoramic annular lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a high-performance glass-plastic hybrid minimalist aspheric panoramic annular lens (ASPAL) to solve several major limitations of the traditional panoramic annular lens (PAL), such as large size, high weight, and complex system. The field of view (FoV) of the ASPAL is 360{\deg}x(35{\deg}~110{\deg}) and the imaging quality is close to the diffraction limit. This large FoV ASPAL is composed of only 4 lenses. Moreover, we establish a physical structure model of PAL using the ray tracing method and study the influence of its physical parameters on compactness ratio. In addition, for the evaluation of local tolerances of annular surfaces, we propose a tolerance analysis method suitable for ASPAL. This analytical method can effectively analyze surface irregularities on annular surfaces and provide clear guidance on manufacturing tolerances for ASPAL. Benefiting from high-precision glass molding and injection molding aspheric lens manufacturing techniques, we finally manufactured 20 ASPALs in small batches. The weight of an ASPAL prototype is only 8.5 g. Our framework provides promising insights for the application of panoramic systems in space and weight-constrained environmental sensing scenarios such as intelligent security, micro-UAVs, and micro-robots.</description>

      <title>JOSENet: A Joint Stream Embedding Network for Violence Detection in Surveillance Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the ever-increasing availability of video surveillance cameras and the growing need for crime prevention, the violence detection task is attracting greater attention from the research community. With respect to other action recognition tasks, violence detection in surveillance videos shows additional issues, such as the presence of a significant variety of real fight scenes. Unfortunately, available datasets seem to be very small compared with other action recognition datasets. Moreover, in surveillance applications, people in the scenes always differ for each video and the background of the footage differs for each camera. Also, violent actions in real-life surveillance videos must be detected quickly to prevent unwanted consequences, thus models would definitely benefit from a reduction in memory usage and computational costs. Such problems make classical action recognition methods difficult to be adopted. To tackle all these issues, we introduce JOSENet, a novel self-supervised framework that provides outstanding performance for violence detection in surveillance videos. The proposed model receives two spatiotemporal video streams, i.e., RGB frames and optical flows, and involves a new regularized self-supervised learning approach for videos. JOSENet provides improved performance compared to self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, while requiring one-fourth of the number of frames per video segment and a reduced frame rate. The source code and the instructions to reproduce our experiments are available at https://github.com/ispamm/JOSENet.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar has the ability to work 24/7 and 24/7, and has high application value. Propose a new SAR image matching algorithm based on multi class features, mainly using two different types of features: straight lines and regions to enhance the robustness of the matching algorithm; On the basis of using prior knowledge of images, combined with LSD (Line Segment Detector) line detection and template matching algorithm, by analyzing the attribute correlation between line and surface features in SAR images, selecting line and region features in SAR images to match the images, the matching accuracy between SAR images and visible light images is improved, and the probability of matching errors is reduced. The experimental results have verified that this algorithm can obtain high-precision matching results, achieve precise target positioning, and has good robustness to changes in perspective and lighting. The results are accurate and false positives are controllable.</description>

Abstract: Brain tumors present a grave risk to human life, demanding precise and timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Inaccurate identification of brain tumors can significantly diminish life expectancy, underscoring the critical need for precise diagnostic methods. Manual identification of brain tumors within vast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image datasets is arduous and time-consuming. Thus, the development of a reliable deep learning (DL) model is essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ultimately save lives. This study introduces an innovative optimization-based deep ensemble approach employing transfer learning (TL) to efficiently classify brain tumors. Our methodology includes meticulous preprocessing, reconstruction of TL architectures, fine-tuning, and ensemble DL models utilizing weighted optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm-based Weight Optimization (GAWO) and Grid Search-based Weight Optimization (GSWO). Experimentation is conducted on the Figshare Contrast-Enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) brain tumor dataset, comprising 3064 images. Our approach achieves notable accuracy scores, with Xception, ResNet50V2, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2, GAWO, and GSWO attaining 99.42%, 98.37%, 98.22%, 98.26%, 99.71%, and 99.76% accuracy, respectively. Notably, GSWO demonstrates superior accuracy, averaging 99.76\% accuracy across five folds on the Figshare CE-MRI brain tumor dataset. The comparative analysis highlights the significant performance enhancement of our proposed model over existing counterparts. In conclusion, our optimized deep ensemble model exhibits exceptional accuracy in swiftly classifying brain tumors. Furthermore, it has the potential to assist neurologists and clinicians in making accurate and immediate diagnostic decisions.</description>

Abstract: Lung disease is a common health problem in many parts of the world. It is a significant risk to people health and quality of life all across the globe since it is responsible for five of the top thirty leading causes of death. Among them are COVID 19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, to name just a few. It is critical to diagnose lung diseases in their early stages. Several different models including machine learning and image processing have been developed for this purpose. The earlier a condition is diagnosed, the better the patient chances of making a full recovery and surviving into the long term. Thanks to deep learning algorithms, there is significant promise for the autonomous, rapid, and accurate identification of lung diseases based on medical imaging. Several different deep learning strategies, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), vanilla neural networks, visual geometry group based networks (VGG), and capsule networks , are used for the goal of making lung disease forecasts. The standard CNN has a poor performance when dealing with rotated, tilted, or other aberrant picture orientations. As a result of this, within the scope of this study, we have suggested a vision transformer based approach end to end framework for the diagnosis of lung disorders. In the architecture, data augmentation, training of the suggested models, and evaluation of the models are all included. For the purpose of detecting lung diseases such as pneumonia, Covid 19, lung opacity, and others, a specialised Compact Convolution Transformers (CCT) model have been tested and evaluated on datasets such as the Covid 19 Radiography Database. The model has achieved a better accuracy for both its training and validation purposes on the Covid 19 Radiography Database.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmenting a moving needle in ultrasound images is challenging due to the presence of artifacts, noise, and needle occlusion. This task becomes even more demanding in scenarios where data availability is limited. In this paper, we present a novel approach for needle segmentation for 2D ultrasound that combines classical Kalman Filter (KF) techniques with data-driven learning, incorporating both needle features and needle motion. Our method offers three key contributions. First, we propose a compatible framework that seamlessly integrates into commonly used encoder-decoder style architectures. Second, we demonstrate superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art needle segmentation models using our novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based KF-inspired block, achieving a 15\% reduction in pixel-wise needle tip error and an 8\% reduction in length error. Third, to our knowledge we are the first to implement a learnable filter to incorporate non-linear needle motion for improving needle segmentation.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Model-driven Network for MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based methods offer a promising solution to reduce the prolonged scanning time in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While model-driven DL methods have demonstrated convincing results by incorporating prior knowledge into deep networks, further exploration is needed to optimize the integration of diverse priors.. Existing model-driven networks typically utilize linearly stacked unrolled cascades to mimic iterative solution steps in optimization algorithms. However, this approach needs to find a balance between different prior-based regularizers during training, resulting in slower convergence and suboptimal reconstructions. To overcome the limitations, we propose a collaborative model-driven network to maximally exploit the complementarity of different regularizers. We design attention modules to learn both the relative confidence (RC) and overall confidence (OC) for the intermediate reconstructions (IRs) generated by different prior-based subnetworks. RC assigns more weight to the areas of expertise of the subnetworks, enabling precise element-wise collaboration. We design correction modules to tackle bottleneck scenarios where both subnetworks exhibit low accuracy, and they further optimize the IRs based on OC maps. IRs across various stages are concatenated and fed to the attention modules to build robust and accurate confidence maps. Experimental results on multiple datasets showed significant improvements in the final results without additional computational costs. Moreover, the proposed model-driven network design strategy can be conveniently applied to various model-driven methods to improve their performance.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Classification with Distance Regularization for Robust Brain Age Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age is one of the major known risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Detecting AD early is crucial for effective treatment and preventing irreversible brain damage. Brain age, a measure derived from brain imaging reflecting structural changes due to aging, may have the potential to identify AD onset, assess disease risk, and plan targeted interventions. Deep learning-based regression techniques to predict brain age from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have shown great accuracy recently. However, these methods are subject to an inherent regression to the mean effect, which causes a systematic bias resulting in an overestimation of brain age in young subjects and underestimation in old subjects. This weakens the reliability of predicted brain age as a valid biomarker for downstream clinical applications. Here, we reformulate the brain age prediction task from regression to classification to address the issue of systematic bias. Recognizing the importance of preserving ordinal information from ages to understand aging trajectory and monitor aging longitudinally, we propose a novel ORdinal Distance Encoded Regularization (ORDER) loss that incorporates the order of age labels, enhancing the model's ability to capture age-related patterns. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that this framework reduces systematic bias, outperforms state-of-art methods by statistically significant margins, and can better capture subtle differences between clinical groups in an independent AD dataset. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jaygshah/Robust-Brain-Age-Prediction.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Digital Lithological Mapping-Case Studies in Sri Lanka's Mineral Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional manual lithological mapping (MLM) through field surveys are resource-extensive and time-consuming. Digital lithological mapping (DLM), harnessing remotely sensed spectral imaging techniques, provides an effective strategy to streamline target locations for MLM or an efficient alternative to MLM. DLM relies on laboratory-generated generic end-member signatures of minerals for spectral analysis. Thus, the accuracy of DLM may be limited due to the presence of site-specific impurities. A strategy, based on a hybrid machine-learning and signal-processing algorithm, is proposed in this paper to tackle this problem of site-specific impurities. In addition, a soil pixel alignment strategy is proposed here to visualize the relative purity of the target minerals. The proposed methodologies are validated via case studies for mapping of Limestone deposits in Jaffna, Ilmenite deposits in Pulmoddai and Mannar, and Montmorillonite deposits in Murunkan, Sri Lanka. The results of satellite-based spectral imaging analysis were corroborated with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Magnetic Separation (MS) analysis of soil samples collected from those sites via field surveys. There exists a good correspondence between the relative availability of the minerals with the XRD and MS results. In particular, correlation coefficients of 0.8115 and 0.9853 were found for the sites in Pulmoddai and Jaffna respectively.</description>

      <title>SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a crucial preprocessing procedure due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain-specific knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these priors separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more underlying long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, termed Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. We can obtain complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Scan (SSAS) strategy for HSIs, which helps model the information flow in multiple directions in 3-D HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms compared methods. The source code will be available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the human cognitive system, attention is a mechanism that imitates the human cognitive awareness about specific information, amplifying critical details to focus more on the essential aspects of data. Deep learning has employed attention to boost performance for many applications. Interestingly, the same attention design can suit processing different data modalities and can easily be incorporated into large networks. Furthermore, multiple complementary attention mechanisms can be incorporated into one network. Hence, attention techniques have become extremely attractive. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey on attention techniques to guide researchers in employing attention in their deep models. Note that, besides being demanding in terms of training data and computational resources, transformers only cover a single category in self-attention out of the many categories available. We fill this gap and provide an in-depth survey of 50 attention techniques, categorizing them by their most prominent features. We initiate our discussion by introducing the fundamental concepts behind the success of the attention mechanism. Next, we furnish some essentials such as the strengths and limitations of each attention category, describe their fundamental building blocks, basic formulations with primary usage, and applications specifically for computer vision. We also discuss the challenges and general open questions related to attention mechanisms. Finally, we recommend possible future research directions for deep attention.

      <title>UP-CrackNet: Unsupervised Pixel-Wise Road Crack Detection via Adversarial Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, automated methods have been developed to detect cracks more efficiently, accurately, and objectively, with the ultimate goal of replacing conventional manual visual inspection techniques. Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalizability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits satisfactory performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms. Our source code is publicly available at mias.group/UP-CrackNet.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Video Face Restoration: A New Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) on images has significantly progressed over the last several years, while real-world video face restoration (VFR), which is more challenging for more complex face motions such as moving gaze directions and facial orientations involved, remains unsolved. Typical BFR methods are evaluated on privately synthesized datasets or self-collected real-world low-quality face images, which are limited in their coverage of real-world video frames. In this work, we introduced new real-world datasets named FOS with a taxonomy of "Full, Occluded, and Side" faces from mainly video frames to study the applicability of current methods on videos. Compared with existing test datasets, FOS datasets cover more diverse degradations and involve face samples from more complex scenarios, which helps to revisit current face restoration approaches more comprehensively. Given the established datasets, we benchmarked both the state-of-the-art BFR methods and the video super resolution (VSR) methods to comprehensively study current approaches, identifying their potential and limitations in VFR tasks. In addition, we studied the effectiveness of the commonly used image quality assessment (IQA) metrics and face IQA (FIQA) metrics by leveraging a subjective user study. With extensive experimental results and detailed analysis provided, we gained insights from the successes and failures of both current BFR and VSR methods. These results also pose challenges to current face restoration approaches, which we hope stimulate future advances in VFR research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing holographic display technology, we face a unique yet persistent roadblock: the inflexibility of learned holography in adapting to various hardware configurations. This is due to the variances in the complex optical components and system settings in existing holographic displays. Although the emerging learned approaches have enabled rapid and high-quality hologram generation, any alteration in display hardware still requires a retraining of the model. Our work introduces a configurable learned model that interactively computes 3D holograms from RGB-only 2D images for a variety of holographic displays. The model can be conditioned to predefined hardware parameters of existing holographic displays such as working wavelengths, pixel pitch, propagation distance, and peak brightness without having to retrain. In addition, our model accommodates various hologram types, including conventional single-color and emerging multi-color holograms that simultaneously use multiple color primaries in holographic displays. Notably, we enabled our hologram computations to rely on identifying the correlation between depth estimation and 3D hologram synthesis tasks within the learning domain for the first time in the literature. We employ knowledge distillation via a student-teacher learning strategy to streamline our model for interactive performance. Achieving up to a 2x speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art models while consistently generating high-quality 3D holograms with different hardware configurations.</description>
