      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Weakly Compressible Flows Using Galerkin-Boltzmann Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Galerkin-Boltzmann formulation within a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework to solve flow problems in weakly compressible regimes. The Galerkin-Boltzmann equations are discretized with second-order Hermite polynomials in microscopic velocity space, which leads to a first-order conservation law with six equations. Reducing the output dimension makes this equation system particularly well suited for PINNs compared with the widely used D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann velocity space discretizations. We created two distinct neural networks to overcome the scale disparity between the equilibrium and non-equilibrium states in collision terms of the equations. We test the accuracy and performance of the formulation with benchmark problems and solutions for forward and inverse problems with limited data. Our findings show the potential of utilizing the Galerkin-Boltzmann formulation in PINN for weakly compressible flow problems.</description>

      <title>Using lateral dispersion to optimise microfluidic trap array efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic Trap Arrays (MTAs) have proved to be efficient tools for several applications requiring working at the single cell level like cancer understanding and treatment or immune synapse research. Even though several hydrodynamic trapping devices have been already optimised, Two-Dimensionnal (2D) single layer MTAs offering a high trap density remain partially efficient. Indeed, it generally appears that many traps stay empty, even after a long time of injection which can drastically reduce the number of samples available for post-treatment. It has been shown that these unfilled traps were due to the symmetrical nature of the flow around the traps, with a break in symmetry improving capture efficiency. In this work, we use a numerical approach to show that it is possible to generate optimal geometries that significantly improve filling efficiency. This efficiency is associated with an increase in the lateral dispersion of the objects. Then, we show that adding disorder to the layout of the traps is the most interesting solution and may stay efficient independently of the trap array size.</description>

      <title>Unified scaling model for viscosity of crude oil over extended temperature range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscosity of crude oil is an important physical property that largely determines the fluidity of oil and its ability to seep through porous media such as geological rock. Predicting crude oil viscosity requires the development of reliable models that can reproduce viscosity over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Such viscosity models must operate with a set of physical characteristics that are sufficient to describe the viscosity of an extremely complex multi-phase and multi-component system such as crude oil. The present work considers empirical data on the temperature dependence of the viscosity of crude oil samples from various fields in Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Kuwait and the North Sea. For the first time, within the reduced temperature concept and using the universal scaling viscosity model, the viscosity of crude oil can be accurately determined over a wide temperature range: from low temperatures corresponding to the amorphous state to relatively high temperatures, at which all oil fractions appear as melts. A novel methodology for determining the glass transition temperature and the activation energy of viscous flow of crude oil is proposed. A relationship between the parameters of the universal scaling model for viscosity, the API gravity, the fragility index, the glass transition temperature and the activation energy of viscous has been established for the first time. It is shown that the accuracy of the results of the universal scaling model significantly exceeds the accuracy of known empirical equations, including those developed directly to describe the viscosity of petroleum products.</description>

      <title>Mapping Driven Oscillations in the Size of a Bubble to the Dynamics of a Newtonian Particle in a Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear dynamics of driven oscillations in the size of a spherical bubble are mapped to the dynamics of a Newtonian particle in a potential within the incompressible liquid regime. The compressible liquid regime, which is important during the bubble's sonic collapse, is approached adiabatically. This new framework naturally distinguishes between the two time scales involved in the non-linear oscillations of a bubble. It also explains the experimentally observed sharp rebound of the bubble upon collapse. Guided by this new vantage point, we develop analytical approximations for several key aspects of bubble motion. First, we formulate a tensile strength law that integrates the bubble's ideal gas behavior with a general polytropic index. Next, we derive an acoustic energy dissipation formula for the bubble's sonic collapse, dependent solely on the bubble's collapse radii and velocity. Finally, we establish a straightforward physical criterion for Bjerknes force reversal, governed by the driving pressure, ambient pressure and tensile strength.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Turbulence at a Forest Edge: A Vorticity Budget Analysis around a Canopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vorticity is a key characteristic of flow patterns that determine wildland fire behavior, frontal evolution, and wind-canopy interaction. Investigating the role of vorticity in the flow fields around vegetation can help us better understand fire-atmosphere feedback and the influences of vegetation on this feedback. In modeling vorticity, ``perhaps the greatest knowledge gap exists in understanding which terms in the vorticity equation dominate [...] (and) when one or the other might dominate" (Potter, 2012). In this study, we investigate the role of vorticity in boundary layer dynamics and canopy/forest edge effects using HIGRAD/FIRETEC, a three-dimensional, two-phase transport model that conserves mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species. A vorticity transport equation was derived and discretized. Simulations were performed over a cuboidal homogeneous canopy surrounded by surface vegetation. This derivation led to the discovery of a drag tilting and stretching term, which shows that gradients in the aerodynamic drag of the vegetation, tied to heterogeneities in surface area-to-volume ratio, play an important role in the generation of vorticity. Results from the vorticity budget analysis show that this term contributes significantly in the areas where these gradients are present, namely the edges of the canopy.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Turbulence at a Forest Edge: Comparing Sub-filter Scale Turbulence Models in Simulations of Flow over a Canopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wildfires, atmospheric turbulence plays a major role in the transfer of turbulent kinetic energy. Understanding how turbulence feeds back into a dynamical system is important, down to the varying small scales of fuel structures (i.e. pine needles, grass). Large eddy simulations (LES) are a common way of numerically representing turbulence. The Smagorinsky model (1963) serves as one of the most studied sub-grid scale representations in LES. In this investigation, the Smagorinsky model was implemented in HIGRAD/FIRETEC, LANL's coupled fire-atmosphere model. The Smagorinsky turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was compared to FIRETEC's 1.5-order TKE eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model, known as the Linn turbulence model. This was done in simulations of flow over flat terrain with a homogeneous, cuboidal canopy in the center of the domain. Examinations of the modeled vertical TKE profile and turbulent statistics at the leading edge, and throughout the canopy, show that the Smagorinsky model provides comparable results to that of the original closure model posed in FIRETEC.</description>

      <title>Rough surfaces in under-explored surface morphology space and their implications on roughness modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of the rough-wall channel, focusing on roughness with high $k_{rms}/k_a$ statistics but small to negative $Sk$ statistics, and we study the implications of this new dataset on rough-wall modelling. Here, $k_{rms}$ is the root-mean-square, $k_a$ is the first order moment of roughness height, and $Sk$ is the skewness. The effects of packing density, skewness and arrangement of roughness elements on mean streamwise velocity, equivalent roughness height ($z_0$) and Reynolds and dispersive stresses have been studied. We demonstrate that two-point correlation lengths of roughness height statistics play an important role in characterizing rough surfaces with identical moments of roughness height but different arrangements of roughness elements. Analysis of the present as well as historical data suggests that the task of rough-wall modelling is to identify geometric parameters that distinguish the rough surfaces within the calibration dataset. We demonstrate a novel feature selection procedure to determine these parameters. Further, since there is not a finite set of roughness statistics that distinguish between all rough surfaces, we argue that obtaining a universal rough-wall model for making equivalent sand-grain roughness ($k_s$) predictions would be challenging, and that each rough-wall model would have its applicable range. This motivates the development of group-based rough-wall models. The applicability of multi-variate polynomial regression and feedforward neural networks for building such group-based rough-wall models using the selected features has been shown.</description>

      <title>Mixing in viscoelastic fluids using elastic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of elastic turbulence on mixing {of a scalar concentration field} within a viscoelastic fluid in a two-dimensional Taylor-Couette geometry using numerical solutions of the Oldroyd-B model. The flow state is determined through the secondary-flow order parameter indicating that the transition at the critical Weissenberg number $\text{Wi}_c$ is subcritical. When {starting in the turbulent state and subsequently} lowering the Weissenberg number, a weakly-chaotic flow occurs below $\text{Wi}_c$. Advection in both {the turbulent and weakly-chaotic} flow states induces mixing, which we illustrate by the time evolution of the standard deviation of the solute concentration from the uniform distribution. In particular, in the elastic turbulent state mixing is strong and we quantify it by the mixing rate, the mixing time, and the mixing efficiency. All three quantities follow scaling laws. Importantly, we show that the order parameter is strongly correlated to the mixing rate and hence is also a good indication of mixing within the fluid.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional generative adversarial networks for turbulent flow estimation from wall measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different types of neural networks have been used to solve the flow sensing problem in turbulent flows, namely to estimate velocity in wall-parallel planes from wall measurements. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are among the most promising methodologies, due to their more accurate estimations and better perceptual quality. This work tackles this flow sensing problem in the vicinity of the wall, addressing for the first time the reconstruction of the entire three-dimensional (3-D) field with a single network, i.e. a 3-D GAN. With this methodology, a single training and prediction process overcomes the limitation presented by the former approaches based on the independent estimation of wall-parallel planes. The network is capable of estimating the 3-D flow field with a level of error at each wall-normal distance comparable to that reported from wall-parallel plane estimations and at a lower training cost in terms of computational resources. The direct full 3-D reconstruction also unveils a direct interpretation in terms of coherent structures. It is shown that the accuracy of the network depends directly on the wall footprint of each individual turbulent structure. It is observed that wall-attached structures are predicted more accurately than wall-detached ones, especially at larger distances from the wall. Among wall-attached structures, smaller sweeps are reconstructed better than small ejections, while large ejections are reconstructed better than large sweeps as a consequence of their more intense footprint.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian Vortex Method on Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an Eulerian vortex method based on the theory of flow maps to simulate the complex vortical motions of incompressible fluids. Central to our method is the novel incorporation of the flow-map transport equations for line elements, which, in combination with a bi-directional marching scheme for flow maps, enables the high-fidelity Eulerian advection of vorticity variables. The fundamental motivation is that, compared to impulse $\mathbf{m}$, which has been recently bridged with flow maps to encouraging results, vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ promises to be preferable for its numerically stability and physical interpretability. To realize the full potential of this novel formulation, we develop a new Poisson solving scheme for vorticity-to-velocity reconstruction that is both efficient and able to accurately handle the coupling near solid boundaries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a range of vortex simulation examples, including leapfrog vortices, vortex collisions, cavity flow, and the formation of complex vortical structures due to solid-fluid interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for simulating ink as a particle-laden flow using particle flow maps. Our method addresses the limitations of existing flow-map techniques, which struggle with dissipative forces like viscosity and drag, thereby extending the application scope from solving the Euler equations to solving the Navier-Stokes equations with accurate viscosity and laden-particle treatment. Our key contribution lies in a coupling mechanism for two particle systems, coupling physical sediment particles and virtual flow-map particles on a background grid by solving a Poisson system. We implemented a novel path integral formula to incorporate viscosity and drag forces into the particle flow map process. Our approach enables state-of-the-art simulation of various particle-laden flow phenomena, exemplified by the bulging and breakup of suspension drop tails, torus formation, torus disintegration, and the coalescence of sedimenting drops. In particular, our method delivered high-fidelity ink diffusion simulations by accurately capturing vortex bulbs, viscous tails, fractal branching, and hierarchical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exascale computing enables high-fidelity simulations of chemically reactive flows in practical geometries and conditions, and paves the way for valuable insights that can optimize combustion processes, ultimately reducing emissions and improving fuel combustion efficiency. However, this requires software that can fully leverage the capabilities of current high performance computing systems. The paper introduces nekCRF, a high-order reactive low Mach flow solver specifically designed for this purpose. Its capabilities and efficiency are showcased on the pre-exascale system JUWELS Booster, a GPU-based supercomputer at the J\"{u}lich Supercomputing Centre including a validation across diverse cases of varying complexity.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of wave-propelled capillary spinners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a millimetric body is placed atop a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outward propagating waves with an associated momentum flux. Prior work has shown that isolated chiral objects, referred to as spinners, can thus rotate steadily in response to their self-generated wavefield. Here, we consider the case of two co-chiral spinners held at a fixed spacing from one another but otherwise free to interact hydrodynamically through their shared fluid substrate. Two identical spinners are able to synchronize their rotation, with their equilibrium phase difference sensitive to their spacing and initial conditions, and even cease to rotate when the coupling becomes sufficiently strong. Non-identical spinners can also find synchrony provided their intrinsic differences are not too disparate. A hydrodynamic wave model of the spinner interaction is proposed, recovering all salient features of the experiment. In all cases, the spatially periodic nature of the capillary wave coupling is directly reflected in the emergent equilibrium behaviors.</description>

      <title>The characteristics of the meandering effect in a stratified wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradual suppression of the vertical motions and the emergence of large-scale horizontal structures are characteristics of a stratified wake flow. We isolate the resulting wake meandering from the stationary velocity, i.e., the velocity without meandering, by utilizing direct numerical simulations covering Reynolds numbers $Re_B=UD/\nu$ between $[10 000, 50 000]$ and Froude number $Fr_B=U_B/ND$ between $[2, 50]$ ($U_B$ is the freestream velocity, $D$ is the characteristic length scale, and $N$ is the buoyancy frequency). The meandering range is growing in the horizontal direction as the wake width, but decreases in the vertical direction, opposite to the wake height. The meandering, especially in the horizontal direction, leads to the dispersion of the instantaneous velocity and layered flow structures. Thus, the mean velocity profile deviates from the assumption of two-dimensional self-similarity in the late wake. Due to the distortion of the mean velocity profile, the superposition of the meandering to the stationary velocity is non-trivial. The scaling of the width and the height transitions at different points, and the scaling of the velocity deficit is further more complicated. Through theoretical analysis, we obtain and verify the momentum flux equation. We can accurately measure the impact of the meandering on the scaling of the lengths, and also the scaling of the velocity deficit.</description>

      <title>Momentum, energy and vorticity balances in deep-water surface gravity waves</title>

Abstract: The particle trajectories in irrotational, incompressible and inviscid deep-water surface gravity waves are open, leading to a net drift in the direction of wave propagation commonly referred to as the Stokes Drift, which is responsible for catalysing surface wave-induced mixing in the ocean and transporting marine debris. A balance between phase-averaged momentum density, kinetic energy density and vorticity for irrotational, monochromatic and periodic two-dimensional water waves is derived by working directly within the Lagrangian reference frame, which tracks particle trajectories as a function of their labels and time. This balance should be expected as all three of these quantities are conserved following particles in this system. Vorticity in particular is always conserved along particles in two-dimensional inviscid flow, and as such even in its absence it is the value of the vorticity which fundamentally sets the drift, which in the Lagrangian frame is identified as the phase-averaged momentum density of the system. A relationship between the drift and the geometric mean water level of particles is found at the surface and applications for potential new ways of inferring drift are discussed. Finally, an example of an initially quiescent fluid driven by a wavelike pressure disturbance is considered, showing how the net momentum and energy from the surface disturbance transfer to the wave field, recognizing the source of the mean Lagrangian drift as the net momentum required to generate an irrotational surface wave by any conservative force.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based resolvent analysis of non-stationary flows</title>

Abstract: This work introduces a formulation of resolvent analysis that uses wavelet transforms rather than Fourier transforms in time. Under this formulation, resolvent analysis may extend to turbulent flows with non-stationary mean states; the optimal resolvent modes are augmented with a temporal dimension and are able to encode the time-transient trajectories that are most amplified by the linearised Navier-Stokes equations. We first show that the wavelet- and Fourier-based resolvent analyses give equivalent results for statistically-stationary flow by applying them to turbulent channel flow. We then use wavelet-based resolvent analysis to study the transient growth mechanism in the near-wall region of turbulent channel flow by windowing the resolvent operator in time and frequency. The computed principal resolvent response mode, i.e. the velocity field optimally amplified by the linearised dynamics of the flow, exhibits the Orr mechanism, supporting the claim that this mechanism is key to linear transient energy growth. We also apply this method to non-stationary parallel shear flows such as an oscillating boundary layer, and three-dimensional channel flow in which a sudden spanwise pressure gradient perturbs a fully-developed turbulent channel flow. In both cases, wavelet-based resolvent analysis yields modes that are sensitive to the changing mean profile of the flow. For the oscillating boundary layer, wavelet-based resolvent analysis produces oscillating principal forcing and response modes that peak at times and wall-normal locations associated with high turbulent activity. For the three-dimensional turbulent channel flow, the resolvent modes gradually realign themselves with the mean flow as it deviates.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Model for Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic limit of a discrete kinetic equation is intrinsically connected with the symmetry of the lattices used in construction of a discrete velocity model. On mixed lattices composed of standard lattices the sixth-order (and higher) moment is often not isotropic and thus they are insufficient to ensure correct imposition of the hydrodynamic moments. This makes the task of developing lattice Boltzmann model for transonic flows quite challenging. We address this by decoupling the physical space lattice from the velocity space lattice to construct a lattice Boltzmann model with very high isotropy. The model is entirely on-lattice like the isothermal models, achieves a Mach number of two with only $81$ discrete velocities, and admits a simple generalization of equilibrium distribution used in isothermal equilibrium. We also present a number of realistic benchmark problems to show that the lattice Boltzmann model with a limited number of velocities is not only feasible for transonic flow but is also quite simple and efficient like its subsonic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advection-dominated problems are commonly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and a wide range of industrial processes. For these problems, linear approximation methods (proper orthogonal decomposition and reduced basis method) are not suitable, as the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay is slow, leading to inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models. There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural-network shift augmented transformation technique, that employs automatic-shit detection and detects the optimal non-linear transformation of the full-order model solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$. We exploit a deep-learning framework to derive parameter-dependent bijective mapping between the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. It consists of two neural networks, 1) ShiftNet, to employ automatic-shift detection by learning the shift-operator, which finds the optimal shifts for numerous snapshots of the full-order solution manifold, to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, and 2) InterpNet, which learns the reference configuration and can reconstruct the field values of the same, for each shifted grid distribution. We construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear subspaces and employ automatic-shift detection for predictions. We test our methodology on advection-dominated problems, such as 1D travelling waves, 2D isentropic convective vortex and 2D two-phase flow test cases. This work leads to the development of the complete NNsPOD-ROM algorithm for model reduction of advection-dominated problems, comprising both offline-online stages.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>
