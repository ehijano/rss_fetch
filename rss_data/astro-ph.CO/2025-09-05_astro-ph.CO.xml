      <title>The Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere cosmic shear project V: Constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from 270 million galaxies across 13,000 deg$^2$ of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx 0.3\sigma$ in the $S_8, \Omega_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Neutrino-Induced Phase Shift in the 21-cm Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase shift that free-streaming neutrinos imprint on the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn, computing for the first time its effect on both density- and velocity-induced acoustic oscillations. Neutrinos are known to generate a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon plasma before recombination, a signature already detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as well as the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) extracted from galaxy surveys. We show that in the 21-cm signal this phase shift is distinct from that observed in the CMB and BAO spectra, exhibiting a characteristic mode and redshift dependence arising from the additional contribution of the so-called velocity acoustic oscillations (VAOs), sourced by the baryon-dark matter relative velocities. Our results establish the phase of acoustic oscillations in the 21-cm spectrum as a promising new avenue for probing free-streaming light relics at cosmic dawn, complementary to existing CMB and BAO measurements.</description>

      <title>Spectral siren cosmology from gravitational-wave observations in GWTC-4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave standard sirens offer a promising avenue for cosmological inference, particularly in measuring the expansion history of the universe. Traditionally, bright sirens require an electromagnetic counterpart to determine the redshift of the emission source while dark sirens rely on the presence of complete galaxy catalogs over large sky regions. Spectral sirens, using GW data alone, can circumvent these limitations by leveraging features in the mass distribution of compact binaries. With the recent release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4 (GWTC-4.0), the number of significant binary black hole (BBH) merger candidates has increased to 153, enabling more robust population studies and cosmological constraints. This work builds upon previous spectral siren analyses by analyzing the latest BBH observations with parametric and non-parametric models. In particular, we consider a parametric approach using the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks models as well as a more flexible non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes. We find broad consistency in the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ constraints across models. Our most constraining result is from the Gaussian Process model, which, combined with the GW170817 bright siren measurement, results in $H_0 = 69^{+7}_{-6} \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, a 10% precision measurement. For the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks we find fractional uncertainties of 17% and 13% respectively.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of PAHs as a Tracer of Anomalous Microwave Emission Using DIRBE Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use archival data from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) to map the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3 $\mu$m emission feature and analyze its correlation with AME in 98 compact sources identified by the Planck collaboration. We find that while FIR thermal dust emission continues to be a better tracer of AME in most of the considered regions, 17% of the AME sources are better correlated with emission from small PAHs as traced by DIRBE. Furthermore, of the 27 sources which were identified as highly significant AME detections in the Planck analysis, 37% prefer PAHs as an AME tracer. Further work is required to understand to what extent local interstellar conditions are affecting PAH emission mechanisms and to reveal the underlying carriers of AME.</description>

      <title>Nearly Full-Sky Low-Multipole CMB Temperature Anisotropy: I. Foreground Cleaned Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are often limited by foreground contamination. Foreground cleaning is performed either in harmonic or pixel space after data cuts have excluded sky areas of strong contamination. We present a nearly full-sky CMB temperature map with only 1% of pixels masked. To derive this map, we make use of six full-sky template maps at foreground-dominated frequencies from different experiments smoothed to $1^\circ$ and rely on the combination of these weighted maps to trace the morphology of foreground contamination. We do not impose any spectral index constraints, but only fit for template amplitudes at each target frequency. We clean WMAP and Planck maps at a set of target frequencies and conduct quality tests at the level of the maps, pixel histograms and power spectra to select four CMB maps that are cleaned with negligible foreground contamination and only 1% masked pixels and no inpainting. We recommend use of these cleaned CMB maps for low multipole ($\ell &lt; 30$) studies.</description>

      <title>Nearly Full-Sky Low-Multipole CMB Temperature Anisotropy: II. Angular Power Spectra and Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a CMB temperature power spectrum measurement at large angular scales from WMAP and Planck maps that were cleaned of foregrounds using a template-based approach described in a companion paper. We recover essentially the full-sky CMB information at multipoles $\ell&lt;30$ with only 1% of pixels near the Galactic plane masked and no inpainting. Notable features continue to appear: (a) a low quadrupole power compared to the best-fit Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM spectrum at $2.2\sigma$, (b) a dip in the range $20 \le \ell \le 27$, and (c) an overall $\ell&lt;30$ power level low of the $\Lambda$CDM prediction derived from higher multipole moments. Given the different methodology from previous analyses and the nearly full-sky solution presented here, these features do not plausibly arise from foreground contamination, systematic errors, masking, or mode-mixing. Our overall $\ell&lt;30$ amplitude constraint is consistent with published WMAP (77% sky fraction) and Planck (86%) results at $1.2\sigma$ and $0.6\sigma$, respectively, accounting for the improvement in statistical precision. We present a new $\ell&lt;30$ likelihood for use with the Cobaya package. Parameter constraints from joint fits with the higher-multipole Planck data are consistent with the published Planck results, for example we find $H_0=67.35\pm0.54$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in a joint $\Lambda$CDM fit.</description>

      <title>Nearly full-sky low-multipole CMB temperature anisotropy: III. CMB anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unexpected features have been observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature on large scales. We revisit these CMB anomalies using new foreground-cleaned CMB temperature maps derived in a companion paper from WMAP and Planck data, which are tailored to low-resolution analysis and require only minimal masking of $1\%$ of the sky. These maps allow us to assess the impact of foreground-cleaning methods and the choice of sky cut on the significance of five commonly studied CMB anomalies. We find a notable impact of the choice of galactic mask on the significance of two anomalies: the significance of the low real-space correlation function and of the local-variance asymmetry reduces from $\sim3\sigma$ for the Planck common mask with $26\%$ masked fraction to $\sim2\sigma$ for the $1\%$ mask. We find good agreement between the two sky cuts for the low northern variance, $\sim3\sigma$, and the parity asymmetry, $\sim2\sigma$. For the quadrupole-octopole alignment, we find good agreement between the $1\%$-mask result and the full-sky results in the literature, $\sim3\sigma$. Thus using a larger fraction of the sky enabled by improved foreground cleaning reduces the significance of two commonly studied CMB anomalies. Overall, for an alternative physical model to be convincingly favored over $\Lambda$CDM with statistically-isotropic Gaussian fluctuations, it would need to explain multiple CMB anomalies, or better describe some other type of measurement in addition to a CMB anomaly.</description>

      <title>DECADE+DES Y3 Weak Lensing Mass Map: A 13,000 deg$^2$ View of Cosmic Structure from 270 Million Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest galaxy weak lensing mass map of the late-time Universe, reconstructed from 270 million galaxies in the DECADE and DES Year 3 datasets, covering 13,000 square degrees. We validate the map through systematic tests against observational conditions (depth, seeing, etc.), finding the map is statistically consistent with no contamination. The large area covered by the mass map makes it a well-suited tool for cosmological analyses, cross-correlation studies and the identification of large-scale structure features. We demonstrate its potential by detecting cosmic filaments directly from the mass map for the first time and validating them through their association with galaxy clusters selected using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from Planck and ACT DR6.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.</description>

      <title>ZTF SNe Ia DR2: Towards cosmology-grade ZTF supernova light curves using scene modeling photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is conducting a wide-field survey of the northern sky in three optical bands and the collaboration cosmology working group has released 3628 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during its first 2.5 years of operation. This "ZTF SN Ia DR2" sample is the largest SN Ia dataset to date.
  Fully exploiting this dataset to improve understanding of the properties of dark energy requires a photometric accuracy of O(0.1%). This can be achieved using Scene Modeling Photometry (SMP), which is optimal to extract a transient signal (SN) from a complex background (its host), while ensuring a common flux estimator with nearby stars used as calibration reference. In this paper, we present the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision and accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves.
  We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we have identified a new sensor effect, dubbed "pocket-effect", which distorts the Point Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to non-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect requires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel level, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light curve releases to date -- both from forced photometry and scene modelling preventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference.
  Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch and color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag shift in color. This assess the robustness of results presented as part of the the ZTF SN Ia DR2 release. The absolute calibration however shifts by 90 mmag. A reprocessing of the full ZTF SN Ia DR2 dataset using the SMP method is currently in progress.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a renormalization-free framework for modeling galaxy bias based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction. The numerical implementation is released as the open-source Python package https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) with electromagnetic counterparts (EMc) offer a novel approach to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens, enabling $H_0$ measurements by combining GW-derived distances with EM-derived redshifts. Host galaxy identification is essential for redshift determination but remains challenging due to poor GW sky localization and uncertainties in EMc models. To overcome these limitations, we exploit the ultra-high-precision localization ($\Delta \Omega_s \sim 10^{-4} \, \text{deg}^2$) with a space-based GW detector network (LISA-Taiji-TianQin), which permits unique host identification solely from GW signals. We integrate five massive black hole binary (MBHB) population models and two galaxy number density models to compute the redshift horizon for host galaxy identification and evaluate $H_0$ constraints. We find that (1) The network enhances localization by several orders of magnitude compared to single detectors; (2) The identification horizon reaches $z\sim 1.2$ for specific MBHBs in the most accurate localization case; (3) The population model choice critically impacts the outcomes: the most refined population models yield to independent EMc identification rate of 0.6-1 $\text{yr}^{-1}$ with $H_0$ constraints $&lt; 1\%$ fractional uncertainty, the less refined models lead to the rate $&lt;0.1\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $1-2\%$ uncertainty on $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Cosmography via stellar archaeology of low-redshift early-type galaxies from SDSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic chronometers offer a model-independent way to trace the expansion history of the Universe via the dating of passively evolving objects. This enables testing the validity of cosmological models without concrete assumptions of their energy content. The main goal of this work is to derive model-independent constraints on the Hubble parameter up to $z \sim 0.4$ using stellar ages from the fitting of Lick index absorption lines in passively evolving galaxies. Contrary to recent related works that rely on finite differences to obtain a discrete measurement of the expansion of the Universe at an average redshift, our goal is to perform a cosmographic fit of $H(z)$ in terms of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. We carefully select spectra of massive and passively evolving galaxies from the SDSS Legacy Survey. After applying a stacking procedure to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio, the strength of Lick indices is fit using two stellar population models (TMJ and Knowles) to derive stellar population parameters. A cosmographic fit to the stellar ages is performed, which in turn enables the sampling of the Hubble parameter within the considered redshift range. The baseline result comes from using the TMJ-modelled ages, and it yields a value of $H_0 = 70.0^{+4.1}_{-7.6} \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ for the Hubble constant, where uncertainties refer only to the statistical treatment of the data. The sampling of the Hubble parameter at $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.35$ is competitive with discreet model-independent measurements from the literature. We finally draw attention to an unexpected oscillating pattern in a number of critical indices with respect to redshift, which translates into a similar behaviour in the $t-z$ relations. These features have never been discussed before, although they are present in previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Axion-Photon Conversion In Magnetized Universe: Impact On The Global 21-cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reported anomalous global 21-cm signal $(T_{21})$ from the cosmic dawn era by Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionisation Signature (EDGES) could hint towards new physics beyond the standard model. The resonant conversion of the axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in the presence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) could be a viable solution. However, the strength of the PMFs can change over the time as they can decay by ambipolar diffusion and turbulent decay. Consequently, PMFs can dissipate their energy into the intergalactic medium (IGM), which can alter the global 21-cm signal. We simultaneously consider both magnetic heating of IGM and resonant conversion of ALPs to derive physically motivated upper bounds on the coupling strength $(g_{a\gamma})$ and magnetic field strength $(B_n)$. Our findings report that, for $B_n= 0.1\,\rm nG$, $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim (3.6\times 10^{-4}-3\times 10^{-3})$ is required to recover standard $T_{21}=-156\,\rm mK$, while a deeper absorption of $-500$ mK pushes the upper bound to $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim (6.5\times 10^{-4}-5.7\times 10^{-3})$.</description>

      <title>Fractal Properties of the Cosmic Web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic web is one of the most complex systems in nature, consisting of galaxies and clusters of galaxies joined by filaments and walls, leaving large empty regions called cosmic voids. The most common method of describing the web is a correlation function and its derivative, the fractal function. In this paper, I provide a review of the fractal properties of the cosmic web from the observational point of view within the Newtonian concordance $\Lambda$CDM Universe framework. I give a brief history of fractal studies of the Universe. I then describe the derivation of the fractal function from angular and spatial distributions of galaxies and their relations. Correlation functions are not sensitive to the shape of the galaxy distribution. To improve our quantitative understanding of properties of the web, statistics must be used which are sensitive to the pattern of the web.</description>

      <title>GWTC-4.0: Constraints on the Cosmic Expansion Rate and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $\Xi_0$, we estimate $\Xi_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Spectra for $P_{1D}$ Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Hawking tunneling radiation with thermodynamic pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation elucidates black holes as quantum thermodynamic systems, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between general relativity and quantum mechanics through particle emission phenomena. While conventional theoretical frameworks predominantly focus on classical spacetime configurations, recent advancements in Extended Phase Space thermodynamics have redefined cosmological parameters (such as the $\Lambda$-term) as dynamic variables. Notably, the thermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes has been successfully extended to incorporate thermodynamic pressure $P$. Within this extended phase space framework, although numerous intriguing physical phenomena have been identified, the tunneling mechanism of particles incorporating pressure and volume remains unexplored. This study investigates Hawking radiation through particle tunneling in Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes within the extended phase space, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is introduced via a dynamic cosmological constant $\Lambda$. By employing semi-classical tunneling calculations with self-gravitation corrections, we demonstrate that emission probabilities exhibit a direct correlation with variations in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Significantly, the radiation spectrum deviates from pure thermality, aligning with unitary quantum evolution while maintaining consistency with standard phase space results. Moreover, through thermodynamic analysis, we have verified that the emission rate of particles is related to the difference in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the emitted particles before and after they tunnel through the potential barrier. These findings establish particle tunneling as a unified probe of quantum gravitational effects in black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Systematic effect induced by misalignment in a Reflective Polarization Modulator for CMB, and application to the LiteBIRD case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The LiteBIRD mission aims to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented precision, targeting the detection of primordial B modes and a precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. A central component of LiteBIRD are the polarization modulators based on Half-Wave Plates (HWP). In this work, we investigate systematic effects caused by a small, constant misalignment between the reflective HWP's rotation axis and optical axis, which mimics a wedge-like effect. This effect can introduce HWP-synchronous pointing errors, biasing polarization measurements and generating spurious B modes. Using the LiteBIRD simulation framework, we implement this wedge-like misalignment in time-ordered data and evaluate its impact on reconstructed maps and angular power spectra. Our results show that the contamination predominantly mimics lensing B modes rather than primordial tensor modes, and its impact is reduced when increasing the number of detectors. By estimating the resulting error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we set constraints on the maximum allowable wedge angle to ensure systematic effects remain below mission requirements. This study emphasizes the critical importance of precise optical alignment in CMB polarization experiments. Future work will address the additional effects of time-dependent HWP wobbling and more realistic scenarios with non-ideal detector pairs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we initiate a broad study of some central properties of the string axiverse arising from Calabi-Yau compactifications of the perturbative heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory. Along this road toward a heterotic axiverse, we characterize the generic structure of the axion mass spectrum and the effective couplings of the non-QCD heterotic axions to Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and discuss their implications for cosmology, particle phenomenology, and the QCD axion quality problem. We also provide arguments that the heterotic axion masses are bounded from below much more strongly than, for example, the spectrum in type IIB compactifications.</description>

      <title>Testing Seesaw and Leptogenesis via Gravitational Waves: Majorana versus Dirac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the B-L gauge extension of the Standard Model that the Dirac seesaw mechanism with thermal Leptogenesis can be tested using the stochastic gravitational background (SGWB) emanating from a network of cosmic strings when B-L symmetry is broken. With right-handed neutrino mass lighter than the typical scale of grand unification, the B-L symmetry protecting the right-handed neutrinos leads to constraints on the Yukawa couplings for both Dirac and Majorana scenarios. Estimating the predicted gravitational wave background we find that future space-borne missions could probe the range concerning thermal Dirac Leptogenesis. In a comparative analysis between such probes of gravitational wave sourced from cosmic strings in Dirac and Majorana Leptogenesis in the B-L extension, based on the energy scales of the Leptogenesis, for instance, GW detectors will be able to probe the scale of Dirac Leptogenesis upto $ 10^{9}$ GeV, while for Majorana Leptogenesis it would be upto $ 10^{12}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Unveiling horizons in quantum critical collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical gravitational collapse offers a unique window into regimes of arbitrarily high curvature, culminating in a naked singularity arising from smooth initial data -- thus providing a dynamical counterexample to weak cosmic censorship. Near the critical regime, quantum effects from the collapsing matter are expected to intervene before full quantum gravity resolves the singularity. Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment has so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical analysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing on explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we analytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive answers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization effects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum corrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating both classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap, signaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I behavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic censorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with non-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes. Along the way, we uncover intriguing and previously underexplored features of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Critical Collapse Abhors a Naked Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical critical collapse yields naked singularities from smooth initial data, challenging cosmic censorship and shaping the spectrum of primordial black holes. We show that one-loop vacuum polarization near the threshold alters this outcome. In analytically tractable Einstein-scalar critical spacetimes, regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like state whose stress tensor supplies a universal quantum growing mode. Its backreaction competes with the classical unstable mode, producing a shift of the critical point and a finite mass gap at the new threshold, thereby enforcing horizon formation even under arbitrary fine-tuning. In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters exponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass tail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum. These results provide the first consistent quantum treatment of critical collapse, offering definitive predictions for several long-standing problems.</description>

Abstract: We present constraints on low mass dark matter-electron scattering and absorption interactions using a SuperCDMS high-voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detector. Data were taken underground in the NEXUS facility located at Fermilab with an overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent. The experiment benefits from the minimizing of luminescence from the printed circuit boards in the detector holder used in all previous HVeV studies. A blind analysis of $6.1\,\mathrm{g\cdot days}$ of exposure produces exclusion limits for dark matter-electron scattering cross-sections for masses as low as $1\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$, as well as on the photon-dark photon mixing parameter and the coupling constant between axion-like particles and electrons for particles with masses $&gt;1.2\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ probed via absorption processes.</description>

      <title>Light nuclei under magnetic field and the lithium problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of the magnetic field on the proton and neutron density distributions of the nuclei 2H, 3H, 3He, which are calculated ab initio, and the 6Li nucleus in the alpha-cluster model. It is found that the asymptotic exponential damp of the probability density at long distance is modified, and that the linear component of the exponent with respect to the magnetic field yields the leading contribution, while those of the second derivative and the confining magnetic force are subleading. Due to the linear dependence of the exponent, fluctuating magnetic fields always enhance the tunneling rate, i.e. the cross section of low energy nuclear reactions which occur at large separation across the Coulomb barrier. While this mechanism cannot suppress the production of 7Be in the early Universe, it has the potential to resolve the lithium problem either by increasing the reaction rate of 7Be + p -&gt; 8B at the bigbang nucleosynthesis era if the magnetic field at this time was sufficiently strong, or by correcting the systematically enlarged 4He + 3He -&gt; 7Be cross section by the unwanted magnetic field generated in the nuclear experimental setup, which was so far used as the input of the simulation of bigbang nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Confirming lensed-quasar candidates with DESI and P200 spectroscopy I. 14 lensed quasars and 8 lensed galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lensed quasars are powerful probes of cosmology, the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and the distribution of dark matter. We cross-match 1,724 previously identified candidates from HSC, KiDS, and the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS) with DESI DR1, obtaining 937 DESI spectra for 677 unique systems. Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations from the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three lensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii of 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11 high-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling, and have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius spans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of the 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only one quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the other image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report eight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses. These results provide valuable targets for follow-up studies and underscore the efficiency of wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as DESI in confirming gravitationally lensed quasars and galaxies.</description>

      <title>A large thermal energy reservoir in the nascent intracluster medium at a redshift of 4.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas ($\boldsymbol{\gtrsim10^7\,\rm}\mathrm{K}$), forming the intracluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic electrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long wavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and pressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three systems at or above $z\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making the time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations of this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular gas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$, corresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal implies a thermal energy of $\mathbf{\sim 10^{61}\,\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding the possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to current theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of thermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in unrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters emerged at $\mathbf{z \sim 2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17836v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we evaluate whether the gravitational wave background recently observed by a number of different pulsar timing arrays could be due to merging primordial supermassive black hole binaries. We find that for homogeneously distributed primordial black holes this possibility is inconsistent with strong cosmological and astrophysical constraints on their total abundance. If the distribution exhibits some clustering, however, the merger rate will, in general, be enhanced, opening the window for a consistent interpretation of the pulsar timing array data in terms of merging primordial black holes, if $\mu$-distortion constraints associated with the formation mechanism can be evaded.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave and particle emission from a cosmic string loop: local case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using lattice field simulations of the Abelian-Higgs model, we characterize the simultaneous emission of (scalar and gauge) particles and gravitational waves (GWs) by local string loops. We use {\it network} loops created in a phase transition, and {\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing straight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both particle and GW emission, on time scales $\Delta t_{\rm dec} \propto L^p$, where $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \simeq 2$ for artificial loops and $p \simeq 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission, we find $p \simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length, artificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger loops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more realistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by our data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\text{c} \lesssim 6000$. Our results indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be greatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have reported a compelling evidence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. However, the origin of the signal remains undetermined, largely because its spectrum is bluer for an astrophysical source and can be explained by cosmological models. In this letter, we revisit the frequency- and Fourier-domain analysis of the signal by deriving theoretically accurate expressions for the Fourier bin variances and correlation of pulsar timing residuals, and demonstrate their outstanding agreement with point source astrophysical simulations. In contrast, we show that a common power law (or a diagonal covariance approximation) traditionally used to interpret a stochastic gravitational wave background signal is generally faced with systematic errors, one of which is the illusion of a bluer signal. This hints at a conservative solution, supportive of an astrophysical source, to the observed correlated common spectrum process in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Kernel dependence of the Gaussian Process reconstruction of late Universe expansion history</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss model-independent reconstruction of the expansion history of the late Universe. We use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct the evolution of various cosmological parameters such as Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and deceleration parameter $q(z)$ using observational data to train the GPR model. We look at the GP reconstruction of these parameters using stationary and non-stationary kernel functions. We examine the effect of the choice of kernel functions on the reconstructions. We find that using non-stationary kernels such as lower-order polynomial kernels is a better choice for the reconstruction if the training data set is noisy (such as $H(z)$ data) as shown by the log marginal likelihood analysis. We also look at the reconstructions of the derivatives of $H(z)$ and study the kernel dependence on the reconstruction other cosmological parameters such as the $q(z)$ and the redshift of transition to the accelerated expansion. We see that reconstructed evolution of $q(z)$ also indicate that lower-order polynomial kernels are a better choice for the reconstruction compared to the stationary kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Measurement of the Matter-Radiation Equality Scale in DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The peak of the matter power spectrum, known as the turnover (TO) scale, is determined by the horizon size at the time of matter-radiation equality. This scale can serve as a standard ruler, independent of other features in the matter power spectrum, such as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Here, we present the first detection of the turnover in the galaxy auto-power spectrum, utilising the distribution of quasars (QSO) and luminous red galaxies (LRG) measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) during its first year of survey operations in a model-independent manner. To avoid confirmation bias, we first analyse the data using data blinding methods designed for the DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift space distortion and scale-dependent bias signals. We measure the angle-averaged dilation distance $D_V(z = 1.651) = (38.1\pm 2.5)r_H$ from the quasars and $D_{V}(z = 0.733) = (21.8\pm 1.0)r_H$ from the LRG sample in units of the horizon $r_H$ at the matter-radiation-equality epoch. Combining these two constraints and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model with three standard neutrino species, we can translate this into a constraint of $\Omega_{m}h^2 = 0.139^{+0.036}_{-0.046}$. We can break the $\Omega_m$-$H_0$ degeneracy with low-redshift distance measurements from type-Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon+, we obtain a sound-horizon free estimate of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter of $H_0=65.2^{+4.9}_{-6.2}$ km/s/Mpc, consistent with sound-horizon dependent DESI measurements. On the other hand, combining the DESI BAO and TO, we find a truly DESI-only measurement of $H_0=74.0^{+7.2}_{-3.5}$ km/s/Mpc, in line with DESI-only full-shape results where the sound-horizon scale is marginalised out. This discrepancy in $H_0$ can be reconciled in a $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, where the combination of DESI BAO and TO data yields $H_0 = 66.5\pm 7.2\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the local Hubble constant measurement from type Ia supernovae calibrated with Cepheids (SH0ES) by remodelling the supernova data using two supernova populations emerging from the observed bimodal distribution of the SALT2 stretch parameter. Our analysis accounts for population differences in both intrinsic properties (related to possible initial conditions, including supernova progenitor channels) and host-galaxy extinction (expected from well-known environmental differences associated observationally with the two populations). Based on a two-population Bayesian hierarchical modelling of the SALT2 light-curve parameters from the Pantheon+ compilation, we simultaneously constrain intrinsic and extrinsic properties of both supernova populations, match probabilistically the calibration supernovae with the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, and derive the Hubble constant. The difference between the two supernova populations is primarily driven by their mean absolute magnitudes and total-to-selective extinction coefficients. This is related but not equivalent to the traditional mass-step correction (including its broadening for reddened supernovae). The mean extinction coefficient of the supernova population used to propagate distances from the calibration galaxies to the Hubble flow is found to be consistent with the Milky Way-like interstellar dust model with R_B~4 and substantially higher than the extinction model assumed in the SH0ES measurement. Allowing for possible differences between reddening in the calibration galaxies and the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, we obtain H_0=70.59+/-1.15 km/s/Mpc. For the most conservative choice assuming equal prior distributions, we find H_0=71.45+/-1.03 km/s/Mpc. Our reanalysis of type Ia supernovae results in a reduction of the discrepancy with the Planck H_0 by at least 30 and up to 50 per cent (3.5-2.2sigma).</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation and turbulent reacceleration set by high-frequency observations of the radio halo in the Coma cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of the recent observation of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 6.6 GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope on models based on turbulent reacceleration of electrons produced in dark matter annihilation processes. Observing at that frequency it is possible to obtain information on the electrons spectrum at energies where the effect of turbulent reacceleration becomes sub-dominant with respect to energy losses, and therefore to obtain information on the properties of seed electrons. Under the assumption that dark matter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to the maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some constraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the neutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are generally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that can not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on the other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce the observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration phase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event responsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster. The resulting optimal mass values are in the range 100--200 GeV, with a preference for the quark annihilation channel.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances to NGC 1316, NGC 1380, NGC 1404, &amp; NGC 4457: A Pilot Study of a Parallel Distance Ladder Using Type Ia Supernovae in Early-Type Host Galaxies</title>

Abstract: Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive ($\log M_*/M_{\odot} \geq 10$) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 75.3 \pm 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory: Fast Computation and Comparison with Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast and accurate formulation for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum at one-loop order based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation, capturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor, accounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural separation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term and a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by construction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and FAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The results are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark Emulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees with emulator predictions at the 2--3\% level up to \( k \simeq 0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \) for \( z \geq 0.5 \), without any nuisance parameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the two-point correlation function remains accurate down to \( r \simeq 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc} \). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which fails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT maintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify the mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak sharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO features seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. The numerical implementation developed in this work is publicly released as the open-source Python package \texttt{ulptkit} (https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distinct behavior of decaying particles in true and false vacua of the theory can lead to enhanced generation of baryon asymmetry, a scenario we call \textit{phase separation baryogenesis}. We demonstrate that for leptogenesis this naturally allows for right handed neutrinos to generate resonantly-enhanced lepton asymmetry without fine-tuning of their masses as in typical theories. Our mechanism allows for a variety of neutrino mass hierarchies and hence possible novel connections with observations. We present a concrete realization in a minimal model with a scalar field undergoing a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Radio Signals from Radio-Band Gravitational Waves Converted from the Neutron Star Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can convert into electromagnetic waves in the presence of a magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich (GZ) effect. The characteristics of the magnetic field substantially affect this conversion probability. This paper confirms that strong magnetic fields in neutron stars significantly enhance the conversion probability, facilitating detectable radio signatures of very high-frequency (VHF, $\left(10^6-10^{11}\mathrm{~Hz}\right)$) gravitational waves. We theoretically identify two distinct signatures using single-dish telescopes (FAST, TMRT, QTT, GBT) and interferometers (SKA1/2-MID): transient signals from burst-like gravitational wave sources and persistent signals from cosmological background gravitational wave sources. These signatures are mapped to graviton spectral lines derived from quantum field theory by incorporating spin-2 and mass constraints, resulting in smooth, featureless profiles that are critical for distinguishing gravitational wave signals from astrophysical foregrounds. FAST attains a characteristic strain bound of $h_c&lt;10^{-23}$, approaching $10^{-24}$ in the frequency range of $1-3\mathrm{~GHz}$ with a 6-hour observation period. This performance exceeds the $5 \sigma$ detection thresholds for GWs originating from primordial black holes (PBHs) and nears the limits set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Additionally, projections for SKA2-MID indicate even greater sensitivity. Detecting such gravitational waves would improve our comprehension of cosmological models, refine the parameter spaces for primordial black holes, and function as a test for quantum field theory. This approach addresses significant deficiencies in VHF GW research, improving detection sensitivity and facilitating the advancement of next-generation radio telescopes such as FASTA and SKA, which feature larger fields of view and enhanced gain.</description>

      <title>Violation of Bell inequalities from Cosmic Microwave Background data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper [R. Dale. R. Lapiedra, and J. A. Morales-Lladosa, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 023506 (2023)] a cosmic-like Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality was proved for the temperature fluctuations $\delta T$ of the perturbed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), assuming local realism. This inequality can be tested from observational data. In fact, no violation for it has been found from the CMB data provided by the COBE satellite in different sky directions. This is a result which, being negative, is not conclusive in relation to the possible violation of the CHSH inequality in a cosmological context. So, the preceding analysis needs to be extended by using more precise current CMB data, like those provided by WMAP and Planck satellites. This is a task of considerable importance but, technically, much more involved in data treatments. In this work, assuming again local realism behind measurements and observational data, this extension is accomplished. The result is that a sound violation of the CHSH inequality is found, which would mean the failure of the assumed local realism in accordance with the quantum origin of the primordial temperature fluctuations in the framework of standard inflation and the orthodox interpretation of the Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Coupled Scalar Dark Sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled dark sector models have gained significant attention, motivated by recent advances in cosmology and the pressing need to address unresolved puzzles. In this work, we study coupled scalar dark sector models inspired by ultraviolet-complete frameworks such as supergravity and string theory. These models involve scalar couplings arising either from their kinetic terms, through a non-trivial field space metric, or from their scalar potential. We demonstrate how these couplings can be elegantly formulated in terms of an interacting vector, a standard tool in coupled dark sector studies, and analyse their distinct cosmological effects using a dynamical systems approach. Using this framework, we further investigate an axio-dilaton system recently explored in the literature, where the dilaton also couples to baryons. Intriguingly, we show that certain kinetic and potential interactions may mimic one another or even cancel out, making them observationally indistinguishable. If such a distinction becomes possible through observational constraints, it could provide valuable insights into the underlying field space metric and its connection to fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) I: Discovery of &gt;100 high redshift strong lenses in contiguous JWST imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the $0.54$\,deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least $50\%$ of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 9$, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond $z \sim 2$; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous $0.54$\,deg$^2$ region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey</description>

      <title>Probing Benchmark Models of Hidden-Sector Dark Matter with DAMIC-M</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles interacting with electrons using the DAMIC-M prototype detector at the Modane Underground Laboratory. The data feature a significantly lower detector single $e^-$ rate (factor 50) compared to our previous search, while also accumulating a ten times larger exposure of $\sim$1.3 kg-day. DM interactions in the skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are searched for as patterns of two or three consecutive pixels with a total charge between 2 and 4 $e^-$. We find 144 candidates of 2 $e^-$ and 1 candidate of 4 $e^-$, where 141.5 and 0.071, respectively, are expected from background. With no evidence of a DM signal, we place stringent constraints on DM particles with masses between 1 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$ interacting with electrons through an ultra-light or heavy mediator. For large ranges of DM masses below 1 GeV/c$^2$, we exclude theoretically-motivated benchmark scenarios where hidden-sector particles are produced as a major component of DM in the Universe through the freeze-in or freeze-out mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Exploiting synergies between JWST and cosmic 21-cm observations to uncover star formation in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current era of JWST, we continue to uncover a wealth of information about the Universe deep into the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we use a suite of simulations with 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical properties of early galaxies and their imprint on high-redshift observables. Our analysis incorporates a range of multi-wavelength datasets including UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST spanning $z=6-14.5$, the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS 3 and HERA respectively, as well as present-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds. We constrain a flexible halo-mass and redshift dependent model of star-formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars, and find that it is best described by minimal redshift evolution at $z\approx 6-10$, followed by rapid evolution at $z\approx10-15$. Using Bayesian inference, we derive functional posteriors of the SFE, inferring that halos of mass $M_h=10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ have efficiencies of $\approx 1 - 2\%$ at $z\lesssim10$, $\approx8\%$ at $z=12$ and $\approx21\%$ at $z=15$. We also highlight the synergy between UVLFs and global 21-cm signal from SARAS 3 in constraining the minimum virial conditions required for star-formation in halos. In parallel, we find the X-ray and radio efficiencies of early galaxies to be $f_X = 0.8^{+9.7}_{-0.4}$ and $f_r \lesssim 16.9$ respectively, improving upon previous works that exclude UVLF data. Our results underscore the critical role of UVLFs in constraining early galaxy properties, and their synergy with 21-cm and other multi-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Using Active Learning to Improve Quasar Identification for the DESI Spectra Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey uses an automatic spectral classification pipeline to classify spectra. QuasarNET is a convolutional neural network used as part of this pipeline originally trained using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In this paper we implement an active learning algorithm to optimally select spectra to use for training a new version of the QuasarNET weights file using only DESI data, specifically to improve classification accuracy. This active learning algorithm includes a novel outlier rejection step using a Self-Organizing Map to ensure we label spectra representative of the larger quasar sample observed in DESI. We perform two iterations of the active learning pipeline, assembling a final dataset of 5600 labeled spectra, a small subset of the approx 1.3 million quasar targets in DESI's Data Release 1. When splitting the spectra into training and validation subsets we meet or exceed the previously trained weights file in completeness and purity calculated on the validation dataset with less than one tenth of the amount of training data. The new weights also more consistently classify objects in the same way when used on unlabeled data compared to the old weights file. In the process of improving QuasarNET's classification accuracy we discovered a systemic error in QuasarNET's redshift estimation and used our findings to improve our understanding of QuasarNET's redshifts.</description>

We present spectral bandpass measurements of the SLIM spectrometer channels made on site using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer during SPT-SLIMs first deployment the 2024-2025 austral summer observing season. Through this we demonstrate a technique for measuring the narrow band passes of the SPT-SLIM filterbanks that improves beyond the intrinsic resolution of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer.</description>

      <title>Influence of supermassive primordial black holes on ultraviolet luminosity of high-redshift galaxies</title>

Abstract: Recently James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed an excess of luminous galaxies at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 10$). In this work, we investigate whether supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) can explain it by their influence on the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) of high-redshift galaxies. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the parameters relevant with SMPBHs against current JWST observational data. The results reveal that SMPBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{6.3\text{-}8.3} M_\odot$, abundances $f_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{-7}\text{-}10^{-5}$, and sub-Eddington ratios $\lambda_E \ll 1$ can effectively enhance the bright end of the UV LF, consistent with JWST observations.</description>
