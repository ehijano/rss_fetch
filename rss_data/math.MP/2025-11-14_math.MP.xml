      <title>Subalgebra chains and nuclear physics: Commutant approach and construction of polynomial algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review a new approach to study subalgebra chains $\mathfrak{g} \supset \mathfrak{g}'$ in the context of nuclear physics. This approach does not rely on explicit realizations as bosons or differential operators. We rely on the enveloping algebra, the notion of commutant $C_{U(\mathfrak{g})}(\mathfrak{g}^{\prime})$ and $\mathfrak{g}^{\prime}$-invariant polynomials. This approach builds on those $\mathfrak{g}^{\prime}$-invariant polynomials and finding the underlying finitely generated polynomial algebras. Those algebraic structures can then provide further information on sets of labeling operators. Another aspect of this method consists in exploiting the dual space and the symmetric algebra. Being independent of explicit realizations, it endows the algebraic relations with a universal character. We review the chains associated with $\mathfrak{su}(3) \supset \mathfrak{so}(3)$, $\mathfrak{so}(5) \supset \mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{u}(1)$, $\mathfrak{su}(4) \supset \mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)$. Those chains are known as the Elliott, Seniority and Supermultiplet. We also provide new results and insights into the subalgebra chain $\mathfrak{so}(5) \supset \mathfrak{so}(3)$ of the Surfon model. For all chains, we present the related commutant, $\mathfrak{g}^{\prime}$-invariant polynomials and Poisson algebras.</description>

      <title>The zipper condition for $4$-tensors in two-dimensional topological order and the higher relative commutants of a subfactor arising from a commuting square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: They recently study two-dimensional topological order in condensed matter physics in terms of tensor networks involving certain 3- and 4-tensors. Their 3-tensors satisfying the ``zipper condition'' play an important role there. We identify their 4-tensors with bi-unitary connections in Jones' subfactor theory in operator algebras with precise normalization constants. Then we prove that their tensors satisfying the zipper condition are the same as flat fields of strings in subfactor theory which correspond to elements in the higher relative commutants of the subfactor arising from the bi-unitary connection. This is what we expect, since the zipper condition is a kind of pentagon relations, but we clarify what conditions are exactly needed for this -- we do not need the flatness or the finite depth condition for the bi-unitary connection. We actually generalize their 4-tensors so that the four index sets of the 4-tensors can be all different and work on a ``half-version'' of the zipper condition.</description>

      <title>Total partition function with fermionic number fluxes of local toric Calabi--Yau threefold and KP integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aganagic, Dijkgraaf, Klemm, Mari\~{n}o and Vafa \cite{adkmv} predicted that the open string partition function on a smooth toric Calabi--Yau threefold should be a tau-function of multi-component KP hierarchy after considering the contributions from nonzero fermion number fluxes through loops in the toric diagram. In this paper, we prove their prediction in the case of local toric Calabi--Yau threefolds. More precisely, we construct the total partition function of local toric Calabi--Yau threefolds using an operator on the fermionic Fock space which we developed in an earlier work \cite{wyz} to represent the topological vertex, and show that the total partition function is the trace of an operator on the fermionic Fock space. As an application, we prove the KP integrability of the total partition function.</description>

      <title>Geometric foundations of thermodynamics in the quantum regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive geometrical formulation of quantum thermodynamics based on contact geometry and principal fiber bundles. The quantum thermodynamic state space is modeled as a contact manifold, with equilibrium Gibbs states forming a Legendrian submanifold that encodes the fundamental thermodynamic relations. A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes. In this framework, the thermodynamic laws in the quantum regime emerge naturally as geometric consequences.</description>

      <title>Splitting obstructions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index characterizes two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological phases of matter. We shed some light on some features of this index by investigating projection-valued maps endowed with a fermionic time-reversal symmetry.
  Our main contributions are threefold. First, we establish a decomposition theorem, proving that any such projection-valued map admits a splitting into two projection-valued maps that are related to each other via time-reversal symmetry. Second, we provide a complete homotopy classification theorem for these maps, thereby clarifying their topological structure. Third, by means of the previous analysis, we connect the Fu-Kane-Mele index to the Chern number of one of the factors in the previously-mentioned decomposition, which in turn allows to exhibit how the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological obstruction to constructing a periodic and smooth Bloch frame for the projection-valued map, measured by the Fu-Kane-Mele index, can be concentrated in a single pseudo-periodic Kramers pair.</description>

      <title>Braided finite automata and representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce classical and non-deterministic finite automata associated to representations of the braid group. After briefly reviewing basic definitions on finite automata, Coxeter's groups and the associated word problem, we turn to the Artin presentation of the braid group and its quotients. We present various representations of the braid group as deterministic or non-deterministic finite state automata and discuss connections with q-Dicke states, as well as Lusztig and crystal bases. We propose the study of the eigenvalue problem of the $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ invariant spin-chain like ``Hamiltonian'' as a systematic means for constructing canonical bases for irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n).$ This is explicitly proven for the algebra $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_2).$ Special braid representations associated with self-distributive structures are also studied as finite automata. These finite state automata organize clusters of eigenstates of these braid representations.</description>

      <title>RLD Fisher Information Bound for Multiparameter Estimation of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11178v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks in quantum metrology is to estimate multiple parameters embedded in a noisy process, i.e., a quantum channel. In this paper, we study fundamental limits to quantum channel estimation via the concept of amortization and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information value. Our key technical result is the proof of a chain-rule inequality for the RLD Fisher information value, which implies that amortization, i.e., access to a catalyst state family, does not increase the RLD Fisher information value of quantum channels. This technical result leads to a fundamental and efficiently computable limitation for multiparameter channel estimation in the sequential setting, in terms of the RLD Fisher information value. As a consequence, we conclude that if the RLD Fisher information value is finite, then Heisenberg scaling is unattainable in the multiparameter setting.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interpolation of Entanglement Purification Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement purification is the conversion of copies of weakly entangled pairs shared between two separated parties into a smaller number of strongly entangled shared pairs using only local operations and classical communication. Choosing between different entanglement purification protocols generally involves weighing up a trade-off between the ratio of strongly entangled pairs produced to weakly entangled pairs consumed, which we call the rate of the protocol, and the degree of the entanglement of the strongly entangled pairs, typically measured by the fidelity of those pairs to maximally entangled states. By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the adhesion model and the reconstruction problem in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, a basic explanation of the observed concentration of mass in singular structures is provided by the Zeldovich approximation, which takes the form of free-streaming flow for perturbations of a uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe in co-moving coordinates. The adhesion model suppresses multi-streaming by introducing viscosity. We study mass flow in this model by analysis of Lagrangian advection in the zero-viscosity limit. Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Amp\`ere measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Amp\`ere measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier &amp; Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast. Soc. 346, 2003). In a neighborhood of merging singular structures in our examples, however, we show that reconstruction yielding a monotone Lagrangian map cannot be exact a.e., even off of the singularities themselves.</description>

      <title>Improved coherence time of a non-Hermitian qubit in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing's potential for exponential speedup is fundamentally limited by decoherence, a phenomenon arising from environmental interactions. Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly $PT$-symmetric systems, offers a novel framework for extending coherence times. This study examines a qubit's coherence under non-Hermitian $PT$-symmetric dynamics, highlighting significantly enhanced coherence times compared to Hermitian setups. The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations. These findings point to promising strategies for managing decoherence, which could significantly advance approaches to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>The $N$-achromat and beyond: a unified variational framework for optimal chromatic aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present novel and effective methods for reducing chromatic aberrations in
  cemented lens systems. We derive an analytical solution coined the pentachromat, which
  corrects five distinct colors. This method can naturally be extended to accommodate
  an arbitrary number of lenses and to correct for a customized selection of spectral lines.
  Since correcting for specific rays rather than the entire residual spectrum
  can overconstrain the system, we introduce a variational formulation. This approach
  tames the residual spectrum by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional
  designs like the superachromat, while giving theoretical guarantees to reach the
  optimal solutions.
  Furthermore, this innovative methodology opens up previously uncharted design
  possibilities, such as multiple-focal-length achromatic systems. This allows for the
  selection of specific optical powers paired with desired bandwidths, enabling the
  design of highly specialized and tailored optical systems.
  Finally, we couple our variational framework with a combinatorial search, allowing to
  find the type of glasses and their geometry such that it reaches the best residual spectrum
  over an available catalogue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fields on AdS$_n$ in both global and Poincar\'e charts and, for each mass window, we classify the boundary conditions at conformal infinity that ensure the existence of advanced and retarded propagators. We distinguish the well-known MIT--bag class from a generalized family, thereby extending to arbitrary dimensions the procedure initiated by Blanco. As in the scalar case, we show that suitable generalized boundary data can support bound states. In four dimensions we work out two explicit examples: (i) the MIT case, for which we construct the advanced/retarded propagators and the two-point function of the associated ground state and (ii) a representative generalized boundary condition, for which we construct the propagators and exhibit a normalizable bound state.</description>

      <title>Relations among the universal Racah algebra, the anticommutator spin algebra and a skew group ring over $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the algebra homomorphism from the universal Racah algebra $\Re$ into $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, originally introduced in connection with representation-theoretic and combinatorial models. Using a Lie algebra isomorphism $\mathfrak{so}_3\to \mathfrak{sl}_2$, we reformulate this homomorphism in a more symmetric form. The anticommutator spin algebra $\mathcal{A}$, which serves as a fermionic counterpart to the standard angular momentum algebra, can be regarded as an anticommutator analogue of $U(\mathfrak{so}_{3})$. In analogy with this isomorphism, we embed $\mathcal A$ into a skew group ring of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ over $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, denoted by $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)_{\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}}$. We further construct a realization of $\Re$ within $\mathcal A$, corresponding to the homomorphism $\Re\to U(\mathfrak{so}_3)$. Composed with the embedding $\mathcal A \hookrightarrow U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)_{\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}}$, this realization recovers the original homomorphism $\Re \to U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and thereby clarifies the relationships among these algebras.</description>

Abstract: We show that Laplace isospectral deformations within a conformal class of generic Liouville metrics on the two-dimensional torus that are linear in the deformation parameter are necessarily trivial. Two of the main ingredients in our proof are a noncancellation result for the wave trace and an analysis of the second order variational formula for the energy functional associated to closed geodesics. Noncancellation allows us to detect parts of the length spectrum from the Laplace spectrum and conclude rational integrability for the deformed geodesic flow (Liouville metrics are folklorically conjectured to be the only Riemannian metrics with integrable geodesic flow on the torus). We then use the second variational formula to show how the preservation of a single rational torus is sufficient to conclude triviality of the deformation, assuming linearity. We also present some evidence that our hypothesis of linearity may indeed be necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove delocalization for the Anderson model on an infinite regular tree (or Cayley graph or Bethe lattice) at low disorder. This extends earlier results of Klein and Aizenman--Warzel by filling in the previously missing parts of the spectrum. Our argument generalizes to any disorder with small fourth moment and sufficiently regular density. We prove continuity of the Lyapunov exponent as the disorder vanishes.</description>

      <title>Eigenfunctions of deformed Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral problems associated with the finite-difference operators $H_N = 2 \cosh(p) + V_N(x)$, where $V_N(x)$ is an arbitrary polynomial potential of degree $N$. These systems can be regarded as a solvable deformation of the standard Schr\"odinger operators $p^2 + V_N(x)$, and they arise naturally from the quantization of the Seiberg-Witten curve of four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N} = 2$, SU($N$) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Using the open topological string/spectral theory correspondence, we construct exact, analytic eigenfunctions of $H_N$, valid for arbitrary polynomial potentials and describing both bound and resonant states. Our solutions are entire in $x$ for generic values of the energy, and become $L^2$-normalizable only at a discrete set of energies. An interesting feature of these Hamiltonians is the existence of special loci in the parameter space of the potential, the so-called Toda points. The eigenfunctions exhibit enhanced decay at these points, leading to spectral degeneracies for confining potentials and to a real energy spectrum for unbounded ones. Our results provide a rare example of a quantum-mechanical spectral problem that is exactly solvable, admitting explicit, analytic eigenfunctions for both bound and resonant states.</description>

      <title>Localized stem structures in soliton reconnection of the asymmetric Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconnection processes of 3-solitons with 2-resonance can produce distinct local structures that initially connect two pairs of V-shaped branches, then disappear, and later re-emerge as new forms. We call such local structures as stem structures. In this paper, we investigate the variable-length stem structures during the soliton reconnection of the asymmetric Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov system. We consider two scenarios: weak 2-resonances (i.e., $a_{12}=a_{13}=0,\,0&lt;a_{23}&lt;+\infty$) and strong 2-resonances (i.e., $a_{12}=a_{13}=+\infty,\,0&lt;a_{23}&lt;+\infty$). We determine the asymptotic forms of the four arms and their corresponding stem structures using two-variable asymptotic analysis method which is involved simultaneously with one space variable $y$ (or $x$) and one temporal variable $t$. Different from known studies, our findings reveal that the asymptotic forms of the arms $S_2$ and $S_3$ differ by a phase shift as $t\to\pm\infty$. Building on these asymptotic forms, we perform a detailed analysis of the trajectories, amplitudes, and velocities of the soliton arms and stem structures. Subsequently, we discuss the localization of the stem structures, focusing on their endpoints, lengths, and extreme points in both weak and strong 2-resonance scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the ground state energy of the three-dimensional magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the shape optimization problem of minimizing the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field among three-dimensional domains of fixed volume. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, a generalized ``magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does not hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic field is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains reveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers must elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the magnetic field as the field strength increases. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present numerical minimizers which confirm this prediction and give rise to further conjectures.</description>

Abstract: We show how any given system of ordinary differential equations in $n$-dimensional configuration space can be obtained from a peculiar variational problem with one local symmetry. The obtained action functional leads to the Hamiltonian formulation in $(4n+2)$-dimensional phase space. As concrete examples, we discuss the cases of Lagrange-d'Alembert equations with nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, as well as the equations of motion with dissipative (frictional) forces.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</description>

Abstract: This note extends the construction of $D_{k}$ ALF gravitational instantons in Schroers--Singer to a new case where the nonlinear superposition is given by the $D_{1}$ Atiyah--Hitchin metric and $k-1$ copies of $A_{0}$ Taub-NUT metrics. We then give a general class of ALF spaces such that each of them contains a non-holomorphic minimal sphere. Together with Foscolo's construction this gives a large class of $K3$ surfaces containing non-holomorphic minimal spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although wave kinetic equations have been rigorously derived in dimension $d \geq 2$, both the physical and mathematical theory of wave turbulence in dimension $d = 1$ is less understood. Here, we look at the one-dimensional MMT (Majda, McLaughlin, and Tabak) model on a large interval of length $L$ with nonlinearity of size $\alpha$, restricting to the case where there are no derivatives in the nonlinearity. The dispersion relation here is $|k|^\sigma$ for $0 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$ and $\sigma \neq 1$, and when $\sigma = 2$, the MMT model specializes to the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. In the range of $1 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$, the proposed collision kernel in the kinetic equation is trivial, begging the question of what is the appropriate kinetic theory in that setting. In this paper we study the kinetic limit $L \to \infty$ and $\alpha \to 0$ under various scaling laws $\alpha \sim L^{-\gamma}$ and exhibit the wave kinetic equation up to timescales $T \sim L^{-\epsilon}\alpha^{-\frac{5}{4}}$ (or $T \sim L^{-\epsilon} T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{\frac{5}{8}}$). In the case of a trivial collision kernel, our result implies there can be no nontrivial dynamics of the second moment up to timescales $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$.</description>

Abstract: Research on quantum states often focuses on the correlation between nonlocal effects and local unitary invariants, among which local unitary equivalence plays a significant role in quantum state classification and resource theories. This paper focuses on the local unitary equivalence of multipartite quantum states in quantum information theory, aiming to determine a complete set of invariants that identify their local unitary orbits; these invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing the physical properties preserved under local unitary transformations.The study deeply explores the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the method of detecting entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants. Taking two-qubit systems as an example, it verifies the measurability of invariants that determine equivalence and establishes a connection between Makhlin fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants, related to the traces of products of density operators and marginal states, can be measured through cycle tests (an extended form of SWAP tests).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05249v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 3]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,3]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.</description>

Abstract: For every family of orthogonal polynomials, we define a new realization of the Yangian of ${\mathfrak{gl}}_n$. Except in the case of Dickson polynomials, the new realizations do not satisfy the RTT relation. We obtain an analogue of the Christoffel-Darboux formula. Similar construction can be made for any family of functions satisfying certain recurrence relations, for example, $q$-Pochhhammer symbols and Bessel functions. Furthermore, using an analogue of the Jordan-Schwinger map, we define the ternary Yangian for a Lie algebra as a flat deformation of the current algebra of certain ternary extension of the given Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we provide a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subspace of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators (and their deformations induced by flavour symmetries) are defined without localizations. The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators.
  As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry.
  We further apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing formula for Coulomb branches and to derive new generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</description>

      <title>One application of Duistermaat-Heckman measure in quantum information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the exact separability probability of 8/33 for two-qubit states under the Hilbert-Schmidt measure has been reported by Huong and Khoi [\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad8493}{J.Phys.A:Math.Theor.{\bf57}, 445304(2024)}], detailed derivations remain inaccessible for general audiences. This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result, elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds, and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation theory, and quantum probability.</description>

      <title>Polyadic encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel original procedure of encryption/decryption based on the polyadic algebraic structures and on signal processing methods is proposed. First, we use signals with integer amplitudes to send information. Then we use polyadic techniques to transfer the plaintext into series of special integers. The receiver restores the plaintext using special rules and systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of spectral duality in classical integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of the ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of a noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin-type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is the large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of the Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear diffusion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear Lorentz invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced, which is consistent with the conservation laws of particles number, energy and momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit, but it is not given by the J\"uttner distribution commonly employed in relativistic kinetic theory. The nonlinear kinetic diffusion equation on a general Lorentzian manifold is consistent with the contracted Bianchi identities and therefore can be coupled to the Einstein equations of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-induced vanishing of brane partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of 't Hooft anomalies, backgrounds for the symmetries of a quantum field theory can lead to non-conservation of Noether currents, or more generally, to the presence of charged insertions in the path integral. When there is a net background charge, the partition function evaluated on closed manifolds will vanish. For anomalous symmetries, this statement can also be understood as the anomaly theory giving rise to a non-trivial anomalous phase for the partition function even for "rigid" transformations which leave all background fields unchanged. We use the generalisation of this second viewpoint to the setting of anomalous higher-form symmetries in order to show vanishing of the partition function for a number of examples, both with and without a Lagrangian description. In particular, we show how to derive from these considerations the analogue of the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition for the M5-brane, and also that for the D3-brane in S-fold backgrounds.</description>
