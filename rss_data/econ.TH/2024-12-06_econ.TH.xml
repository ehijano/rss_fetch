      <title>Persuading an inattentive and privately informed receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the persuasion of a receiver who accesses information only if she exerts costly attention effort. A sender designs an experiment to persuade the receiver to take a specific action. The experiment affects the receiver's attention effort, that is, the probability that she updates her beliefs. As a result, persuasion has two margins: extensive (effort) and intensive (action). The receiver's utility exhibits a supermodularity property in information and effort. By leveraging this property, we prove a general equivalence between experiments and persuasion mechanisms \`a la Kolotilin et al.\ (2017). In applications, the sender's optimal strategy involves censoring favorable states.</description>

      <title>Strategic Analysis of Fair Rank-Minimizing Mechanisms with Agent Refusal Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01673v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines strategic issues in fair rank-minimizing mechanisms, which choose an assignment that minimizes the average rank of object types to which agents are assigned and satisfy a fairness property called equal treatment of equals. As one of these fair mechanisms, the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is considered. We focus on the case where agents can refuse their assignment and obtain the outside option instead. Without the refusal option, truth-telling is not strategically dominated by any strategies if a fair rank-minimizing mechanism is used. However, if agents have the option and the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is used, then a strategy called an outside option demotion strategy strategically dominates truth-telling. Moreover, we show that adopting this strategy may lead to inefficient assignments. To counter this, we propose a modification of the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism, though it may lead agents to strategically reduce the number of acceptable types.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Steady Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of the grand coalition of a cooperative game by investigating its possible internal dynamics. Each coalition is capable of forcing all players to reconsider the current state of the game when it does not provide sufficient payoff. Different coalitions may ask for contradictory evolutions, leading to the impossibility of the grand coalition forming. In this paper, we give a characterization of the impossibility, for a given state, of finding a new state dominating the previous one such that each aggrieved coalition has a satisfactory payoff. To do so, we develop new polyhedral tools related to a new family of polyhedra, appearing in numerous situations in cooperative game theory.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the classic facility location problem and consider a variation, in which each agent's individual cost function is equal to their distance from the facility multiplied by a scaling factor which is determined by the facility placement. In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find a characterization of continuous, strategyproof, and anonymous mechanisms, and compute the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by these mechanisms.</description>
