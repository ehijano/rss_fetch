      <title>Building An Efficient Grid On GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid space partitioning is a technique to speed up queries to graphics databases. We present a parallel grid construction algorithm which can efficiently construct a structured grid on GPU hardware. Our approach is substantially faster than existing uniform grid construction algorithms, especially on non-homogeneous scenes. Indeed, it can populate a grid in real-time (at rates over 25 Hz), for architectural scenes with 10 million triangles.</description>

      <title>The Simplex Projection: Lossless Visualization of 4D Compositional Data on a 2D Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplex projection expands the capabilities of simplex plots (also known as ternary plots) to achieve a lossless visualization of 4D compositional data on a 2D canvas. Previously, this was only possible for 3D compositional data. We demonstrate how our approach can be applied to individual data points, point clouds, and continuous probability density functions on simplices. While we showcase our visualization technique specifically for 4D compositional data, we offer rigorous proofs that support its extension to compositional data of any (finite) dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Bridging 3D Gaussian and Mesh for Freeview Video Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is only a preview version of GauMesh. Recently, primitive-based rendering has been proven to achieve convincing results in solving the problem of modeling and rendering the 3D dynamic scene from 2D images. Despite this, in the context of novel view synthesis, each type of primitive has its inherent defects in terms of representation ability. It is difficult to exploit the mesh to depict the fuzzy geometry. Meanwhile, the point-based splatting (e.g. the 3D Gaussian Splatting) method usually produces artifacts or blurry pixels in the area with smooth geometry and sharp textures. As a result, it is difficult, even not impossible, to represent the complex and dynamic scene with a single type of primitive. To this end, we propose a novel approach, GauMesh, to bridge the 3D Gaussian and Mesh for modeling and rendering the dynamic scenes. Given a sequence of tracked mesh as initialization, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the mesh geometry, color texture, opacity maps, a set of 3D Gaussians, and the deformation field. At a specific time, we perform $\alpha$-blending on the RGB and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffers from mesh and 3D Gaussian rasterizations. This produces the final rendering, which is supervised by the ground-truth image. Experiments demonstrate that our approach adapts the appropriate type of primitives to represent the different parts of the dynamic scene and outperforms all the baseline methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons without losing render speed.</description>

      <title>QEAN: Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network for Visual Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of music-generated dance is a novel and challenging Image generation task. It aims to input a piece of music and seed motions, then generate natural dance movements for the subsequent music. Transformer-based methods face challenges in time series prediction tasks related to human movements and music due to their struggle in capturing the nonlinear relationship and temporal aspects. This can lead to issues like joint deformation, role deviation, floating, and inconsistencies in dance movements generated in response to the music. In this paper, we propose a Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network (QEAN) for visual dance synthesis from a quaternion perspective, which consists of a Spin Position Embedding (SPE) module and a Quaternion Rotary Attention (QRA) module. First, SPE embeds position information into self-attention in a rotational manner, leading to better learning of features of movement sequences and audio sequences, and improved understanding of the connection between music and dance. Second, QRA represents and fuses 3D motion features and audio features in the form of a series of quaternions, enabling the model to better learn the temporal coordination of music and dance under the complex temporal cycle conditions of dance generation. Finally, we conducted experiments on the dataset AIST++, and the results show that our approach achieves better and more robust performance in generating accurate, high-quality dance movements. Our source code and dataset can be available from https://github.com/MarasyZZ/QEAN and https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset respectively.</description>

      <title>View-Consistent 3D Editing with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D editing, offering efficient, high-fidelity rendering and enabling precise local manipulations. Currently, diffusion-based 2D editing models are harnessed to modify multi-view rendered images, which then guide the editing of 3DGS models. However, this approach faces a critical issue of multi-view inconsistency, where the guidance images exhibit significant discrepancies across views, leading to mode collapse and visual artifacts of 3DGS. To this end, we introduce View-consistent Editing (VcEdit), a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates 3DGS into image editing processes, ensuring multi-view consistency in edited guidance images and effectively mitigating mode collapse issues. VcEdit employs two innovative consistency modules: the Cross-attention Consistency Module and the Editing Consistency Module, both designed to reduce inconsistencies in edited images. By incorporating these consistency modules into an iterative pattern, VcEdit proficiently resolves the issue of multi-view inconsistency, facilitating high-quality 3DGS editing across a diverse range of scenes.</description>

      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>LightIt: Illumination Modeling and Control for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LightIt, a method for explicit illumination control for image generation. Recent generative methods lack lighting control, which is crucial to numerous artistic aspects of image generation such as setting the overall mood or cinematic appearance. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition the generation on shading and normal maps. We model the lighting with single bounce shading, which includes cast shadows. We first train a shading estimation module to generate a dataset of real-world images and shading pairs. Then, we train a control network using the estimated shading and normals as input. Our method demonstrates high-quality image generation and lighting control in numerous scenes. Additionally, we use our generated dataset to train an identity-preserving relighting model, conditioned on an image and a target shading. Our method is the first that enables the generation of images with controllable, consistent lighting and performs on par with specialized relighting state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Speech-driven Personalized Gesture Synthetics: Harnessing Automatic Fuzzy Feature Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-driven gesture generation is an emerging field within virtual human creation. However, a significant challenge lies in accurately determining and processing the multitude of input features (such as acoustic, semantic, emotional, personality, and even subtle unknown features). Traditional approaches, reliant on various explicit feature inputs and complex multimodal processing, constrain the expressiveness of resulting gestures and limit their applicability. To address these challenges, we present Persona-Gestor, a novel end-to-end generative model designed to generate highly personalized 3D full-body gestures solely relying on raw speech audio. The model combines a fuzzy feature extractor and a non-autoregressive Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) transformer diffusion architecture. The fuzzy feature extractor harnesses a fuzzy inference strategy that automatically infers implicit, continuous fuzzy features. These fuzzy features, represented as a unified latent feature, are fed into the AdaLN transformer. The AdaLN transformer introduces a conditional mechanism that applies a uniform function across all tokens, thereby effectively modeling the correlation between the fuzzy features and the gesture sequence. This module ensures a high level of gesture-speech synchronization while preserving naturalness. Finally, we employ the diffusion model to train and infer various gestures. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations on the Trinity, ZEGGS, and BEAT datasets confirm our model's superior performance to the current state-of-the-art approaches. Persona-Gestor improves the system's usability and generalization capabilities, setting a new benchmark in speech-driven gesture synthesis and broadening the horizon for virtual human technology.

      <title>N2F2: Hierarchical Scene Understanding with Nested Neural Feature Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding complex scenes at multiple levels of abstraction remains a formidable challenge in computer vision. To address this, we introduce Nested Neural Feature Fields (N2F2), a novel approach that employs hierarchical supervision to learn a single feature field, wherein different dimensions within the same high-dimensional feature encode scene properties at varying granularities. Our method allows for a flexible definition of hierarchies, tailored to either the physical dimensions or semantics or both, thereby enabling a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of scenes. We leverage a 2D class-agnostic segmentation model to provide semantically meaningful pixel groupings at arbitrary scales in the image space, and query the CLIP vision-encoder to obtain language-aligned embeddings for each of these segments. Our proposed hierarchical supervision method then assigns different nested dimensions of the feature field to distill the CLIP embeddings using deferred volumetric rendering at varying physical scales, creating a coarse-to-fine representation. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art feature field distillation methods on tasks such as open-vocabulary 3D segmentation and localization, demonstrating the effectiveness of the learned nested feature field.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has greatly accelerated the rendering speed of novel view synthesis. Unlike neural implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that represent a 3D scene with position and viewpoint-conditioned neural networks, 3D Gaussian Splatting utilizes a set of Gaussian ellipsoids to model the scene so that efficient rendering can be accomplished by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids into images. Apart from the fast rendering speed, the explicit representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting facilitates editing tasks like dynamic reconstruction, geometry editing, and physical simulation. Considering the rapid change and growing number of works in this field, we present a literature review of recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, which can be roughly classified into 3D reconstruction, 3D editing, and other downstream applications by functionality. Traditional point-based rendering methods and the rendering formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting are also illustrated for a better understanding of this technique. This survey aims to help beginners get into this field quickly and provide experienced researchers with a comprehensive overview, which can stimulate the future development of the 3D Gaussian Splatting representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents the development and results of an advanced SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) simulation framework, designed for high fidelity fluid dynamics modeling. Our framework, accessible at https://github.com/jason-huang03/SPH_Project, integrates various SPH algorithms including WCSPH, PCISPH, and DFSPH, alongside techniques for rigid-fluid coupling and high viscosity fluid simulations. Leveraging the computational power of CUDA and the versatility of Taichi, the framework excels in handling large-scale simulations with millions of particles. We demonstrate the capability of our framework through a series of simulations showcasing rigid-fluid coupling, high viscosity fluids, and large-scale fluid dynamics. Furthermore, a detailed performance analysis reveals CUDA's superior efficiency across different hardware platforms. This work is an exploraion into modern SPH simulation techniques, showcasing their practical implementation and capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stylized Face Sketch Extraction via Generative Prior with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial sketches are both a concise way of showing the identity of a person and a means to express artistic intention. While a few techniques have recently emerged that allow sketches to be extracted in different styles, they typically rely on a large amount of data that is difficult to obtain. Here, we propose StyleSketch, a method for extracting high-resolution stylized sketches from a face image. Using the rich semantics of the deep features from a pretrained StyleGAN, we are able to train a sketch generator with 16 pairs of face and the corresponding sketch images. The sketch generator utilizes part-based losses with two-stage learning for fast convergence during training for high-quality sketch extraction. Through a set of comparisons, we show that StyleSketch outperforms existing state-of-the-art sketch extraction methods and few-shot image adaptation methods for the task of extracting high-resolution abstract face sketches. We further demonstrate the versatility of StyleSketch by extending its use to other domains and explore the possibility of semantic editing. The project page can be found in https://kwanyun.github.io/stylesketch_project.</description>

      <title>3DGS-ReLoc: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Map Representation and Visual ReLocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel system designed for 3D mapping and visual relocalization using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our proposed method uses LiDAR and camera data to create accurate and visually plausible representations of the environment. By leveraging LiDAR data to initiate the training of the 3D Gaussian Splatting map, our system constructs maps that are both detailed and geometrically accurate. To mitigate excessive GPU memory usage and facilitate rapid spatial queries, we employ a combination of a 2D voxel map and a KD-tree. This preparation makes our method well-suited for visual localization tasks, enabling efficient identification of correspondences between the query image and the rendered image from the Gaussian Splatting map via normalized cross-correlation (NCC). Additionally, we refine the camera pose of the query image using feature-based matching and the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. The effectiveness, adaptability, and precision of our system are demonstrated through extensive evaluation on the KITTI360 dataset.</description>

      <title>Generative Motion Stylization within Canonical Motion Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stylized motion breathes life into characters. However, the fixed skeleton structure and style representation hinder existing data-driven motion synthesis methods from generating stylized motion for various characters. In this work, we propose a generative motion stylization pipeline, named MotionS, for synthesizing diverse and stylized motion on cross-structure characters using cross-modality style prompts. Our key insight is to embed motion style into a cross-modality latent space and perceive the cross-structure skeleton topologies, allowing for motion stylization within a canonical motion space. Specifically, the large-scale Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training (CLIP) model is leveraged to construct the cross-modality latent space, enabling flexible style representation within this space. Additionally, two topology-encoded tokens are learned to capture the canonical and specific skeleton topologies, facilitating cross-structure topology shifting. Subsequently, the topology-shifted stylization diffusion is designed to generate motion content for the specific skeleton and stylize it in the shifted canonical motion space using multi-modality style descriptions. Through an extensive set of examples, we demonstrate the flexibility and generalizability of our pipeline across various characters and style descriptions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments underscore the superiority of our pipeline over state-of-the-art methods, consistently delivering high-quality stylized motion across a broad spectrum of skeletal structures.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Text to Image Synthesis: Survey and Taxonomy of Image Quality Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis have been enabled by exploiting a combination of language and vision through foundation models. These models are pre-trained on tremendous amounts of text-image pairs sourced from the World Wide Web or other large-scale databases. As the demand for high-quality image generation shifts towards ensuring content alignment between text and image, novel evaluation metrics have been developed with the aim of mimicking human judgments. Thus, researchers have started to collect datasets with increasingly complex annotations to study the compositionality of vision-language models and their incorporation as a quality measure of compositional alignment between text and image contents. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing text-to-image evaluation metrics and propose a new taxonomy for categorizing these metrics. We also review frequently adopted text-image benchmark datasets before discussing techniques to optimize text-to-image synthesis models towards quality and human preferences. Ultimately, we derive guidelines for improving text-to-image evaluation and discuss the open challenges and current limitations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-modal Neural Scene Representations With Applications on Thermal Imaging</title>

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) quickly evolved as the new de-facto standard for the task of novel view synthesis when trained on a set of RGB images. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of neural scene representations, such as NeRFs, in the context of multi-modal learning. Specifically, we present four different strategies of how to incorporate a second modality, other than RGB, into NeRFs: (1) training from scratch independently on both modalities; (2) pre-training on RGB and fine-tuning on the second modality; (3) adding a second branch; and (4) adding a separate component to predict (color) values of the additional modality. We chose thermal imaging as second modality since it strongly differs from RGB in terms of radiosity, making it challenging to integrate into neural scene representations. For the evaluation of the proposed strategies, we captured a new publicly available multi-view dataset, ThermalMix, consisting of six common objects and about 360 RGB and thermal images in total. We employ cross-modality calibration prior to data capturing, leading to high-quality alignments between RGB and thermal images. Our findings reveal that adding a second branch to NeRF performs best for novel view synthesis on thermal images while also yielding compelling results on RGB. Finally, we also show that our analysis generalizes to other modalities, including near-infrared images and depth maps. Project page: https://mert-o.github.io/ThermalNeRF/.</description>

      <title>VideoMV: Consistent Multi-View Generation Based on Large Video Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating multi-view images based on text or single-image prompts is a critical capability for the creation of 3D content. Two fundamental questions on this topic are what data we use for training and how to ensure multi-view consistency. This paper introduces a novel framework that makes fundamental contributions to both questions. Unlike leveraging images from 2D diffusion models for training, we propose a dense consistent multi-view generation model that is fine-tuned from off-the-shelf video generative models. Images from video generative models are more suitable for multi-view generation because the underlying network architecture that generates them employs a temporal module to enforce frame consistency. Moreover, the video data sets used to train these models are abundant and diverse, leading to a reduced train-finetuning domain gap. To enhance multi-view consistency, we introduce a 3D-Aware Denoising Sampling, which first employs a feed-forward reconstruction module to get an explicit global 3D model, and then adopts a sampling strategy that effectively involves images rendered from the global 3D model into the denoising sampling loop to improve the multi-view consistency of the final images. As a by-product, this module also provides a fast way to create 3D assets represented by 3D Gaussians within a few seconds. Our approach can generate 24 dense views and converges much faster in training than state-of-the-art approaches (4 GPU hours versus many thousand GPU hours) with comparable visual quality and consistency. By further fine-tuning, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual effects. Our project page is aigc3d.github.io/VideoMV.</description>

      <title>Generic 3D Diffusion Adapter Using Controlled Multi-View Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-domain 3D object synthesis has been lagging behind image synthesis due to limited data and higher computational complexity. To bridge this gap, recent works have investigated multi-view diffusion but often fall short in either 3D consistency, visual quality, or efficiency. This paper proposes MVEdit, which functions as a 3D counterpart of SDEdit, employing ancestral sampling to jointly denoise multi-view images and output high-quality textured meshes. Built on off-the-shelf 2D diffusion models, MVEdit achieves 3D consistency through a training-free 3D Adapter, which lifts the 2D views of the last timestep into a coherent 3D representation, then conditions the 2D views of the next timestep using rendered views, without uncompromising visual quality. With an inference time of only 2-5 minutes, this framework achieves better trade-off between quality and speed than score distillation. MVEdit is highly versatile and extendable, with a wide range of applications including text/image-to-3D generation, 3D-to-3D editing, and high-quality texture synthesis. In particular, evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both image-to-3D and text-guided texture generation tasks. Additionally, we introduce a method for fine-tuning 2D latent diffusion models on small 3D datasets with limited resources, enabling fast low-resolution text-to-3D initialization.</description>

      <title>VFusion3D: Learning Scalable 3D Generative Models from Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel paradigm for building scalable 3D generative models utilizing pre-trained video diffusion models. The primary obstacle in developing foundation 3D generative models is the limited availability of 3D data. Unlike images, texts, or videos, 3D data are not readily accessible and are difficult to acquire. This results in a significant disparity in scale compared to the vast quantities of other types of data. To address this issue, we propose using a video diffusion model, trained with extensive volumes of text, images, and videos, as a knowledge source for 3D data. By unlocking its multi-view generative capabilities through fine-tuning, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset to train a feed-forward 3D generative model. The proposed model, VFusion3D, trained on nearly 3M synthetic multi-view data, can generate a 3D asset from a single image in seconds and achieves superior performance when compared to current SOTA feed-forward 3D generative models, with users preferring our results over 70% of the time.</description>

      <title>One-Step Image Translation with Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address two limitations of existing conditional diffusion models: their slow inference speed due to the iterative denoising process and their reliance on paired data for model fine-tuning. To tackle these issues, we introduce a general method for adapting a single-step diffusion model to new tasks and domains through adversarial learning objectives. Specifically, we consolidate various modules of the vanilla latent diffusion model into a single end-to-end generator network with small trainable weights, enhancing its ability to preserve the input image structure while reducing overfitting. We demonstrate that, for unpaired settings, our model CycleGAN-Turbo outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods for various scene translation tasks, such as day-to-night conversion and adding/removing weather effects like fog, snow, and rain. We extend our method to paired settings, where our model pix2pix-Turbo is on par with recent works like Control-Net for Sketch2Photo and Edge2Image, but with a single-step inference. This work suggests that single-step diffusion models can serve as strong backbones for a range of GAN learning objectives.

      <title>RDA-INR: Riemannian Diffeomorphic Autoencoding via Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphic registration frameworks such as Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) are used in computer graphics and the medical domain for atlas building, statistical latent modeling, and pairwise and groupwise registration. In recent years, researchers have developed neural network-based approaches regarding diffeomorphic registration to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of traditional methods. In this work, we focus on a limitation of neural network-based atlas building and statistical latent modeling methods, namely that they either are (i) resolution dependent or (ii) disregard any data/problem-specific geometry needed for proper mean-variance analysis. In particular, we overcome this limitation by designing a novel encoder based on resolution-independent implicit neural representations. The encoder achieves resolution invariance for LDDMM-based statistical latent modeling. Additionally, the encoder adds LDDMM Riemannian geometry to resolution-independent deep learning models for statistical latent modeling. We showcase that the Riemannian geometry aspect improves latent modeling and is required for a proper mean-variance analysis. Furthermore, to showcase the benefit of resolution independence for LDDMM-based data variability modeling, we show that our approach outperforms another neural network-based LDDMM latent code model. Our work paves a way to more research into how Riemannian geometry, shape/image analysis, and deep learning can be combined.</description>

      <title>PU-Ray: Domain-Independent Point Cloud Upsampling via Ray Marching on Neural Implicit Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in deep-learning point cloud upsampling methods have improved the input to intelligent transportation systems, they still suffer from issues of domain dependency between synthetic and real-scanned point clouds. This paper addresses the above issues by proposing a new ray-based upsampling approach with an arbitrary rate, where a depth prediction is made for each query ray and its corresponding patch. Our novel method simulates the sphere-tracing ray marching algorithm on the neural implicit surface defined with an unsigned distance function (UDF) to achieve more precise and stable ray-depth predictions by training a point-transformer-based network. The rule-based mid-point query sampling method generates more evenly distributed points without requiring an end-to-end model trained using a nearest-neighbor-based reconstruction loss function, which may be biased towards the training dataset. Self-supervised learning becomes possible with accurate ground truths within the input point cloud. The results demonstrate the method's versatility across domains and training scenarios with limited computational resources and training data. Comprehensive analyses of synthetic and real-scanned applications provide empirical evidence for the significance of the upsampling task across the computer vision and graphics domains to real-world applications of ITS.</description>

      <title>SoftMAC: Differentiable Soft Body Simulation with Forecast-based Contact Model and Two-way Coupling with Articulated Rigid Bodies and Clothes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable physics simulation provides an avenue to tackle previously intractable challenges through gradient-based optimization, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of solving robotics-related problems. To apply differentiable simulation in diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, a key challenge is to integrate various materials in a unified framework. We present SoftMAC, a differentiable simulation framework that couples soft bodies with articulated rigid bodies and clothes. SoftMAC simulates soft bodies with the continuum-mechanics-based Material Point Method (MPM). We provide a novel forecast-based contact model for MPM, which effectively reduces penetration without introducing other artifacts like unnatural rebound. To couple MPM particles with deformable and non-volumetric clothes meshes, we also propose a penetration tracing algorithm that reconstructs the signed distance field in local area. Diverging from previous works, SoftMAC simulates the complete dynamics of each modality and incorporates them into a cohesive system with an explicit and differentiable coupling mechanism. The feature empowers SoftMAC to handle a broader spectrum of interactions, such as soft bodies serving as manipulators and engaging with underactuated systems. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed differentiable pipeline in downstream robotic manipulation applications. Supplementary materials and videos are available on our project website at https://sites.google.com/view/softmac.</description>

      <title>FaceTalk: Audio-Driven Motion Diffusion for Neural Parametric Head Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FaceTalk, a novel generative approach designed for synthesizing high-fidelity 3D motion sequences of talking human heads from input audio signal. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including hair, ears, and finer-scale eye movements, we propose to couple speech signal with the latent space of neural parametric head models to create high-fidelity, temporally coherent motion sequences. We propose a new latent diffusion model for this task, operating in the expression space of neural parametric head models, to synthesize audio-driven realistic head sequences. In the absence of a dataset with corresponding NPHM expressions to audio, we optimize for these correspondences to produce a dataset of temporally-optimized NPHM expressions fit to audio-video recordings of people talking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a generative approach for realistic and high-quality motion synthesis of volumetric human heads, representing a significant advancement in the field of audio-driven 3D animation. Notably, our approach stands out in its ability to generate plausible motion sequences that can produce high-fidelity head animation coupled with the NPHM shape space. Our experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of FaceTalk, consistently achieving superior and visually natural motion, encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles, outperforming existing methods by 75% in perceptual user study evaluation.</description>

      <title>A survey of synthetic data augmentation methods in computer vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to tackling computer vision problems is to train deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models using large-scale image datasets which are representative of the target task. However, in many scenarios, it is often challenging to obtain sufficient image data for the target task. Data augmentation is a way to mitigate this challenge. A common practice is to explicitly transform existing images in desired ways so as to create the required volume and variability of training data necessary to achieve good generalization performance. In situations where data for the target domain is not accessible, a viable workaround is to synthesize training data from scratch--i.e., synthetic data augmentation. This paper presents an extensive review of synthetic data augmentation techniques. It covers data synthesis approaches based on realistic 3D graphics modeling, neural style transfer (NST), differential neural rendering, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). For each of these classes of methods, we focus on the important data generation and augmentation techniques, general scope of application and specific use-cases, as well as existing limitations and possible workarounds. Additionally, we provide a summary of common synthetic datasets for training computer vision models, highlighting the main features, application domains and supported tasks. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of synthetic data augmentation methods. Since this is the first paper to explore synthetic data augmentation methods in great detail, we are hoping to equip readers with the necessary background information and in-depth knowledge of existing methods and their attendant issues.</description>
