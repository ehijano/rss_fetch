      <title>Evolution of linear matter perturbations with error-bounded bundle physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of linear matter perturbations in the context of the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) and a phenomenological modified gravity model. We use the physics-informed neural network (PINN) bundle method, which allows to integrate differential systems as an alternative to the traditional numerical method. We apply the PINN bundle method to the equation that describes the matter perturbation evolution, to compare its outcomes with recent data on structure growth, $f\sigma_8$. Unlike our previous works, we can calculate a bound on the error of this observable without using the numerical solution of the equation. For this, we use a method developed previously by ourselves to calculate an exact bound on the PINN-based solution using only the outcomes of the network and its residual. On the other hand, the use of an updated data set allows us to obtain more stringent constraints on the plane $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ than previous works.</description>

      <title>Oscillations and parity violation in gravitational wave background from extra tensor modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover, parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be detected with future GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.</description>

      <title>Halo Occupation Distribution of Quasars: Dependence on Luminosity, Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08851v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias (a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the varying electron mass and early dark energy in light of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 and the implications for inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primarily motivated by the Hubble tension, we analyze the varying electron mass model and axionlike early dark energy model (EDE) using baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2 data and including the recent results from ACT DR6. Our analysis indicates that $m_{e} / m_{e0} = 1.0081 \pm 0.0046 $ and the energy fraction of EDE is constrained as $f_\mathrm{EDE} &lt; 0.016$. Since those cosmological models fit with different spectral index $n_s$, we show the posterior of those models on the ($n_s-r$) plane and point out that, for example, Starobinsky inflation works for varying electron mass model while the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation is preferred in the EDE model.</description>

      <title>Study of the Connected Four-Point Correlation Function of Galaxies from DESI Data Release 1 Luminous Red Galaxy Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function (4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the gravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a significance of 14.7$\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness of this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and cross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch combinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness of the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation schemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce biases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield consistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF on the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data implies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the connected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The methodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a foundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.</description>

      <title>Tracing Large Scale Structure Morphology with Multiwavelength Line Intensity Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the large scale structure (LSS) in the post-reionisation era. This captures the integrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources within a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line emissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal complementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the underlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect the clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the cosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the percolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the post-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through percolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy distribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and sheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological measure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased filamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map. We attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased environments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of the $21$-cm signal at $z \lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at these redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected to increase up to $\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the local dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise, considering SKA-Mid observations.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Parity-Violating Modes of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 Luminous Red Galaxies' 4-Point Correlation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the first measurement of the parity-violating (PV) 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Year 1 Luminous Red Galaxy (DESI Y1 LRG) sample, motivated by the potential detection of the PV 4PCF in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS BOSS) galaxies. In our auto-correlation ("auto") analysis, we find a statistically significant excess of the PV signal compared to mocks without any PV, at 4-10$\sigma$ depending on details of the analysis. This could arise either from genuine PV or from an underestimation of the variance in the mocks; it is unlikely to arise, at the signal level, from a systematic. We then cross-correlate ("cross") the putative PV signal between different, independent patches of sky, and there find no detection of parity violation. The two measurements are in significant tension: while the cross has somewhat larger error bars than the auto, this is not sufficient to explain the discrepancy. We thus present the current work as an intriguing addition to the PV work on BOSS and as motivation for exploring further the relationship between the auto and cross PV 4PCF analyses.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of Strong Lensing from a Galaxy Cluster at Cosmic Noon: Giant Arcs and a Highly Concentrated Core of XLSSC 122</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have made the remarkable discovery of strong gravitational lensing arcs from XLSSC 122 ($z=1.98$) - setting the record for the most distant galaxy cluster that exhibits strong lensing. The discovery of giant arcs enables a strong-lensing analysis and a measurement of the concentration of the dark matter halo. We perform a strong-lensing analysis of the cluster and measure the radial projected mass density profile. Our measurements reveal an exceptionally high concentration in the core of XLSSC 122. A Navarro--Frenk--White profile fit to the inner 100 kpc estimates the concentration to be $6.3\pm0.5$. The high concentration of XLSSC 122 contributes to the emerging picture that massive structure formation in the early universe may proceed more rapidly than standard models suggest. We estimate the mass within 100 kpc to be $M$($R&lt;$100 kpc) = $6.5\pm0.7\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$. Our mosaic images are made public at https://kylefinner.github.io/xlssc122 .</description>

      <title>Super-heated first order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study first order phase transitions that occur when the temperature of the system increases and we identify the conditions that lead to super-heating, a phase where the system can heat up arbitrarily. First order phase transitions with super-heating behave as inverse transitions. We quantify these claims by studying a prototypical example of a dark sector with a large number of interacting light bosons at finite temperature. Depending upon thermalisation, a super-heated phase transition in cosmology is often associated with another transition when the system is eventually cooling down, enriching the spectrum of gravitational waves from bubble collisions.</description>

      <title>On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization -- influence on the metal and dust content of low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations indicate that high-redshift galaxies undergo episodic star formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of galaxies at $z\geq\!5$ using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track gas-phase and stellar metallicities $(Z_\text{g}, Z_\star)$ and dust mass $(M_{\rm d})$ in dark matter haloes spanning $M_{\rm h} = 10^6 - 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, with $Z_{\rm g}$ declining sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid $Z_{\rm g}$ decline. Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at $z=7-10$, flattening the $Z_{\rm g}$-mass relation to $\simeq 0.03 - 0.04\,Z_\odot$. Dust production tracks $Z_{\rm g}$ but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos $(M_{\rm h}\sim 10^7\,M_\odot)$, where shallow potentials amplify the impact of feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach ($\nu$DSMC) is a method of solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the Early Universe, proposed to study the evolution of neutrinos under various cosmological setups. We formulate a complete $\nu$DSMC solver, incorporating the effects of the electron mass, neutrino oscillations, and quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of the electromagnetic plasma. We then apply it for performing precise calculations of neutrino decoupling in the standard cosmological scenario. We obtain the value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.0439\pm 0.0006$, in agreement with the state-of-the-art calculations.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF VIII -- Modeling SKYSURF Completeness Data for Comparison to the Hubble Space Telescope Exposure Time Calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately assessing image source completeness is critical for interpreting measurements on telescope data. Using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data from the Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$) archival project "SKYSURF", we model galaxy completeness as a function of the exposure time and background of an image. This is accomplished by adding simulated objects with varying magnitudes and sizes into these images, and determining the detection rate for each set of parameters. The fifty percent completeness results are then compared to the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC), in order to assess the differences between the STSCI ETC and our analysis of the archival data. Ultimately, we find that, for extended galaxies, the ETC predicts a 1-2 magnitudes fainter completeness limit than our data. We believe the difference is due to the ETC's flat surface brightness profiles being less accurate at predicting for extended sources compared to our more realistic profiles.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter within the dark photon portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the dark photon as a portal connecting to the dark sector in the case of Dirac fermion and complex scalar dark matter with masses up to 1 TeV. Both the dark photon and the $Z$ boson contribute to the dark matter annihilation and dark matter--nucleon scattering processes. We derive the lower limits on the dark parameters from thermal relic density. The corresponding spin-independent dark matter--proton cross sections are compared with the upper bounds set by direct detection. We explore the allowed regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with these constraints.</description>

      <title>On quantum creation of a toroidal universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.</description>

      <title>Inflation in $F(R)$ gravity models revisited after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which satisfies all ACT constraints.</description>

      <title>Tension between HST/JWST and $\Lambda$CDM Cosmology, PBH, and Antimatter in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent data released by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and, somewhat earlier, the data presented by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are commonly understood as a strong indication for breaking of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. It is argued in the presented work that massive primordial black holes (PBH) could seed galaxy and quasar formation in the very young universe as it has been conjectured in our paper of 1993 and resolve the tension induced by the JWST and the HST data with the standard cosmology. This point of view is presently supported by several recent works. The proposed mechanism of PBH formation leads to the log-normal mass spectrum of PBHs and predicts abundant antimatter population of our Galaxy, Milky Way. Both these predictions are in excellent agreement with astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Fully Interpretable Emulator for the Linear Matter Power Spectrum from Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully interpretable emulator for the linear matter power spectrum (MPS), constructed via a $physics$-$informed$ $symbolic$ $regression$ framework. By combining domain knowledge with a machine learning technique knows as genetic algorithms, we explore the space of analytic expressions to derive closed-form, smooth approximations of the MPS that match the accuracy of standard broadband reconstruction methodologies such as the Savitzky-Golay filter. Building upon this baseline, we incorporate fully transparent oscillatory corrections informed by the physics of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), achieving sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of cosmological scales ($k \in [10^{-5}, 1.5]~h/\mathrm{Mpc}$) with an average fractional error of $\sim0.3\%$ when tested against numerical spectra obtained from a Boltzmann solver. To extend the framework beyond $\Lambda$CDM, we introduce parametric deformations designed to capture characteristic signatures of modified gravity (MG) theories -- such as scale-dependent enhancements or suppressions of power -- without sacrificing interpretability. Using a representative $f(R)$ gravity model, we demonstrate that these extensions effectively trace the overall modulation of the MPS, allowing us to analyze the impact of MG theories on the BAO scale. Our results provide compact, accurate, and physically motivated fitting functions for the linear MPS in both standard and MG cosmologies, offering a fast and transparent alternative to existing emulators for parameter inference and theoretical modeling in large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-IGM connection in THESAN: the physics connecting the IGM Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity and galaxy density in the reionization epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation between the Lyman-$\alpha$ effective optical depth of quasar sightlines ($\tau_\mathrm{los}$) and the distribution of galaxies around them is an emerging probe of the connection between the first collapsed structures and the IGM properties at the tail end of cosmic reionization. We employ the THESAN simulations to demonstrate that $\tau_\mathrm{los}$ is most sensitive to galaxies at a redshift-dependent distance, reflecting the growth of ionized regions around sources of photons and in agreement with studies of the galaxy--Lyman-$\alpha$ cross correlation. This is $d \sim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ at the tail end of reionization. The flagship THESAN run struggles to reproduce the most opaque sightlines as well as those with large galaxy densities, likely as a consequence of its limited volume. We identify a promising region of parameter space to probe with future observations in order to distinguish both the timing and sources of reionization. We present an investigation of the IGM physical conditions around opaque and transparent spectra, revealing that they probe regions that reionized inside-out and outside-in, respectively, and demonstrate that residual neutral islands at the end of reionization are not required to produce optical depths of $\tau_\mathrm{los} &gt; 4$, although they facilitate the task. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of the aforementioned results to the nature of ionizing sources and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies within the family of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, where the scalar field features an inhomogeneous profile but it preserves a translational symmetry that is realised as a combination of spatial translations and internal shifts. The spatial gradient of the scalar field introduces a preferred direction, so the resulting cosmologies are of the axisymmetric Bianchi I type. The momentum density of these configurations exhibits a universal evolution and an additional component with non-vanishing momentum density is required to have non-trivial effects. We show the relation of these scenarios with cosmologies of non-comoving components and, in particular, we explain how they provide a specific realisation of moving dark energy models. Among the class of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, we analyse in more detail the case of Kinetic Gravity Braiding with emphasis on its application to moving dark energy models and its effects on large scale dark flows as well as the CMB dipole and quadrupole.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Infrared Background Tomography and a Census of Cosmic Dust and Star Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) encodes dust emission from all galaxies and carries valuable information on structure formation, star formation, and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. However, its redshift-dependent spectrum remains poorly constrained due to line-of-sight projection effects. We address this by cross-correlating 11 far-infrared intensity maps spanning a 50-fold frequency range from Planck, Herschel, and IRAS, with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars from SDSS I-IV tomographically. We mitigate foregrounds using CSFD, a CIB-free Milky Way dust map. These cross-correlation amplitudes on two-halo scales trace bias-weighted CIB redshift distributions and collectively yield a $60\sigma$ detection of the evolving CIB spectrum, sampled across hundreds of rest-frame frequencies over $0 &lt; z &lt; 4$. We break the bias-intensity degeneracy by adding monopole information from FIRAS+Planck. The recovered spectrum reveals a dust temperature distribution that is broad, spanning the full range of host environments, and moderately evolving. Using low-frequency CIB amplitudes, we constrain cosmic dust density, $\Omega_{\rm dust}$, which peaks at $z = 1$-$1.5$ and declines threefold to the present. Our broad spectral coverage enables a determination of the total infrared luminosity density to 0.04 dex statistical precision, tracing star-formation history with negligible cosmic variance across 90% of cosmic time. We find that cosmic star formation is 80% dust-obscured at $z = 0$ and 60% at $z = 4$. Our results, based on intensity mapping, are complete, requiring no extrapolation to faint galaxies or low-surface-brightness components. We release our tomographic CIB spectrum and redshift distributions as a public resource for future studies of the CIB, both as a cosmological matter tracer and CMB foreground.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity realizations of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy within modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent observational datasets. Starting from a general effective field theory formulation of dark energy in metric-affine geometry, we derive the background action in unitary gauge and we demonstrate how both $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravity can naturally realize quintom behavior through appropriate forms and parameter choices. Additionally, using the Gaussian process reconstruction of the latest DESI DR2 BAO data combined with SNe and CMB observations, we extract the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, showing that it exhibits quintom-type evolution, crossing the phantom divide from below. Moreover, through detailed parameter estimations and application of information criteria, we compare the model with the quadratic one and the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results show that, due to its rich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the realization of the data-favoured dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>What it takes to solve the Hubble tension through scale-dependent modifications of the primordial power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate scale-dependent modifications to the primordial scalar power spectrum as potential solutions to the Hubble tension. We use the Fisher-bias formalism, recently adapted to examine perturbed recombination solutions to the Hubble tension, and extend its range of validity with an iterative method. We first analyze the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data, demonstrating the existence of modifications to the primordial power spectrum capable of fully resolving the tension between Planck and SH0ES. As a proof of concept, we interpret these solutions in terms of small, time-dependent variations in the first slow roll parameter or in the sound speed of curvature perturbations during a stage of primordial inflation. However, these solutions are associated with a low total matter density $\Omega_m$, which makes them inconsistent with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and uncalibrated supernovae (SNIa) data. When incorporating additional BOSS and PantheonPlus data, the solutions that reduce the Hubble tension tend to overfit Planck CMB data to compensate for the worsened fit to BAO and SNIa data, making them less compelling. These findings suggest that modifying the primordial power spectrum alone is unlikely to provide a robust resolution to the tension and highlight how the viability of such data-driven solutions depends on the specific datasets considered, emphasizing the role of future high-precision observations in further constraining possible resolutions to the tension.</description>

      <title>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the first-order electroweak phase transition in the background of a hypermagnetic field with three-dimensional lattice simulation. The generation of baryon asymmetry is observed, and we present the relationship between baryon number asymmetry and magnetic field strength and its helicity. We find the magnetic field strength required to achieve the correct matter-antimatter asymmetry is about $10^{-17}\sim10^{-14}$ Gauss at present, depending on the correlation length of the helical magnetic field. This study provides a mechanism for explaining the baryon number asymmetry with cosmic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>BayeSN and SALT: A Comparison of Dust Inference Across SN Ia Light-curve Models with DES5YR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant debate around the impact of dust on SNe Ia, a major source of uncertainty in cosmological analyses. We perform the first validation of the probabilistic hierarchical SN Ia SED model BayeSN on the conventional SALT model, an important test given the history of conflicting conclusions regarding the distributions of host galaxy dust properties between the two. Applying BayeSN to SALT-based simulations, we find that BayeSN is able to accurately recover our simulated inputs and successfully disentangle differences in dust extinction from an intrinsic mass step. This validates BayeSN as a method to identify the relative contributions of dust and intrinsic differences in explaining the mass step. When inferring dust parameters with simulated samples including non-Ia contamination, we find that our choice of photometric classifier causes a bias in the inferred dust distribution; this arises because SNe Ia heavily impacted by dust are misclassified as contaminants and excluded. We then apply BayeSN to the sample of SNe from DES5YR to jointly infer host galaxy dust distributions and intrinsic differences on either side of the `mass step' at $10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find evidence in favour of an intrinsic contribution to the mass step and differing $R_V$ distributions. We also build on recent results supporting an environmental-dependence on the secondary maximum of SNe Ia in $i$-band. Twenty days post-peak, we find an offset in intrinsic $i$-band light curve between each mass bin at a significance in excess of $3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.</description>

Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>
