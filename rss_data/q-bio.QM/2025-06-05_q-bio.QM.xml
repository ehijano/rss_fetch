      <title>Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza, anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result, structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.</description>

      <title>The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold -- much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions -- such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide -- but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.</description>

      <title>PixCell: A generative foundation model for digital histopathology images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&amp;E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&amp;E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&amp;E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</description>
