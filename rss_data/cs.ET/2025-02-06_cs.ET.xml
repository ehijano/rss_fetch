      <title>Implementing Large Quantum Boltzmann Machines as Generative AI Models for Dataset Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of large Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (QRBMs), a key advancement in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as generative models on D-Wave's Pegasus quantum hardware to address dataset imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging Pegasus's enhanced connectivity and computational capabilities, a QRBM with 120 visible and 120 hidden units was successfully embedded, surpassing the limitations of default embedding tools. The QRBM synthesized over 1.6 million attack samples, achieving a balanced dataset of over 4.2 million records. Comparative evaluations with traditional balancing methods, such as SMOTE and RandomOversampler, revealed that QRBMs produced higher-quality synthetic samples, significantly improving detection rates, precision, recall, and F1 score across diverse classifiers. The study underscores the scalability and efficiency of QRBMs, completing balancing tasks in milliseconds. These findings highlight the transformative potential of QML and QRBMs as next-generation tools in data preprocessing, offering robust solutions for complex computational challenges in modern information systems.</description>

      <title>Experiments with an oscillator based Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03167v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in non-algorithmic, unconventional computing is rising in recent years due to more and more apparent short comings of classic stored-program digital computers, such as energy efficiency, degree of parallelism in computations, clock frequency limitations, integration density, silicon utilization, etc. One notable such unconventional approach are oscillator based Ising machines, i.e., systems consisting of a number of oscillators which can be coupled in order to create an analogue for some problem to be solved, while the actual information is encoded in the phase relationships of these oscillators with respect to some reference (typically one of these oscillators). It has been shown that machines of this type are capable of solving NP-hard problems such as max-cut, etc. In the following an experimental Ising machine is presented together with experimental results obtained from this machine.</description>

      <title>TensorQC: Towards Scalable Distributed Quantum Computing via Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum processing unit (QPU) must contain a large number of high quality qubits to produce accurate results for problems at useful scales. In contrast, most scientific and industry classical computation workloads happen in parallel on distributed systems, which rely on copying data across multiple cores. Unfortunately, copying quantum data is theoretically prohibited due to the quantum non-cloning theory. Instead, quantum circuit cutting techniques cut a large quantum circuit into multiple smaller subcircuits, distribute the subcircuits on parallel QPUs and reconstruct the results with classical computing. Such techniques make distributed hybrid quantum computing (DHQC) a possibility but also introduce an exponential classical co-processing cost in the number of cuts and easily become intractable. This paper presents TensorQC, which leverages classical tensor networks to bring an exponential runtime advantage over state-of-the-art parallelization post-processing techniques. As a result, this paper demonstrates running benchmarks that are otherwise intractable for a standalone QPU and prior circuit cutting techniques. Specifically, this paper runs six realistic benchmarks using QPUs available nowadays and a single GPU, and reduces the QPU size and quality requirements by more than $10\times$ over purely quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>xai_evals : A Framework for Evaluating Post-Hoc Local Explanation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning and deep learning models has led to an increased reliance on opaque "black box" systems, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind predictions. This lack of transparency is particularly challenging in high-stakes applications where interpretability is as important as accuracy. Post-hoc explanation methods are commonly used to interpret these models, but they are seldom rigorously evaluated, raising concerns about their reliability. The Python package xai_evals addresses this by providing a comprehensive framework for generating, benchmarking, and evaluating explanation methods across both tabular and image data modalities. It integrates popular techniques like SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients (IG), and Backtrace, while supporting evaluation metrics such as faithfulness, sensitivity, and robustness. xai_evals enhances the interpretability of machine learning models, fostering transparency and trust in AI systems. The library is open-sourced at https://pypi.org/project/xai-evals/ .</description>

      <title>Accurate AI-Driven Emergency Vehicle Location Tracking in Healthcare ITS Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a Digital Twin (DT) for Healthcare Intelligent Transportation Systems (HITS) is a hot research trend focusing on enhancing HITS management, particularly in emergencies where ambulance vehicles must arrive at the crash scene on time and track their real-time location is crucial to the medical authorities. Despite the claim of real-time representation, a temporal misalignment persists between the physical and virtual domains, leading to discrepancies in the ambulance's location representation. This study proposes integrating AI predictive models, specifically Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), within a constructed mock DT data pipeline framework to anticipate the medical vehicle's next location in the virtual world. These models align virtual representations with their physical counterparts, i.e., metaphorically offsetting the synchronization delay between the two worlds. Trained meticulously on a historical geospatial dataset, SVR and DNN exhibit exceptional prediction accuracy in MATLAB and Python environments. Through various testing scenarios, we visually demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology, showcasing SVR and DNN's key role in significantly reducing the witnessed gap within the HITS's DT. This transformative approach enhances real-time synchronization in emergency HITS by approximately 88% to 93%.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Blockchain-IPFS Solution for Secure and Scalable Data Collection and Storage for Smart Water Meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable and secure data management is important in Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart water meters, where traditional blockchain storage can be restrictive due to high data volumes. This paper investigates a hybrid blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) approach designed to optimise storage efficiency, enhance throughput, and reduce block time by offloading large data off-chain to IPFS while preserving on-chain integrity. A substrate-based private blockchain was developed to store smart water meter (SWM) data, and controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate blockchain performance with and without IPFS. Key metrics, including block size, block time, and transaction throughput, were analysed across varying data volumes and node counts. Results show that integrating IPFS significantly reduces on-chain storage demands, leading to smaller block sizes, increased throughput, and improved block times compared to blockchain-only storage. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid blockchain-IPFS models for efficiently and securely managing high-volume IoT data.</description>

      <title>Multi Ratio Shift Keying (MRSK) for Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) leverages the power of diffusion to transmit molecules from a transmitter to a receiver. A wide variety of modulation techniques based on molecule concentration, type, and release time have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel modulation technique that encodes the information into the relative concentrations of multiple molecules called Multi Ratio Shift Keying (MRSK) designed for diffusion-based MC without drift. We show that leveraging all possible ratios in a set of molecules can help mitigate the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) and provide a flexible communication channel. To evaluate the performance of the MRSK, we develop a mathematical framework for studying the statistics of the ratio of random variables, focusing on noncentral Gaussian distributions. We then assess MRSK performance both analytically and through particle-based simulations under various channel conditions, identifying potential sources of error in our system model. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of commonly used modulation schemes in the literature based on bit error rate (BER). The results show that MRSK significantly outperforms all traditional modulation schemes considered in this study in terms of BER. MRSK offers a promising, flexible, and more reliable communication method for the future of the MC paradigm.</description>

      <title>Conversation Routines: A Prompt Engineering Framework for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom functions (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on prompt engineering frameworks driven by goal-oriented grading criteria, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and enhancing system robustness to address the identified limitations across diverse business applications.</description>

      <title>Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.</description>
