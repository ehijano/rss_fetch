      <title>$\Sigma_n$-correct Forcing Axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce a new family of axioms extending ZFC set theory, the $\Sigma_n$-correct forcing axioms. These assert roughly that whenever a forcing name $\dot{a}$ can be forced by a poset in some forcing class $\Gamma$ to have some $\Sigma_n$ property $\phi$ which is provably preserved by all further forcing in $\Gamma$, then $\dot{a}$ reflects to some small name such that there is already in $V$ a filter which interprets that small name so that $\phi$ holds. $\Sigma_1$-correct forcing axioms turn out to be equivalent to classical forcing axioms, while $\Sigma_2$-correct forcing axioms for $\Sigma_2$-definable forcing classes are consistent relative to a supercompact cardinal (and in fact hold in the standard model of a classical forcing axiom constructed as an extension of a model with a supercompact), $\Sigma_3$-correct forcing axioms are consistent relative to an extendible cardinal, and more generally $\Sigma_n$-correct forcing axioms are consistent relative to a hierarchy of large cardinals generalizing supercompactness and extendibility whose supremum is the first-order version of Vopenka's Principle.
  By analogy to classical forcing axioms, there is also a hierarchy of $\Sigma_n$-correct bounded forcing axioms which are consistent relative to appropriate large cardinals. At the two lowest levels of this hierarchy, outright equiconsistency results are easy to obtain. Beyond these consistency results, I also study when $\Sigma_n$-correct forcing axioms are preserved by forcing, how they relate to previously studied axioms and to each other, and some of their mathematical implications.</description>

      <title>On the logical structure of some maximality and well-foundedness principles equivalent to choice principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the logical structure of Teichm{\"u}ller-Tukey lemma, a maximality principle equivalent to the axiom of choice and show that it corresponds to the generalisation to arbitrary cardinals of update induction, a well-foundedness principle from constructive mathematics classically equivalent to the axiom of dependent choice.From there, we state general forms of maximality and well-foundedness principles equivalent to the axiom of choice, including a variant of Zorn's lemma. A comparison with the general class of choice and bar induction principles given by Brede and the first author is initiated.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Quasi-Dense Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decidability of axiomatic extensions of the modal logic K with modal reduction principles, i.e. axioms of the form $\Diamond^{k} p \rightarrow \Diamond^{n} p$, has remained a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we make significant progress toward solving this problem and show that decidability holds for a large subclass of these logics, namely, for 'quasi-dense logics.' Such logics are extensions of K with with modal reduction axioms such that $0 &lt; k &lt; n$ (dubbed 'quasi-density axioms'). To prove decidability, we define novel proof systems for quasi-dense logics consisting of disjunctive existential rules, which are first-order formulae typically used to specify ontologies in the context of database theory. We show that such proof systems can be used to generate proofs and models of modal formulae, and provide an intricate model-theoretic argument showing that such generated models can be encoded as finite objects called 'templates.' By enumerating templates of bound size, we obtain an EXPSPACE decision procedure as a consequence.</description>

      <title>On the first order theory of plactic monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves that a plactic monoid of any finite rank will have decidable first order theory. This resolves other open decidability problems about the finite rank plactic monoids, such as the Diophantine problem and identity checking. This is achieved by interpreting a plactic monoid of arbitrary rank in Presburger arithmetic, which is known to have decidable first order theory. We also prove that the interpretation of the plactic monoids into Presburger Arithmetic is in fact a bi-interpretation, hence any two plactic monoids of finite rank are bi-interpretable with one another. The algorithm generating the interpretations is uniform, which answers positively the decidability of the Diophantine problem for the infinite rank plactic monoid.</description>

      <title>Multicontact semilattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize those join semilattices with a multicontact relation which can be embedded into (the reduct of) a Boolean algebra with multicontact given by overlap, equivalently, into a distributive lattice with additive multicontact, still equivalently, into the multicontact semilattice associated to some topological space. A similar characterization is presented for embeddability into Boolean algebras or distributive lattices with a not necessarily overlap nor additive multicontact.</description>

      <title>The Pebble-Relation Comonad in Finite Model Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08196v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pebbling comonad, introduced by Abramsky, Dawar and Wang, provides a categorical interpretation for the k-pebble games from finite model theory. The coKleisli category of the pebbling comonad specifies equivalences under different fragments and extensions of infinitary k-variable logic. Moreover, the coalgebras over this pebbling comonad characterise treewidth and correspond to tree decompositions. In this paper we introduce the pebble-relation comonad, which characterises pathwidth and whose coalgebras correspond to path decompositions. We further show that the existence of a coKleisli morphism in this comonad is equivalent to truth preservation in the restricted conjunction fragment of k-variable infinitary logic. We do this using Dalmau's pebble-relation game and an equivalent all-in-one pebble game. We then provide a similar treatment to the corresponding coKleisli isomorphisms via a bijective version of the all-in-one pebble game. Finally, we show as a consequence a new Lov\'asz-type theorem relating pathwidth to the restricted conjunction fragment of k-variable infinitary logic with counting quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Strict universes for Grothendieck topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofmann and Streicher famously showed how to lift Grothendieck universes into presheaf topoi, and Streicher has extended their result to the case of sheaf topoi by sheafification. In parallel, van den Berg and Moerdijk have shown in the context of algebraic set theory that similar constructions continue to apply even in weaker metatheories. Unfortunately, sheafification seems not to preserve an important realignment property enjoyed by the presheaf universes that plays a critical role in models of univalent type theory as well as synthetic Tait computability, a recent technique to establish syntactic properties of type theories and programming languages. In the context of multiple universes, the realignment property also implies a coherent choice of codes for connectives at each universe level, thereby interpreting the cumulativity laws present in popular formulations of Martin-L\"of type theory.
  We observe that a slight adjustment to an argument of Shulman constructs a cumulative universe hierarchy satisfying the realignment property at every level in any Grothendieck topos. Hence one has direct-style interpretations of Martin-L\"of type theory with cumulative universes into all Grothendieck topoi. A further implication is to extend the reach of recent synthetic methods in the semantics of cubical type theory and the syntactic metatheory of type theory and programming languages to all Grothendieck topoi.</description>
