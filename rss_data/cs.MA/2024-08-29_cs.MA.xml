      <title>Graph Attention Inference of Network Topology in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately identifying the underlying graph structures of multi-agent systems remains a difficult challenge. Our work introduces a novel machine learning-based solution that leverages the attention mechanism to predict future states of multi-agent systems by learning node representations. The graph structure is then inferred from the strength of the attention values. This approach is applied to both linear consensus dynamics and the non-linear dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators, resulting in implicit learning the graph by learning good agent representations. Our results demonstrate that the presented data-driven graph attention machine learning model can identify the network topology in multi-agent systems, even when the underlying dynamic model is not known, as evidenced by the F1 scores achieved in the link prediction.</description>

      <title>Different Facets for Different Experts: A Framework for Streamlining The Integration of Qualitative Insights into ABM Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key problem in agent-based simulation is that integrating qualitative insights from multiple discipline experts is extremely hard. In most simulations, agent capabilities and corresponding behaviour needs to be programmed into the agent. We report on the architecture of a tool that disconnects the programmed functions of the agent, from the acquisition of capability and displayed behaviour. This allows multiple different domain experts to represent qualitative insights, without the need for code to be changed. It also allows a continuous integration (or even change) of qualitative behaviour processes, as more insights are gained. The consequent behaviour observed in the model is both, more faithful to the expert's insight as well as able to be contrasted against other models representing other insights.</description>

      <title>TrafficGamer: Reliable and Flexible Traffic Simulation for Safety-Critical Scenarios with Game-Theoretic Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modern Autonomous Vehicle (AV) systems can develop reliable driving policies under regular traffic conditions, they frequently struggle with safety-critical traffic scenarios. This difficulty primarily arises from the rarity of such scenarios in driving datasets and the complexities associated with predictive modeling among multiple vehicles. To support the testing and refinement of AV policies, simulating safety-critical traffic events is an essential challenge to be addressed. In this work, we introduce TrafficGamer, which facilitates game-theoretic traffic simulation by viewing common road driving as a multi-agent game. In evaluating the empirical performance across various real-world datasets, TrafficGamer ensures both fidelity and exploitability of the simulated scenarios, guaranteeing that they not only statically align with real-world traffic distribution but also efficiently capture equilibriums for representing safety-critical scenarios involving multiple agents. Additionally, the results demonstrate that TrafficGamer exhibits highly flexible simulation across various contexts. Specifically, we demonstrate that the generated scenarios can dynamically adapt to equilibriums of varying tightness by configuring risk-sensitive constraints during optimization. To the best of our knowledge, TrafficGamer is the first simulator capable of generating diverse traffic scenarios involving multiple agents. We have provided a demo webpage for the project at https://qiaoguanren.github.io/trafficgamer-demo/.</description>

      <title>Component reusability evaluation and requirement tracing for agent-based cyber-physical-simulated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09565v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating early design concepts is crucial as it impacts quality and cost. This process is often hindered by vague and uncertain design information. This article introduces the SysML-based Simulated-Physical Systems Modeling Language (SPSysML). It is a Domain-Specification Language used to evaluate component reusability in cyber-physical systems, incorporating digital twins and other simulated parts. The proposed factors assess the design quantitatively. SPSysML uses a requirement-based system structuring method to couple simulated and physical parts with requirements. SPSysML enables DTs to perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world.
  SPSysML validation is survey- and application-based. First, a robotic system for an assisted living project was developed. The integrity of simulated and physical parts of the system is improved using SPSysML-based quantitative evaluation. Thus, more system components are shared between the simulated and physical setups. The system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) or ROS2. SPSysML was used by a third-party developer and was assessed by him and other practitioners in a survey.</description>
