      <title>Community Detection with Heterogeneous Block Covariance Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the task of clustering objects based on their pairwise relationships. Most of the model-based community detection methods, such as the stochastic block model and its variants, are designed for networks with binary (yes/no) edges. In many practical scenarios, edges often possess continuous weights, spanning positive and negative values, which reflect varying levels of connectivity. To address this challenge, we introduce the heterogeneous block covariance model (HBCM) that defines a community structure within the covariance matrix, where edges have signed and continuous weights. Furthermore, it takes into account the heterogeneity of objects when forming connections with other objects within a community. A novel variational expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to estimate the group membership. The HBCM provides provable consistent estimates of memberships, and its promising performance is observed in numerical simulations with different setups. The model is applied to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of a mouse embryo and a stock price dataset. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</description>

      <title>Pathwise optimization for bridge-type estimators and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse parametric models are of great interest in statistical learning and are often analyzed by means of regularized estimators. Pathwise methods allow to efficiently compute the full solution path for penalized estimators, for any possible value of the penalization parameter $\lambda$. In this paper we deal with the pathwise optimization for bridge-type problems; i.e. we are interested in the minimization of a loss function, such as negative log-likelihood or residual sum of squares, plus the sum of $\ell^q$ norms with $q\in(0,1]$ involving adpative coefficients. For some loss functions this regularization achieves asymptotically the oracle properties (such as the selection consistency). Nevertheless, since the objective function involves nonconvex and nondifferentiable terms, the minimization problem is computationally challenging.
  The aim of this paper is to apply some general algorithms, arising from nonconvex optimization theory, to compute efficiently the path solutions for the adaptive bridge estimator with multiple penalties. In particular, we take into account two different approaches: accelerated proximal gradient descent and blockwise alternating optimization. The convergence and the path consistency of these algorithms are discussed. In order to assess our methods, we apply these algorithms to the penalized estimation of diffusion processes observed at discrete times. This latter represents a recent research topic in the field of statistics for time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>Elements of Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.04797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A core problem in statistics and probabilistic machine learning is to compute probability distributions and expectations. This is the fundamental problem of Bayesian statistics and machine learning, which frames all inference as expectations with respect to the posterior distribution. The key challenge is to approximate these intractable expectations. In this tutorial, we review sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), a random-sampling-based class of methods for approximate inference. First, we explain the basics of SMC, discuss practical issues, and review theoretical results. We then examine two of the main user design choices: the proposal distributions and the so called intermediate target distributions. We review recent results on how variational inference and amortization can be used to learn efficient proposals and target distributions. Next, we discuss the SMC estimate of the normalizing constant, how this can be used for pseudo-marginal inference and inference evaluation. Throughout the tutorial we illustrate the use of SMC on various models commonly used in machine learning, such as stochastic recurrent neural networks, probabilistic graphical models, and probabilistic programs.</description>

      <title>AdamMCMC: Combining Metropolis Adjusted Langevin with Momentum-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key issue when considering the application of deep neural network methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that quantifies epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling from a tempered posterior distribution. It combines the well established Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) with momentum-based optimization using Adam and leverages a prolate proposal distribution, to efficiently draw from the posterior. We prove that the constructed chain admits the Gibbs posterior as invariant distribution and approximates this posterior in total variation distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm and the merit of the proposed changes on a state-of-the-art classifier from high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <title>Spatial Weather, Socio-Economic and Political Risks in Probabilistic Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasts of the impact of spatial weather and pan-European socio-economic and political risks on hourly electricity demand for the mid-term horizon are crucial for strategic decision-making amidst the inherent uncertainty. Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the operational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary challenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted drivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual, and holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive effects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political effects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity. To address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term forecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic effects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational dependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled socio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting. Built from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables an analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the hour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries reliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European electricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric heating adoption.</description>

      <title>A Model-Constrained Discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) for Compressible Euler Equations with Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are critically needed for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications, particularly in digital twin contexts. In this work, we develop a model-constrained discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) approach, a significant extension to our previous work [Model-constrained Tagent Slope Learning Approach for Dynamical Systems], for compressible Euler equations with out-of-distribution generalization. The core of DGNet is the synergy of several key strategies: (i) leveraging time integration schemes to capture temporal correlation and taking advantage of neural network speed for computation time reduction; (ii) employing a model-constrained approach to ensure the learned tangent slope satisfies governing equations; (iii) utilizing a GNN-inspired architecture where edges represent Riemann solver surrogate models and nodes represent volume integration correction surrogate models, enabling capturing discontinuity capability, aliasing error reduction, and mesh discretization generalizability; (iv) implementing the input normalization technique that allows surrogate models to generalize across different initial conditions, geometries, meshes, boundary conditions, and solution orders; and (v) incorporating a data randomization technique that not only implicitly promotes agreement between surrogate models and true numerical models up to second-order derivatives, ensuring long-term stability and prediction capacity, but also serves as a data generation engine during training, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen data. To validate the effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of our novel DGNet approach, we present comprehensive numerical results for 1D and 2D compressible Euler equation problems.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Personalization in FedProx: A Fine-grained Analysis on Statistical Accuracy and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FedProx is a simple yet effective federated learning method that enables model personalization via regularization. Despite remarkable success in practice, a rigorous analysis of how such a regularization provably improves the statistical accuracy of each client's local model hasn't been fully established. Setting the regularization strength heuristically presents a risk, as an inappropriate choice may even degrade accuracy. This work fills in the gap by analyzing the effect of regularization on statistical accuracy, thereby providing a theoretical guideline for setting the regularization strength for achieving personalization. We prove that by adaptively choosing the regularization strength under different statistical heterogeneity, FedProx can consistently outperform pure local training and achieve a \textit{minimax-optimal} statistical rate. In addition, to shed light on resource allocation, we design an algorithm, provably showing that stronger personalization reduces communication complexity without increasing the computation cost overhead. Finally, our theory is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and its generalizability is verified in a non-convex setting.</description>
