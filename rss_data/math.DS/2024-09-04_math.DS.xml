      <title>Transverse foliations for two-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-degree-of-freedom mechanical system for energies slightly above a critical value. The critical set of the potential function is assumed to contain a finite number of saddle points. As the energy increases across the critical value, a disk-like component of the Hill region gets connected to other components precisely at the saddles. Under certain convexity assumptions on the critical set, we show the existence of a weakly convex foliation in the region of the energy surface where the interesting dynamics takes place. The binding of the foliation is formed by the index-$2$ Lyapunov orbits in the neck region about the rest points and a particular index-$3$ orbit. Among other dynamical implications, the transverse foliation forces the existence of periodic orbits, homoclinics, and heteroclinics to the Lyapunov orbits. We apply the results to the H\'enon-Heiles potential for energies slightly above $1/6$. We also discuss the existence of transverse foliations for decoupled mechanical systems, including the frozen Hill's lunar problem with centrifugal force, the Stark problem, the Euler problem of two centers, and the potential of a chemical reaction.</description>

      <title>Polynomial shape adic systems are inherently expansive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study any dynamical system it is useful to find a partition that allows essentially faithful encoding (injective, up to a small exceptional set) into a subshift. Most topological and measure-theoretic systems can be represented by Bratteli-Vershik (or adic, or BV) systems. So it is natural to ask when can a BV system be encoded essentially faithfully. We show here that for BV diagrams defined by homogeneous positive integer multivariable polynomials, and a wide family of their generalizations, which we call polynomial shape diagrams, for every choice of the edge ordering the coding according to initial path segments of a fixed finite length is injective off of a negligible exceptional set.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic dynamics on amenable groups and van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergelson and Lesigne by showing that the notion of van der Corput set does not depend on the F\o lner sequence used to define it. This result has been discovered independently by Sa\'ul Rodr\'iguez Mart\'in. Both ours and Rodr\'iguez's proofs proceed by first establishing a converse to the Furstenberg Correspondence Principle for amenable groups.
  This involves studying the distributions of Reiter sequences over congruent sequences of tilings of the group.
  Lastly, we show that many of the equivalent characterizations of van der Corput sets in $\mathbb{N}$ that do not involve F\o lner sequences remain equivalent for arbitrary countably infinite groups.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to Mather quotient problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed, connected and orientable Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Consider a Lagrangian $L(x,v):TM\to\R$ defined by $L(x,v):=\frac 12g_x(v,v)-\omega(v)+c$, where $c\in\R$ and $\omega$ is a closed 1-form. From the perspective of differential geometry, we estimate the Laplacian of the weak KAM solution $u$ to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation $H(x,du)=c[L]$ in the barrier sense. This analysis enables us to prove that each weak KAM solution $u$ is constant if and only if $\omega$ is a harmonic 1-form. Furthermore, we explore several applications to the Mather quotient and Ma\~n\'e's Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>On the Use of the Schwarzian derivative in Real One-Dimensional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of properties within one-dimensional dynamics, the assumption of a negative Schwarzian derivative has been shown to be very useful. However, this condition may appear somewhat arbitrary, as it is not a dynamical condition in any sense other than that it is preserved for its iterates. In this brief work, we show that the assumption of a negative Schwarzian derivative it is not entirely arbitrary but rather strictly related to the fulfillment of the Minimum Principle for the derivative of the map and its iterates, which is the key point in the proof of Singer's Theorem.</description>

      <title>Distributions of periodic points for the Dyck shift and the heterochaos baker maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterochaos baker maps are piecewise affine maps on the square or the cube that are one of the simplest partially hyperbolic systems. The Dyck shift is a well-known example of a subshift that has two fully supported ergodic measures of maximal entropy (MMEs). We show that the two ergodic MMEs of the Dyck shift are represented as asymptotic distributions of sets of periodic points of different multipliers. We transfer this result to the heterochaos baker maps, and show that their two ergodic MMEs are represented as asymptotic distributions of sets of periodic points of different unstable dimensions.</description>

      <title>Conformal measures of (anti)holomorphic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and properties of conformal measures on limit sets of (anti)holomorphic correspondences. We show that if the critical exponent satisfies $1\leq \delta_{\operatorname{crit}}(x) &lt;+\infty,$ the correspondence $F$ is (relatively) hyperbolic on the limit set $\Lambda_+(x)$, and $\Lambda_+(x)$ is minimal, then $\Lambda_+(x)$ admits a non-atomic conformal measure for $F$ and the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda_+(x)$ is strictly less than 2. As a special case, this shows that for a parameter $a$ in the interior of a hyperbolic component of the modular Mandelbrot set, the limit set of the Bullett--Penrose correspondence $F_a$ has a non-atomic conformal measure and its Hausdorff dimension is strictly less than 2. The same results hold for the LLMM correspondences, under some extra assumptions on its defining function $f$.</description>

      <title>Global stability of first order endotactic reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction networks are a general framework widely used in modelling diverse phenomena in different science disciplines. The dynamical process of a reaction network endowed with mass-action kinetics is a mass-action system. In this paper we study dynamics of first order mass-action systems. We prove that every first order endotactic mass-action system has a weakly reversible deficiency zero realization, and has a unique equilibrium which is exponentially globally asymptotically stable (and is positive) in each (positive) stoichiometric compatibility class. In particular, we prove that global attractivity conjecture holds for every linear complex balanced mass-action system. In this way, we exclude the possibility of first order endotactic mass-action systems to admit multistationarity or multistability. The result indicates that the importance of binding molecules in reactants is crucial for (endotactic) reaction networks to have complicated dynamics like limit cycles. The proof relies on the fact that $\mathcal{A}$-endotacticity of first order reaction networks implies endotacticity for a finite set $\mathcal{A}$, which is also proved in this paper.
  Out of independent interest, we provide a sufficient condition for endotacticity of reaction networks which are not necessarily of first order.</description>

      <title>Complete regularity of linear cocycles and the Baire category of the set of Lyapunov-Perron regular points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a continuous linear cocycle $\mathcal{A}$ over a homeomorphism $f$ of a compact metric space $X$, we investigate its set $\mathcal{R}$ of Lyapunov-Perron regular points, that is, the collection of trajectories of $f$ that obey the conclusions of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem. We obtain results roughly saying that the set $\mathcal{R}$ is of first Baire category (i.e., meager) in $X$, unless some rigid structure is present. In some settings, this rigid structure forces the Lyapunov exponents to be defined everywhere and to be independent of the point; that is what we call complete regularity.</description>

      <title>Limit cycles bifurcating from periodic integral manifold in non-smooth differential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the perturbation of higher-dimensional non-smooth autonomous differential systems characterized by two zones separated by a codimension-one manifold, with an integral manifold foliated by crossing periodic solutions. Our primary focus is on developing the Melnikov method to analyze the emergence of limit cycles originating from the periodic integral manifold. While previous studies have explored the Melnikov method for autonomous perturbations of non-smooth differential systems with a linear switching manifold and with a periodic integral manifold, either open or of codimension 1, our work extends to non-smooth differential systems with a non-linear switching manifold and more general periodic integral manifolds, where the persistence of periodic orbits is of interest. We illustrate our findings through several examples, highlighting the applicability and significance of our main result.</description>

      <title>On the support of measures of large entropy for polynomial-like maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a polynomial-like map with dominant topological degree $d_t\geq 2$ and let $d_{k-1}&lt;d_t$ be its dynamical degree of order $k-1$. We show that the support of every ergodic measure whose measure-theoretic entropy is strictly larger than $\log \sqrt{d_{k-1} d_t}$ is supported on the Julia set, i.e., the support of the unique measure of maximal entropy $\mu$. The proof is based on the exponential speed of convergence of the measures $d_t^{-n}(f^n)^*\delta_a$ towards $\mu$, which is valid for a generic point $a$ and with a controlled error bound depending on $a$. Our proof also gives a new proof of the same statement in the setting of endomorphisms of $\mathbb P^k(\mathbb C)$ - a result due to de Th\'elin and Dinh - which does not rely on the existence of a Green current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of Boussinesq-type equations that not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that the solution to the primitive equations is predicted by the corresponding data assimilation(DA) equations in $H^2$. Although, the DA equation does not include the direct information about the base solution and its initial conditions, the solution to the DA equation exponentially convergence to the base(original) solution when the external forces are known even before they are observed. Additionally, when the external force is not completely known but its spatially dense observations are available, then the DA is stable, $i.e.$ the DA solution lies in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the base solution.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a mathematical model for malaria using data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, every year millions of people become victims of this disease and many even lose their lives. Medical professionals and the government could take accurate measures to protect the people only when the disease dynamics are understood clearly. In this work, we propose a compartmental model to study the dynamics of malaria. We consider the transmission rate dependent on temperature and altitude. We performed the steady state analysis on the proposed model and checked the stability of the disease-free and endemic steady state. An artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the formulated model to predict the trajectory of all five compartments following the mathematical analysis. Three different neural network architectures namely Artificial neural network (ANN), convolution neural network (CNN), and Recurrent neural network (RNN) are used to estimate these parameters from the trajectory of the data. To understand the severity of a disease, it is essential to calculate the risk associated with the disease. In this work, the risk is calculated using dynamic mode decomposition(DMD) from the trajectory of the infected people.</description>

      <title>An inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle and applications to van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we give characterizations of the notions of van der Corput (vdC) set, nice vdC set and set of nice recurrence (defined below) in countable amenable groups. This allows us to prove that nice vdC sets are sets of nice recurrence and that vdC sets are independent of the F{\o}lner sequence used to define them, answering questions from Bergelson and Lesigne in the context of countable amenable groups. We also give a spectral characterization of vdC sets in abelian groups. The methods developed in this paper allow us to establish a converse to the Furstenberg correspondence principle. In addition, we introduce vdC sets in general non amenable groups and establish some basic properties of them, such as partition regularity.
  Several results in this paper, including the converse to Furstenberg's correspondence principle, have also been proved independently by Robin Tucker-Drob and Sohail Farhangi in their article `Van der Corput sets in amenable groups and beyond', which is being uploaded to arXiv simultaneously to this one.</description>

Abstract: On a smooth closed manifold $M$, we introduce a novel theory of maximal slope curves for any pair $(\phi,H)$ with $\phi$ a semiconcave function and $H$ a Hamiltonian.
  By using the notion of maximal slope curve from gradient flow theory, the intrinsic singular characteristics constructed in [Cannarsa, P.; Cheng, W., \textit{Generalized characteristics and Lax-Oleinik operators: global theory}. Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 56 (2017), no. 5, 56:12], the smooth approximation method developed in [Cannarsa, P.; Yu, Y. \textit{Singular dynamics for semiconcave functions}. J. Eur.

Ration. Mech. Anal. 219 (2016), no. 2, 861--885], we prove the existence and stability of such maximal slope curves and discuss certain new weak KAM features. We also prove that maximal slope curves for any pair $(\phi,H)$ are exactly broken characteristics which have right derivatives everywhere.
  Applying this theory, we establish a global variational construction of strict singular characteristics and broken characteristics. Moreover, we prove a result on the global propagation of cut points along generalized characteristics, as well as a result on the propagation of singular points along strict singular characteristics, for weak KAM solutions. We also obtain the continuity equation along strict singular characteristics which clarifies the mass transport nature in the problem of propagation of singularities.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. The shape of the equivalent effective particle is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Extracting Signal out of Chaos: Advancements on MAGI for Bayesian Analysis of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work builds off the manifold-constrained Gaussian process inference (MAGI) method for Bayesian parameter inference and trajectory reconstruction of ODE-based dynamical systems, focusing primarily on sparse and noisy data conditions. First, we introduce Pilot MAGI (pMAGI), a novel methodological upgrade on the base MAGI method that confers significantly-improved numerical stability, parameter inference, and trajectory reconstruction. Second, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, how one can combine MAGI-based methods with dynamical systems theory to provide probabilistic classifications of whether a system is stable or chaotic. Third, we demonstrate how pMAGI performs favorably in many settings against much more computationally-expensive and overparameterized methods. Fourth, we introduce Pilot MAGI Sequential Prediction (PMSP), a novel method building upon pMAGI that allows one to predict the trajectory of ODE-based dynamical systems multiple time steps into the future, given only sparse and noisy observations. We show that PMSP can output accurate future predictions even on chaotic dynamical systems and significantly outperform PINN-based methods. Overall, we contribute to the literature two novel methods, pMAGI and PMSP, that serve as Bayesian, uncertainty-quantified competitors to the Physics-Informed Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Finding Large Independent Sets in Networks Using Competitive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many decision-making algorithms draw inspiration from the inner workings of individual biological systems. However, it remains unclear whether collective behavior among biological species can also lead to solutions for computational tasks. By studying the coexistence of species that interact through simple rules on a network, we demonstrate that the underlying dynamical system can recover near-optimal solutions to the maximum independent set problem -- a fundamental, computationally hard problem in graph theory. Furthermore, we observe that the optimality of these solutions is improved when the competitive pressure in the system is gradually increased. We explain this phenomenon by showing that the cascade of bifurcation points, which occurs with rising competitive pressure in our dynamical system, naturally gives rise to Katz centrality-based node removal in the network. By formalizing this connection, we propose a biologically inspired discrete algorithm for approximating the maximum independent set problem on a graph. Our results indicate that complex systems may collectively possess the capacity to perform non-trivial computations, with implications spanning biology, economics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the pseudospectral approximation of reproduction numbers for age-structured models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously investigate the convergence of a new numerical method, recently proposed by the authors, to approximate the reproduction numbers of a large class of age-structured population models with finite age span. The method consists in reformulating the problem on a space of absolutely continuous functions via an integral mapping. For any chosen splitting into birth and transition processes, we first define an operator that maps a generation to the next one (corresponding to the Next Generation Operator in the case of R0). Then, we approximate the infinite-dimensional operator with a matrix using pseudospectral discretization. In this paper, we prove that the spectral radius of the resulting matrix converges to the true reproduction number, and the (interpolation of the) corresponding eigenvector converges to the associated eigenfunction, with convergence order that depends on the regularity of the model coefficients. Results are confirmed experimentally and applications to epidemiology are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of the Farey tessellation in the hyperbolic plane starts with a finitely generated group of symmetries of an ideal triangle, i.e. a triangle with all vertices on the boundary. It induces a remarkable fractal structure on the boundary of the hyperbolic plane, encoding every element by the continued fraction related to the structure of the tessellation. The problem of finding a generalisation of this construction to the higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces has remained open for many years. In this paper we make the first steps towards a generalisation in the three-dimensional case. We introduce conformal bryophylla, a class of subsets of the boundary of the hyperbolic 3-space which possess fractal properties similar to the Farey tessellation. We classify all conformal bryophylla and study the properties of their limiting sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result of Kaimanovich and Vershik and independently of Rosenblatt that a non-amenable group admits a non-degenerate symmetric measure such that the Poisson boundary is trivial. Most if not all examples to date of non-free actions of countable groups on their Poisson boundaries had the stabilizers sitting inside the amenable radical. We show that every countable non-C*-simple group admits a symmetric measure of full support with non-trivial stabilizers. For a class of non-C*-simple groups with trivial amenable radical, which is non-empty as was shown by le Boudec, this gives a wealth of examples with non-normal stabilizers.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to Hilbert's 16th problem within the framework of global analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem and provide an upper bound on the number of limit cycles that a polynomial, differential, planar system may have, depending exclusively on the degree $n$ of the system. Such a bound turns out to be a polynomial of degree $4$ in $n$. More specifically, if $H(n)$ indicates the maximum number of limit cycles among planar, differential, polynomial systems of degree $n$, then \begin{gather} H(n)\le \dfrac52 n^4-\dfrac{23}2 n^3+ \dfrac{43}2n^2-\dfrac{37}2n+7\,\,\,\, \mbox{if $n$ is even, and} \nonumber
  H(n)\le \dfrac52 n^4-\dfrac{23}2 n^3+ \dfrac{41}2n^2-\dfrac{33}2n+6\,\,\,\, \mbox{if $n$ is odd}.\nonumber \end{gather} For quadratic systems, we find $H(2)=4$. Our proof is entirely variational and utilizes in a fundamental way tools and facts from global analysis to the point that no particular expertise in dynamical systems is necessary or required.</description>

      <title>Horocycle flow on flat projective bundles: topological remarks and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study topological aspects of the dynamics of the foliated horocycle flow on flat projective bundles over hyperbolic surfaces and we derive ergodic consequences. If $\rho : \Gamma \to {\rm PSL}(n+1,\mathbb{R})$ is a representation of a non-elementary Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, the unit tangent bundle $Y$ associated to the flat projective bundle defined by $\rho$ admits a natural action of the affine group $B$ obtained by combining the foliated geodesic and horocycle flows. If the image $\rho(\Gamma)$ satisfies Conze-Guivarc'h conditions, namely strong irreducibility and proximality, the dynamics of the $B$-action is captured by the proximal dynamics of $\rho(\Gamma)$ on $\mathbb{R}{\rm P}^n$ (Theorem A). In fact, the dynamics of the foliated horocycle flow on the unique $B$-minimal subset of $Y$ can be described in terms of dynamics of the horocycle flow on the non-wandering set in the unit tangent bundle $X$ of the surface $S= \Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ (Theorem B). Assuming the existence of a continuous limit map, we prove that the $B$-minimal set is an attractor for the foliated horocycle flow restricted to the proximal part of the non-wandering set in $Y$ (Theorem C). As a corollary, we deduce that the restricted flow admits a unique conservative ergodic $U$-invariant Radon measure (defined up to a multiplicative constant) if and only if $\Gamma$ is convex-cocompact. For example, the foliated horocycle flow on the sphere bundle defined by the Cannon-Thurston map is uniquely ergodic.</description>

Abstract: Borrowing the idea of topological pressure determining measure-theoretical entropy in topological dynamical systems, we establish a variational principle for upper metric mean dimension with potential in terms of upper measure-theoretical metric mean dimension of invariant measures. Moreover, the notion of equilibrium states is introduced to characterize these measures that attain the supremum of the variational principle.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the definition of Li-Yorke chaos for the map f on G-spaces, and show G-Li-Yorke chaos is iterable for f. Li-Yorke chaos implies G-Li-Yorke chaos, while the converse is not true. Then we give a sufficient condition for f to be chaotic in the sense of G-Li-Yorke. Also, we prove that if f is G-transitive and there exists a common fixed point for f and all of the maps in G, then f is chaotic in the sense of G-Li-Yorke.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish strong mixing for the $\mathbb Z^d$-periodic, infinite horizon, Lorentz gas flow for continuous observables with compact support. The essential feature of this natural class of observables is that their support may contain points with infinite free flights. Dealing with such a class of functions is a serious challenge and there is no analogue of it in the finite horizon case. The mixing result for the aforementioned class of functions is obtained via new results: 1) mixing for continuous observables with compact support consisting of configurations at a bounded time from the closest collision; 2) a tightness-type result that allows us to control the configurations with long free flights. To prove 1), we establish a mixing local limit theorem for the Sinai billiard flow with infinite horizon, previously an open question.</description>

Abstract: It was conjectured by Bergelson, Tao, and Ziegler that every Host--Kra ${\mathbf F}_p^\omega$-system of order $k$ is an Abramov system of order $k$. This conjecture has been verified for $k \leq p+1$. In this paper we show that the conjecture fails when $k=5, p=2$. We in fact establish a stronger (combinatorial) statement, in that we produce a bounded function $f: {\mathbf F}_2^n \to {\mathbf C}$ of large Gowers norm $\|f\|_{U^6({\mathbf F}_2^n)}$ which (as per the inverse theorem for that norm) correlates with a non-classical quintic phase polynomial $e(P)$, but with the property that all such phase polynomials $e(P)$ are ``non-measurable'' in the sense that they cannot be well approximated by functions of a bounded number of random translates of $f$.</description>

Abstract: In a money exchange process involving a seller and a buyer, we develop a straightforward model encompassing conservative, non-conservative, and systems with or without debt. Our model integrates the Fermi function to capture the behavior of buyers and sellers. Under certain circumstances, we identify an equation that marks the phase transition between a stable equal wealth state across all connected social graphs and an unstable equal wealth state in some connected social graph.</description>

      <title>Existence of arbitrary large numbers of non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows on hyperbolic $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove that, for every $n\in \mathbb N$, there exists a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ which carries at least $n$ non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows, that are pairwise non-orbitally equivalent. Due to a recent result by Fenley, such Anosov flows are quasi-geodesic. Hence, we get the existence of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds carrying many pairwise non-orbitally equivalent quasi-geodesic Anosov flows. Based on the orbit space theory of Anosov flows developed by Fenley and Barbot, we completely studied the connected components of edge-adjacent lozenges, say, clusters in the orbit spaces of the Anosov flows in construction. The number of the lozenges of a cluster and a type of orientations on the clusters together are used as dynamical invariants to prove that the flows we construct are not orbitally equivalent. We believe that those dynamical invariants could be used in a much wider context.</description>

We prove that every generalized hyperbolic operator on a locally convex space has the finite shadowing property. Contrary to what happens in the Banach space setting, hyperbolic operators on Fr\'echet spaces may fail to have the shadowing property, but we find additional conditions that ensure the validity of the shadowing property. Assuming that the space is sequentially complete, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies the strict periodic shadowing property, but we also show that the hypothesis of sequential completeness is essential. We show that operators with the periodic shadowing property on topological vector spaces have other interesting dynamical behaviors, including the fact that the restriction of such an operator to its chain recurrent set is topologically mixing and Devaney chaotic. We prove that topologically stable operators on locally convex spaces have the finite shadowing property and the strict periodic shadowing property. As a consequence, topologically stable operators on Banach spaces have the shadowing property. Moreover, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies topological stability for operators on Banach spaces. We prove that uniformly topologically expansive operators on locally convex spaces are neither Li-Yorke chaotic nor topologically transitive. Finally, we characterize the notion of topological expansivity for weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Are prime numbers and quadratic residues random?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Appeals to randomness in various number-theoretic constructions appear regularly in modern scientific publications. Such famous names as V.I. Arnold, M. Katz, Yu.G. Sinai, and T. Tao are just a few examples. Unfortunately, all of these approaches rely on various, although often very non-trivial and elegant, heuristics. A new analytical approach is proposed to address the issue of randomness/complexity of an individual deterministic sequence. This approach demonstrates the expected high complexity of quadratic residues and the unexpectedly low complexity in the case of prime numbers. Technically, our approach is based on a new construction of the entropy of a single trajectory of a dynamical system, which occupies an intermediate position between the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Decidability of the isomorphism problem between multidimensional substitutive subshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important question in dynamical systems is the classification problem, i.e., the ability to distinguish between two isomorphic systems. In this work, we study the topological factors between a family of multidimensional substitutive subshifts generated by morphisms with uniform support. We prove that it is decidable to check whether two minimal aperiodic substitutive subshifts are isomorphic. The strategy followed in this work consists of giving a complete description of the factor maps between these subshifts. Then, we deduce some interesting consequences on coalescence, automorphism groups, and the number of aperiodic symbolic factors of substitutive subshifts. We also prove other combinatorial results on these substitutions, such as the decidability of defining a subshift, the computability of the constant of recognizability, and the conjugacy between substitutions with different supports.</description>

      <title>Input gradient annealing neural network for solving low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel yet simple deep learning approach, called input gradient annealing neural network (IGANN), for solving stationary Fokker-Planck equations. Traditional methods, such as finite difference and finite elements, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Neural network based algorithms are meshless methods, which can avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training. We demonstrate that the IGANN method can effectively solve high-dimensional and low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations through our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Koopman Analysis of the Singularly-Perturbed van der Pol Oscillator</title>

Abstract: The Koopman operator framework holds promise for spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems based on linear operators. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, so-called Koopman eigenvalues and Koopman eigenfunctions, respectively, mirror global properties of the system's flow. In this paper we perform the Koopman analysis of the singularly-perturbed van der Pol system. First, we show the spectral signature depending on singular perturbation: how two Koopman {principal} eigenvalues are ordered and what distinct shapes emerge in their associated Koopman eigenfunctions. Second, we discuss the singular limit of the Koopman operator, which is derived through the concatenation of Koopman operators for the fast and slow subsystems. From the spectral properties of the Koopman operator for the {singularly}-perturbed system and the singular limit, we suggest that the Koopman eigenfunctions inherit geometric properties of the singularly-perturbed system. These results are applicable to general planar singularly-perturbed systems with stable limit cycles.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the exponential stability of abstract mean field systems in their synchronized state. We analyze stability by studying the linearized system and demonstrate the existence of an exponentially stable invariant manifold. Our focus is on the equilibrium stability under synchronization. We provide a comprehensive analysis of both linear and nonlinear cases of the system. Additionally, we prove the existence of stable limit cycles and establish a relation between the dynamics in linear and nonlinear frameworks.</description>

      <title>The ideal intersection property for essential groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise, in several complementary ways, \'etale groupoids with locally compact Hausdorff space of units whose essential groupoid C*-algebra has the ideal intersection property, assuming that the groupoid is topologically transitive and either Hausdorff or $\sigma$-compact. This leads directly to a characterisation of the simplicity of this C*-algebra which, for Hausdorff groupoids, agrees with the reduced groupoid C*-algebra. Specifically, we prove for topologically transitive groupoids that the ideal intersection property is equivalent to the absence of essentially confined amenable sections of isotropy groups. For topologically transitive groupoids with compact space of units we moreover show that this is equivalent to the uniqueness of equivariant pseudo-expectations. A key technical idea underlying our results is a new notion of groupoid action on C*-algebras including the essential groupoid C*-algebra itself. For minimal groupoids, we further obtain a relative version of Powers averaging property. Examples arise from suitable group representations into simple groupoid \Cstar-algebras. This is illustrated by the example of the quasi-regular representation of Thompson's group $\mathrm{T}$ with respect to Thompson's group $\mathrm{F}$, which satisfies the relative Powers averaging property in the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies contraction theory with the aim of exploring complete synchronization phenomenon in complex networks of coupled oscillators. We examine the conditions for complete synchronization in three network topologies: all-to-all, star, and ring. Specifically, we derive the conditions under which networks of linearly coupled (Duffing) van der Pol oscillators achieve complete synchronization. Additionally, by combining contraction theory with the trapping region method, we identify the conditions for complete synchronization of networks of linearly coupled Rayleigh van der Pol oscillators under specific initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Solvable Groups and Affine Actions on the Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a structural result for orientation-preserving actions of finitely generated solvable groups on real intervals, considered up to semi-conjugacy. As applications we obtain new answers to a problem first considered by J. F. Plante, which asks under which conditions an action of a solvable group on a real interval is semi-conjugate to an action on the line by affine transformations. We show that this is always the case for actions by $C^1$ diffeomorphisms on closed intervals. For arbitrary actions by homeomorphisms, for which this result is no longer true (as shown by Plante), we show that a semi-conjugacy to an affine action still exists in a local sense, at the level of germs near the endpoints. Finally for a vast class of solvable groups, including all solvable linear groups, we show that the family of affine actions on the line is robust, in the sense that any action by homeomorphisms on the line which is sufficiently close to an affine action must be semi-conjugate to an affine action. This robustness fails for general solvable groups, as illustrated by a counterexample.</description>

      <title>A realisation result for moduli spaces of group actions on the line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03846v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated group $G$, the possible actions of $G$ on the real line (without global fixed points), considered up to semi-conjugacy, can be encoded by the space of orbits of a flow on a compact space $(Y, \Phi)$ naturally associated with $G$ and uniquely defined up to flow equivalence, that we call the \emph{Deroin space} of $G$. We show a realisation result: every expansive flow $(Y, \Phi)$ on a compact metrisable space of topological dimension 1, satisfying some mild additional assumptions, arises as the Deroin space of a finitely generated group. This is proven by identifying the Deroin space of an explicit family of groups acting on suspension flows of subshifts, which is a variant of a construction introduced by the second and fourth authors. This result provides a source of examples of finitely generated groups satisfying various new phenomena for actions on the line, related to their rigidity/flexibility properties and to the structure of (path-)connected components of the space of actions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Time-Average along Uniformly Behaved in ${\mathbb N}$ Sequences on Every Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a uniformly behaved in ${\mathbb N}$ arithmetic sequence ${\bf a}$ and an ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable dynamical system $f$. We consider the time-average of a continuous function $\phi$ along the ${\bf a}$-orbit of $f$ up to $N$. The main result we prove in the paper is that this partial time-average converges for every point in the space if ${\bf a}$ is uniformly behaved in ${\mathbb N}$ and $f$ is minimal and uniquely ergodic and ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable. In addition, if ${\bf a}$ is also completely additive, we then prove that the time-average of a continuous function $\phi$ along the square-free ${\bf a}$-orbit of $f$ up to $N$ converges for every point in the space as well. All equicontinuous dynamical systems are ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable for any sequence ${\bf a}$. When ${\bf a}$ is a subsequence of ${\mathbb N}$ with positive lower density, we give two non-trivial examples of ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable dynamical systems. We give several examples of uniformly behaved in $\mathbb{N}$ sequences, including the counting function of the prime factors in natural numbers, the subsequence of natural numbers indexed by the Thue-Morse (or Rudin-Shapiro) sequence, and the sequence of even (or odd) prime factor natural numbers. We also show that the sequence of square-free natural numbers (or even (or odd) prime factor square-free natural numbers) is rotationally distributed in ${\mathbb N}$ but not uniformly distributed in ${\mathbb Z}$, thus not uniformly behaved in ${\mathbb N}$. We derive other consequences from the main result relevant to number theory and ergodic theory/dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of push-forwards on locally analytic functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for investigating analytic maps from finite discrete data. Our approach is to consider the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals, instead of directly handling the analytic map itself. We establish a methodology enabling appropriate finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward from finite discrete data, through the theory of the Fourier--Borel transform and the Fock space. Moreover, we prove a rigorous convergence result with a convergence rate. As an application, we prove that it is not the least-squares polynomial, but the polynomial obtained by truncating its higher-degree terms, that approximates analytic functions and further allows for approximation beyond the support of the data distribution. One advantage of our theory is that it enables us to apply linear algebraic operations to the finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward. Utilizing this, we prove the convergence of a method for approximating an analytic vector field from finite data of the flow map of an ordinary differential equation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can the system operator learn an incentive mechanism that achieves social optimality based on limited information about the agents' behavior, who are dynamically updating their strategies? To answer this question, we propose an \emph{adaptive} incentive mechanism. This mechanism updates the incentives of agents based on the feedback of each agent's externality, evaluated as the difference between the player's marginal cost and society's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the agents' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by agents to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence of the adaptive incentive mechanism to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant games: atomic networked quadratic aggregative games and non-atomic network routing games.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isospectral set of the Dirac matrix D=d+d* consists of orthogonal Q for which Q* D Q is an equivalent Dirac matrix. It can serve as the symmetry of a finite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary group and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt D=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the Toda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.</description>
