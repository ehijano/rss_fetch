      <title>Unraveling the Allosteric Mechanism and Mechanical Stability of Partial and Complete Loss-of-Function Mutations in p53 DNA-Binding Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers, with mutations primarily in its DNA-binding domain (p53-DBD). Mutations in p53-DBD are categorized into hotspot mutations (resulting in complete loss-of-function) and non-hotspot mutations (inducing partial loss-of-function). However, the allosteric mechanisms underlying non-hotspot mutations remain elusive. Using p53 dimer as models, we constructed p53-WT, non-hotspot p53-E180R, and hotspot p53-R248W dimer-DNA complexes to compare the structural and functional impacts of these two mutation types. Our results reveal that both mutations weaken intramolecular interactions in p53-DBD and enhance structural flexibility. Specifically, E180R perturbs dimer interface interactions, impairing dimer stability and cooperative DNA binding; R248W disrupts interactions between the L3/L1 loops and DNA, leading to the loss of DNA-binding capacity. Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations further confirm that both mutations accelerate p53 dimer dissociation, with E180R exerting the most prominent disruptive effect on the mechanical stability of the dimer interface.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Real-Time Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins with Arrays of Biofunctionalized Graphene Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing interest in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) for biosensing applications, there is a strong demand for strategies enabling flexible and multiplexed biofunctionalization, as well as highly parallel, real-time electronic readout integrated with microfluidic control. Here we present a methodology that addresses these challenges by enabling real-time, parallel monitoring of multiple GFETs integrated on a single microfabricated chip within an automated electronic and microfluidic platform. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach through ultrasensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. GFET chips are functionalized via van der Waals assembly using 1 nm-thick molecular two-dimensional (2D) materials - carbon nanomembranes - which enable multiplexed biofunctionalization. The chips are integrated into a custom-developed microelectronic and microfluidic system that allows parallel, real-time, and automated measurements of 15 GFETs. We present in situ biofunctionalization of the GFETs with antibodies, followed by highly specific detection of the S- and N-proteins with limits of detection down to 10 aM and a dynamic range spanning four orders of magnitude. Owing to its versatility, the presented methodology is readily adaptable for sensing a wide range of biological and chemical targets.</description>

      <title>MERGE-RNA: a physics-based model to predict RNA secondary structure ensembles with chemical probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The function of RNA molecules is deeply related to their secondary structure, which determines which nucleobases are accessible for pairing. Most RNA molecules however function through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. Chemical probing methods (e.g., DMS probing) rely on selective chemical modification of accessible RNA nucleotides to infer base-pairing status, yet the resulting nucleotide-resolution data represent ensemble averages over dynamic RNA conformations. We present MERGE-RNA, a unified, physics-based framework that explicitly models the full experimental pipeline, from the thermodynamics of probe binding to the mutational profiling readout. By integrating measurements across probe concentrations and replicates, our model learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters together with minimal sequence-specific soft constraints. This enables the prediction of secondary structure ensembles that best explain the data and the detection of suboptmal structures involved in dynamic processes. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy while preserving essential conformational heterogeneity. In a designed RNA for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA detects transient intermediate states associated with strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium geometric forces steer spiral waves on folded surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral waves are ubiquitous signatures of non equilibrium dynamics, appearing across chemical, biological, and active systems. Yet, in many living systems these waves unfold on curved and folded surfaces whose geometry has rarely been treated as a dynamical factor. Here we show that surface curvature fundamentally shapes spiral wave behavior and can contribute to the organization of neural activity in the brain. Via analytical theory and simulations of the complex Ginzburg Landau equation (CGLE) on curved surfaces, we demonstrate that curvature enters through the Laplace Beltrami operator as a spatial modulation of effective diffusion. Gradients of this effective diffusion generate a geometric force on spiral defects, and the complex nature of the CGLE produces a complex mobility that leads to non central and non reciprocal responses. Applied to realistic cortical surfaces of the human brain, the model predicts that the pattern of cortical folding stabilizes and localizes spiral waves, while progressive smoothing of the surface erases these non equilibrium structures. This reveals that brain geometry is not a passive scaffold but an active physical constraint that shapes neural dynamics. More broadly, the same geometric mechanism provides a universal route by which curvature and topology control pattern formation across oscillatory, chemical, and active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Principles of Client Enrichment in Multicomponent Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are commonly organized by a small number of scaffold molecules that drive phase separation together with client molecules that do not condense on their own but become selectively recruited into the dense phase. A central open question is how client recruitment feeds back on scaffold interactions to determine condensate composition. Here we address this problem in a reconstituted focal adhesion system composed of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated p130Cas (Cas) as scaffolds and the adaptor protein paxillin (PXN) as a client. We show that both FAK phosphorylation and PXN recruitment produce a common compositional response in which FAK becomes enriched while Cas is depleted within the condensate. To interpret these observations, we develop two complementary theoretical descriptions. First, within a two-component Flory-Huggins framework, we show that phosphorylation can be captured by either strengthening heterotypic FAK-Cas interactions or increasing the effective number of interaction-relevant segments on FAK, both of which bias partitioning toward FAK-rich condensates. Second, we introduce a minimal three-component Flory-Huggins theory without an explicit solvent and map it onto an effective two-component description, demonstrating that client recruitment renormalizes homotypic and heterotypic scaffold interactions. Analytical predictions for the location of the critical point are tested in reconstituted multicomponent systems through PXN addition, showing that client recruitment alone tunes proximity to criticality and reshapes condensate composition. Together, our results reveal distinct yet convergent physical routes by which post-translational modification and client recruitment control scaffold composition in multicomponent condensates.</description>
