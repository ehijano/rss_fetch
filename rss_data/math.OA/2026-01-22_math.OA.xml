      <title>Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Pricing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra and let $(N_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ be an increasing family of abelian von Neumann subalgebras encoding a (classical) information flow. Fix a faithful normal state $\varphi_\rho$ on $M$ and assume a filtration of normal $\varphi_\rho$-preserving conditional expectations $E_t:M\to N_t$ satisfying the tower property. For self-adjoint observables affiliated with $M$, we introduce a truncation-stable notion of $(N_t,E_t)$-martingales via bounded functional-calculus cutoffs $f_n$, and formulate a \emph{Local Informational Efficiency Principle} requiring symmetrically discounted traded prices to be martingales in this localized sense.
  Assuming the existence of a pricing state $\varphi^\star$ and a compatible family of normal $\varphi^\star$-preserving conditional expectations $(E_t^\star)$, we define for bounded terminal payoffs $X\in M_T$ the dynamic pricing operator \[ \Pi_t(X):=B_t^{1/2}\,E_t^\star\!\bigl(B_T^{-1/2}XB_T^{-1/2}\bigr)\,B_t^{1/2}, \] where $(B_t)$ is a strictly positive num\'eraire adapted to $(N_t)$. We prove that $(\Pi_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ is normal, completely positive, unital, $N_t$-bimodular, and time-consistent; in the commutative reduction it coincides with classical risk-neutral valuation by conditional expectation.
  We further develop an $L^2(M,\varphi_\rho)$-prediction theory: $E_t$ acts as the $L^2$-optimal predictor and yields a canonical innovation decomposition. For differentiable parametric families of normal states, we introduce an operator-valued Fisher information relative to $(N_t)$ and derive a noncommutative Cram\'er--Rao inequality giving a quantitative lower bound on conditional mean-square prediction error under information constraints; the bound is computed explicitly for compound Poisson lattice-jump models under the risk-neutral constraint $\sum_{\alpha}\gamma_\alpha(e^{\alpha\Delta x}-1)=r$.</description>

      <title>Order isomorphisms in $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete description of the order isomorphisms between the self-adjoint parts of $C^*$-algebras. Furthermore, we characterize such isomorphisms between general operator intervals in $AW^*$-algebras. For the description, we use Jordan $^*$-isomorphisms and closed operators in the regular rings of $AW^{*}$-algebras. This work generalizes previous results on von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Banach algebra crossed products by inverse semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained and simplified presentation of the theory of covariant representations for inverse semigroup actions on Banach algebras, which was recently introduced in the authors and A. Mckee in the twisted case. The main result of this note is a general universal description of the associated Banach algebra crossed product, that allows disintegration of all representations of the crossed product. Such a disintegration was studied so far only for actions on spaces.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study embeddings of $L^p$-operator algebras arising from (twisted) \'etale groupoids, with particular emphasis on rigidity phenomena for $p\neq 2$. Our methods rely on a detailed analysis of core normalizers and their functorial behavior under algebra homomorphisms. Using the notion of actors between groupoids, we show that under natural hypotheses, embeddings between reduced $L^p$-groupoid algebras can be described entirely in terms of morphisms of the underlying groupoids. We further show that embeddings of $L^p$-groupoid algebras induce embeddings of the associated topological full groups. Our results provide new tools for studying embeddability questions in the $L^p$-setting, and are particularly helpful when ruling out the existence of embeddings.
  As applications, we obtain strong rigidity results for (spatial) $L^p$-AF-embeddability, showing that, for $p\neq 2$, an $L^p$-groupoid algebra embeds into a spatial $L^p$-AF-algebra if and only if the underlying groupoid is AF. In particular, irrational rotation $L^p$-operator algebras do not embed into spatial $L^p$-AF-algebras. We apply these results to tensor products of $L^p$-Cuntz algebras and prove that, for $p\neq 2$, there is no unital contractive homomorphism from $\mathcal{O}_2^p \otimes_p \mathcal{O}_2^p$ into $\mathcal{O}_2^p$, showing that there is no $L^p$-analog of Kirchberg's $\mathcal{O}_2$-embedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Bigraph independence : a mixture of the five natural independences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of non-commutative joint independence for multiple algebras in a non-commutative probability space. The pairwise relationships between these algebras are encoded by a graph with two edge sets -- a combinatorial structure we call a bigraph -- and naturally encompass the five fundamental types of independence: tensor, free, (anti)monotone, and Boolean. It subsumes the BMT independence of Arizmendi--Mendoza--Vazquez-Becerra (when all pairwise relationships are Boolean, (anti)monotone, or tensor) and the $\epsilon$ or $\Lambda$-independence of Mlotkowski (when the pairwise relationships are tensor and free). We present explicit combinatorial moment formulas, a Hilbert space construction, and natural associativity relations within this setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bigraph independence emerges in the asymptotic behavior of tensor product random matrix models with respect to a vector state, encompassing the Charlesworth--Collins model for $\varepsilon$-independence as a special case and offering a random matrix perspective on BMT independence.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Transitivity Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we promote an infinite Kadison transitivity theorem on massive $C^*$-algebras, including the Calkin algebra. This transitivity stems from the analog of countable degree-1 saturation on pure states which is inherited from these algebras via excision. We show this saturation to be equivalent to several order-theoretic properties on the quantum filter associated to the state, in particular the property of being a quantum P-point. While we show their existence is independent from ZFC, under basic set theoretic assumptions, we produce a plethora of these states. Finally, we find an irreducible representation of the Calkin algebra which fails infinite transitivity.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Minkowski integral inequality and a unitary categorification criterion for fusion rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a noncommutative analogue of Minkowski's integral inequality for commuting squares of tracial von Neumann algebras. The inequality implies a necessary condition for a quadruple of graphs to be realized as inclusion graphs of a commuting square of multi-matrix algebras. As a corollary, we obtain a unitary categorification criterion for based rings, in particular, fusion rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.08237v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $C^*$-algebra $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$ of a smooth 4-dimensional manifold $\mathscr{M}$ introduced by G\'abor Etesi. It is proved that the $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$ is a stationary AF-algebra. We calculate the topological and smooth invariants of $\mathscr{M}$ in terms of the K-theory of the $C^*$-algebra $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$. Using Gompf's Stable Diffeomorphism Theorem, it is shown that all smoothings of $\mathscr{M}$ form a torsion abelian group. The latter is isomorphic to the Brauer group of a number field associated to the K-theory of $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$.</description>

      <title>Banach algebras associated to twisted \'{e}tale groupoids: simplicity and pure infiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define reduced and essential Banach algebras associated to a twisted \'{e}tale (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and extend some fundamental results from $C^*$-algebras to this context. We prove that for topologically free groupoids the associated essential Banach algebras have the ideal interesection property, and thus such an algebra is simple if and only if the groupoid is minimal. We give conditions under which reduced algebras are essential (for example Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$ is sufficient). This in particular solves the simplicity problem posed recently by Gardella-Lupini for $L^p$-operator algebras associated to $\mathcal{G}$. In addition, using either the $n$-filling or locally contracting condition we give pure infiniteness criteria for essential simple Banach algebras associated to $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$. This extends the corresponding $C^*$-algebraic results that were previously known to hold in the untwisted Hausdorff case. The results work nicely, and allow for characterisation of the generalized intersection property, in the realm of $L^P$-operator algebras where $P \subseteq [1,\infty]$ is a non-empty set of parameters. Such algebras cover in particular $L^p$-operator algebras, for $p\in [1,\infty]$, and their Banach $*$-algebra versions.
  We apply our results to Banach algebra crossed products by twisted partial group actions, Roe-type Banach algebras with coefficients in finite-rank operators on a Banach space, twisted tight $L^P$-operator algebras of inverse semigroups, graph $L^P$-operator algebras, and algebras associated to self-similar group actions on graphs. We also interpret our results in terms of twisted inverse semigroup actions and their crossed products.</description>
