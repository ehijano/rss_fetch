      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-$q$-traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui23].
  We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from Segal's sewing. Therefore, our result on the convergence of Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16].
  Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Complex Structures for the Full Quantum Flag Manifold of Quantum SU(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Lusztig's positive root vectors (with respect to a distinguished choice of reduced decomposition of the longest element of the Weyl group) were shown to give a quantum tangent space for every $A$-series Drinfeld--Jimbo full quantum flag manifold $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{F}_n)$. Moreover, the associated differential calculus $\Omega^{(0,\bullet)}_q(\mathrm{F}_n)$ was shown to have classical dimension, giving a direct $q$-deformation of the classical anti-holomorphic Dolbeault complex of $\mathrm{F}_n$. Here we examine in detail the rank two case, namely the full quantum flag manifold of $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{SU}_3)$. In particular, we examine the $*$-differential calculus associated to $\Omega^{(0,\bullet)}_q(\mathrm{F}_3)$ and its non-commutative complex geometry. We find that the number of almost-complex structures reduces from $8$ (that is $2$ to the power of the number of positive roots of $\frak{sl}_3$) to $4$ (that is $2$ to the power of the number of simple roots of $\frak{sl}_3$). Moreover, we show that each of these almost-complex structures is integrable, which is to say, each of them is a complex structure. Finally, we observe that, due to non-centrality of all the non-degenerate coinvariant $2$-forms, none of these complex structures admits a left $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{SU}_3)$-covariant noncommutative K\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Modularity of Vertex Operator Algebra Correlators with Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known from Zhu's results that under modular transformations, correlators of rational $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras transform like Jacobi forms.
  We investigate the modular transformation properties of VOA correlators that have zero modes inserted. We derive recursion relations for such correlators and use them to establish modular transformation properties. We find that correlators with only zero modes transform like quasi-modular forms, and mixed correlators with both zero modes and vertex operators transform like quasi-Jacobi forms. As an application of our results, we introduce algebras of higher weight fields whose zero mode correlators mimic the properties of those of weight 1 fields. We also give a simplified proof of the weight 1 transformation properties originally proven by Miyamoto.</description>

      <title>Affirmative answer to the Question of Leroy and Matczuk on injectivity of endomorphisms of semiprime left Noetherian rings with large images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The class of semiprime left Goldie rings is a huge class of rings that contains many large subclasses of rings -- semiprime left Noetherian rings, semiprime rings with Krull dimension, rings of differential operators on affine algebraic varieties and universal enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie algebras to name a few. In the paper, `Ring endomorphisms with large images,' {\em Glasg. Math. J.} {\bf 55} (2013), no. 2, 381--390, A. Leroy and J. Matczuk posed the following question:
  {\em If a ring endomorphism of a semiprime left Noetherian ring has a large image, must it be injective?}
  The aim of the paper is to give an affirmative answer to the Question of Leroy and Matczuk and to prove the following more general results.
  {\bf Theorem. (Dichotomy)} {\em Each endomorphism of a semiprime left Goldie ring with large image is either a monomorphism or otherwise its kernel contains a regular element of the ring ($\Leftrightarrow$ its kernel is an essential left ideal of the ring). In general, both cases are non-empty.}
  {\bf Theorem. } {\em Every endomorphism with large image of a semiprime ring with Krull dimension is a monomorphism.}
  {\bf Theorem. (Positive answer to the Question of Leroy and Matczuk)} {\em Every endomorphism with large image of a semiprime left Noetherian ring is a monomorphism.}</description>

      <title>Levi-Civita connection on the irreducible quantum flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify covariant metrics (in the sense of Beggs and Majid) on a class of quantum homogeneous spaces. In particular, our classification implies the existence of a unique (up to scalar) quantum symmetric covariant metric on the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi for the quantized irreducible flag manifolds. Moreover, we prove the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection for any real covariant metric for the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi. This generalizes Matassa's result for the quantum projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Bow varieties: Stable envelopes and their 3d mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the elliptic characteristic classes known as ''stable envelopes'', which were introduced by M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove that for a rich class of holomorphic symplectic varieties$\unicode{x2013}$called Cherkis bow varieties$\unicode{x2013}$their elliptic stable envelopes exhibit a duality property inspired by mirror symmetry in $d=3$, $\mathcal N=4$ quantum field theories. A crucial step of our proof involves the process of ''resolving'' large charge branes into multiple smaller charge branes. This phenomenon turns out to be the geometric counterpart of the algebraic fusion procedure. Along the way we discover various new features in the geometry of bow varieties.</description>
