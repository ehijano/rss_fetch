      <title>Orbital Wigner functions and quantum transport in multiband systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional theories of electron transport in crystals are based on the Boltzmann equation and do not capture physics arising from quantum coherence. We introduce a transport formalism based on ''orbital Wigner functions'', which accurately captures quantum coherent physics in multiband fermionic systems. We illustrate the power of this approach compared to traditional semiclassical transport theory by testing it numerically against microscopic simulations of one-dimensional, non-interacting, two-band systems -- the simplest systems capable of exhibiting inter-orbital coherence. We show that orbital Wigner functions accurately capture strongly non-equilibrium features of electron dynamics that lie beyond conventional Boltzmann theory, such as the ballistic transport of a relative phase between microscopic orbitals and topological Thouless pumping of charge both at non-zero temperature and away from the adiabatic limit. Our approach is motivated in part by modern ultracold atom experiments that can prepare and measure far-from-equilibrium charge transport and phase coherence in multiband fermionic systems, calling for correspondingly precise theories of transport. The quantitative accuracy exhibited by our approach, together with its capacity to capture nontrivial physics even at the ballistic scale, establishes orbital Wigner functions as an ideal starting point for developing a fully systematic theory of transport in crystals.</description>

      <title>Localization versus incommemsurability for finite boson system in one-dimensional disordered lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effect of disorder on a few-boson system in a finite one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential covering the full interaction ranging from uncorrelated to strongly correlated particles. We apply numerically exact multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons to obtain the few-body emergent states in a finite lattice for both commensurate and incommensurate filling factors. The detailed characterization is done by the measures of one- and two-body correlations, fragmentation, order parameter. For commensurate filling, we trace the conventional fingerprints of disorder induced localization in the weakly interacting limit, however we observe robustness of fragmented and strongly correlated Mott in the disordered lattice. For filling factor smaller than one, we observe existing delocalization fraction of particles interplay in a complex way. For strongly interacting limit, the introduced disorder drags the fragmented superfluid of primary lattice to Mott localization. For filling factor larger than one in the primary lattice, the extra delocalization always resides on commensurate background of Mott-insulator. We observe beyond Bose-Hubbard physics in the fermionization limit when the pairing bosons fragment into two orbitals -- Mott dimerization happens. The introduced disorder first relocates the dimers, then strong disorder starts to interfere with the background Mott correlation. These findings unlock a rich landscape of unexplored localization process in the quasiperiodic potentials and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum many-body states with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition through tunable nearest-neighbor interactions in a one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional model of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions with tunable nearest-neighbor interactions. By introducing alternating repulsive and attractive interactions on consecutive bonds, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a bond-ordered (BO) phase to a charge-density wave-II (CDW-II) phase as the attractive interaction strength increases at a fixed repulsive interaction. For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish. We identify these phases using a combination of order parameters, topological invariants, edge-state analysis and Thouless charge pumping. By extending our analysis beyond half-filling, we explore the phase diagram across all densities and identify the superfluid (SF) and the pair-superfluid (PSF) phases, characterized by single-particle and bound-pair excitations at incommensurate densities. The proposed model is experimentally realizable in platforms such as Rydberg excited or ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offering a versatile framework to study such interplay between topology and interactions in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Periodic Density Patterns in Driven Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of collective excitations is a crucial tool for understanding many-body quantum systems. For instance, they play a central role in the exploration of superfluidity and other quantum macroscopic phenomena in Bose and Fermi systems. In this work we present a variational and a numerical study of a parametrically driven Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical harmonic trap in which the aspect ratio can be varied from a prolate (cigar-shaped) to an oblate (pancake-shaped) system. The excitation can be applied by periodically modulating the harmonic frequencies of the trap or, alternatively, the interatomic interaction strength at a frequency that matches that of the system breathing mode. As a result, we observe the formation of dynamical density patterns that depend on the geometry of the trap: a fringe pattern in a prolate system and a ring pattern in an oblate one. By decomposing the total energy into its kinetic, potential, and interaction terms, we show that the onset of these patterns coincides with the redistribution of kinetic energy along the weakly trapped directions of the sample, indicating the three-dimensional nature of the studied phenomena. Finally, our analysis shows that the difference between the two excitation mechanisms lies on the system stability. Modulating the trap destabilizes the system quicker than modulating the interactions, leading to earlier formation of the patterns.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. This is done with a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free-fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Excitations of a supersolid annular stripe phase in a spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the collective excitations of the supersolid annular stripe phase of a spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled (SOAM-coupled) spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The annular stripe phase simultaneously breaks two continuous symmetries, namely rotational and $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and is more probable in the condensates with a larger orbital angular momentum transfer imparted by a pair of Laguerre-Gaussian beams than what has been considered in the recent experiments. Accordingly, we consider a SOAM-coupled spin-1 condensate with a $4\hbar$ orbital angular momentum transferred by the lasers. Depending on the values of the Raman coupling strength and quadratic Zeeman term, the condensate with realistic antiferromagnetic interactions supports three ground-state phases: the annular stripe, the vortex necklace, and the zero angular momentum phase. We numerically calculate the collective excitations of the condensate as a function of coupling and quadratic Zeeman field strengths for a fixed ratio of spin-dependent and spin-independent interaction strengths. At low Raman coupling strengths, we observe a direct transition from the zero angular momentum to the annular stripe phase, characterized by the softening of a double symmetric roton mode, which serves as a precursor to supersolidity.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Tractable Generation of High-Order Rogue Waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a prototypical, experimentally accessible scenario that enables the systematic generation of so-called high-order rogue waves in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. These waveforms lead to significantly and controllably more extreme focusing events than the famous Peregrine soliton. In one spatial dimension, we showcase conclusive numerical evidence that our scheme generates the focusing behavior associated with the first four rogue waves from the relevant hierarchy. We then extend considerations to anisotropic two-dimensional and even three-dimensional settings, establishing that the scheme can generate second order rogue waves despite the well-known limitation of finite-time blow up of focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</description>
