      <title>Does one still need to "shut up and calculate"?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In learning quantum mechanics, an essential question has always been: How does one go about developing a "physical feel" for quantum phenomena? Naturally, one needs a basis or ground zero to start from, and that basis must be unlike anything with which we are already familiar in consequence of our experiences with the world of classical physics. We argue (channeling Richard Feynman) that the most elementary and the least cumbersome concept to build upon is the existence of complex probability amplitudes for physical events. An event that can take place in multiple alternative ways should be treated by adding the corresponding amplitudes when the paths are, in principle, indistinguishable, and by adding the probabilities themselves when the paths are distinguishable. Once we accept this principle and hone our intuition by examining quantum phenomena in its light, we will be on the path to "understanding" quantum mechanics. Elementary examples from the field of quantum optics demonstrate how adherence to Feynman's principle could lead to a better, more "intuitive" appreciation for the magic of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Quantum Subspace Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated beyond the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Current experimental upper bounds on spacetime diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistent theory describing the dynamics of quantum systems interacting on a classical space-time was recently put forward by Oppenheim et al..[1, 2]. Quantum states may retain their coherence, at the cost of some amount of stochasticity of the spacetime metric, characterized by a spacetime diffusion parameter. Here, we report existing experimental upper bounds on such space-time diffusion, based on a review of several types of experiments with very low force noise over a broad range of test masses from single atoms to several kilograms. We find an upper bound at least 15 orders of magnitude lower as compared to the initial bounds for explicit models presented by Oppenheimn et al. The results presented here provide a path forward for future experiments that can help evaluate classical-quantum theories</description>

      <title>Error analysis in large area multi-Raman pulse atom interferometry due to undesired spontaneous decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the fact that atom interferometry has been a successful application of quantum sensing, a major topic of interest is the further improvement of the sensitivity of these devices. In particular, the area enclosed by the interferometer (which controls the sensitivity) can be increased by providing a larger momentum kick to the atom cloud, increasing the extent of the momentum axis. One such atom optics technique involves increasing the number of central $\pi-$Raman pulses. This technique, while providing the prerequisite additional momentum boost, also causes the atom to remain in the intermediate high energy state for longer periods of time. This additional length of time is often neglected in many treatments due to the adiabatic elimination of the higher energy state enabled by the large optical detuning. The increased time in the intermediate high energy state results in a higher probability of undesired spontaneous decay and a loss of quantum information, thereby adding error to the atom interferometer. In this work, we consider an open quantum system using the Lindblad master equation to devise a model for the atomic state dynamics that includes the undesired spontaneous decay from the intermediate high energy state. We formulate an error figure of merit to analyze limitations of an atom interferometer configured for acceleration measurements. Our theoretical results show the error figure of merit will be dominated by a $N_{R}^{-2}$ scaling factor for low numbers of $\pi-$Raman pulses, but will be dominated by a monotonic increase in error for high number of $\pi-$Raman pulses. We determined the number of $\pi$-Raman pulses that accomplishes maximal momentum transfer with a the minimal error, depending on major system parameters.</description>

      <title>Multi-product Hamiltonian simulation with explicit commutator scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-conditioned multi-product formula (MPF), proposed by [Low, Kliuchnikov, and Wiebe, 2019], is a simple high-order time-independent Hamiltonian simulation algorithm that implements a linear combination of standard product formulas of low order. While the MPF aims to simultaneously exploit commutator scaling among Hamiltonians and achieve near-optimal time and precision dependence, its lack of a rigorous error bound on the nested commutators renders its practical advantage ambiguous. In this work, we conduct a rigorous complexity analysis of the well-conditioned MPF, demonstrating explicit commutator scaling and near-optimal time and precision dependence at the same time. Using our improved complexity analysis, we present several applications of practical interest where the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve a polynomial speedup in both system size and evolution time, as well as an exponential speedup in precision, compared to second-order and even higher-order product formulas. Compared to post-Trotter methods, the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve polynomially better scaling in system size, with only poly-logarithmic overhead in evolution time and precision.</description>

      <title>Security Assumptions in Dispersive-Optics QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) seeks to provide a method of generating cryptographically-secure keys between remote parties while guaranteeing unconditional security. Implementations of high-dimensional QKD using dispersive-optics (DO-QKD) have been proposed to allow for multiple secure bits to be transmitted per photon while remaining cost-effective and scalable using existing telecommunication technology [1]. In the recent literature, there have been a number of experimental realizations of DO-QKD systems [2-6], with security analysis based on the treatment in Ref. [1]. Here we demonstrate that in the case of finite dispersion, the model assumed for the eavesdropper's attack in Ref. [1] is non-optimal for the eavesdropper, which leads to a significant overestimation of the secure key rate between parties. We consider an alternative attack model that Alice and Bob find indistinguishable from the Ref. [1] model, as long as they are restricted to making the measurements typical in DO-QKD. We provide concrete examples where a significant gap exists between the Holevo information, and therefore the secret key rate, predicted by the two models. We further analyze the experiment in Ref. [2] as an example of a case where secure key is predicted according to the Ref. [1] model, but where in fact there is zero secure key rate when considering the full set of collective attacks that an eavesdropper may perform.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent entanglement advantage in spin-network Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performance of an Ising spin network for quantum reservoir computing (QRC) in linear and non-linear memory tasks. We investigate the extent to which quantumness enhances performance by monitoring the behaviour of quantum entanglement, which we quantify by means of the partial transpose of the density matrix. In the most general case where the effects of dissipation are incorporated, our results indicate that the strength of the entanglement advantage depends on the frequency of the input signal; the benefit of entanglement is greater the more rapidly fluctuating the signal, whereas a low-frequency input lends itself better to a non-entangled reservoir. This suggests that the extent to which quantumness is beneficial is dependent on the difficulty of the memory task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we defined twisted unitary $1$-groups and showed that they automatically induced error-detecting quantum codes. We also showed that twisted unitary $1$-groups correspond to irreducible products of characters thereby reducing the problem of code-finding to a computation in the character theory of finite groups. Using a combination of GAP computations and results from the mathematics literature on irreducible products of characters, we identify many new non-trivial quantum codes with unusual transversal gates.</description>

      <title>Casimir repulsion with biased semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum and thermal fluctuations are fundamental to a plethora of phenomena within quantum optics, including the Casimir effect that acts between closely separated surfaces typically found in MEMS and NEMS devices. Particularly promising for engineering and harnessing these forces are systems out of thermal equilibrium. Recently, semiconductors with external bias have been proposed to study the nonequilibrium Casimir force. Here, we explore systems involving moderately biased semiconductors that exhibit strong repulsive Casimir forces, and we determine the effects of bias voltage, semiconductor bandgap energy, and separation for experimentally accessible configurations. Modes emitted from the semiconductors exert a repulsive force on a near surface that overcomes the attractive equilibrium Casimir force contribution at submicron distances. For the geometry of two parallel planes, those modes undergo Fabry-P\'erot interference resulting in an oscillatory force behavior as a function of separation. Utilizing the proximity-force approximation, we predict that the repulsive force exerted on a gold sphere is well within the accuracy of typical Casimir force experiments. Our work opens up new possibilities of controlling forces at the nano- and micrometer scale with applications in sensing and actuation in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-time Traffic Control using QUBO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion is one of the major issues in urban areas, particularly when traffic loads exceed the roads capacity, resulting in higher petrol consumption and carbon emissions as well as delays and stress for road users. In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real Dongda-Keyuan intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.</description>

      <title>Adaptivity is not helpful for Pauli channel learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note shows that adaptive strategies do not offer additional advantages for learning and testing Pauli channels with entangled input. First, the tight query complexity of learning Pauli channels with entangled input is established for the general norm $l_p$. In particular, the complexities for the $l_{1}$, $l_2$ and $l_\infty$ norms are improved or matched compared to previous results using entanglement in the literature. We also settle the query complexity to test if Pauli channels are white noise sources across $l_p$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the query complexity of estimating the noise level of a Pauli channel, characterized by the entropy of its error distribution and the count of non-zero probabilities, is $\Theta(4^n/n)$. Further, $\Theta(4^n/n)$ queries are sufficient to estimate the diamond norm between two Pauli channels.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hilbert-Space Fragmentation on a Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several counterexamples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we experimentally explore initial-state dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we observe distinct non-equilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain wall numbers. This distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Energy-gap modulation and majorization in three-level quantum Otto engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-level quantum system having two energy gaps presents a nontrivial working medium for a quantum heat engine. Our focus lies in understanding the constraints on the ability to modulate these gaps relative to the changes in probability distributions at the two given heat reservoirs. It is seen that an Otto engine in the quasistatic limit is feasible if at least one energy gap shrinks during the first quantum adiabatic stage. We analyze operating conditions under different variations of the gaps, revealing that a definite majorization relation between the hot and cold distributions serves as a sufficient criterion for the engine when both gaps are shrinking. Further, Otto efficiency is enhanced in case majorization holds. On the other hand, majorization becomes a necessary condition when only one of the gaps is shrinking. In the special case where one gap remains fixed, majorization is both necessary and sufficient for engine operation. For an $n$-level system, we note that a well defined change in energy gaps aligns with the majorization relation, thus characterizing the operation of the engine.</description>

      <title>Verification of Bell Nonlocality by Violating Quantum Monogamy Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality as a witness of entanglement plays a crucial role in various fields. Existing quantum monogamy relations rule out the possibility of simultaneous violations of any Bell inequalities with partial statistics generated from one Bell experiment on any multipartite entanglement or post-quantum sources. In this paper, we report an efficient method to construct multipartite Bell test based on any Bell inequalities. We demonstrate that violating these monogamy relations can dynamically witness simultaneous Bell nonlocalities of partial systems. We conduct a tripartite experiment to verify quantum nonlocalities by violating a tripartite monogamy relation using a maximally entangled two-photon state.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Differential Privacy: A Survey on Quantum Computing Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has attracted significant attention in areas such as cryptography, cybersecurity, and drug discovery. Due to the advantage of parallel processing, quantum computing can speed up the response to complex challenges and the processing of large-scale datasets. However, since quantum computing usually requires sensitive datasets, privacy breaches have become a vital concern. Differential privacy (DP) is a promising privacy-preserving method in classical computing and has been extended to the quantum domain in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the existing literature based on whether internal inherent noise or external artificial noise is used as a source to achieve DP in quantum computing. We explore how these approaches are applied at different stages of a quantum algorithm (i.e., state preparation, quantum circuit, and quantum measurement). We also discuss challenges and future directions for DP in quantum computing. By summarizing recent advancements, we hope to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date overview for researchers venturing into this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum extension of dynamic programming, a fundamental computational method for efficiently solving recursive problems using memory. Our innovation lies in showing how to coherently generate unitaries of recursion steps using memorized intermediate quantum states. We find that quantum dynamic programming yields an exponential reduction in circuit depth for a large class of fixed-point quantum recursions, including a known recursive variant of the Grover's search. Additionally, we apply quantum dynamic programming to a recently proposed double-bracket quantum algorithm for diagonalization to obtain a new protocol for obliviously preparing a quantum state in its Schmidt basis, providing a potential pathway for revealing entanglement structures of unknown quantum states.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of universal contextuality through communication games free of both operational inequivalence and compatibility loopholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal contextuality is the leading notion of non-classicality even for single systems, showing its advantage as a more general quantum correlation than Bell non-locality, as well as preparation contextuality. However, a loophole-free experimental demonstration of universal contextuality at least requires that both operational inequivalence and compatibility loopholes are closed, which have never been simultaneously achieved to date. In our work, we experimentally test universal contextuality through (3,3) and (4,3) communication games, simultaneously restoring operational equivalence and circumventing the compatibility loophole. Our result exhibits the violation of universal non-contextuality bound by 97 standard deviations in (3,3) scenario, and 107 deviations in (4,3) scenario. Notably there are states which exhibit locality but reveal universal contextuality in both two scenarios. In addition, our result shows that universal contextuality is more general than preparation contextuality in (3,3) scenario, while equivalent to preparation contextuality in (4,3) scenario.</description>

      <title>A new approach towards quantum foundation and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general theory based upon 6 postulates is introduced. The basical notions are theoretical variables that are associated with an observer or with a group of communicating observers. These variables may be accessible or inaccessible. From these postulates, the ordinary formalism of quantum theory are derived. The mathematical derivations are not given in this article, but I refer to the recent articles [9, 10]. Three possible applications of the general theory can be given; 1) The variables may decision variables connected to the decisions of a person or of a group of persons. 2) The variables may be statistical parameters or future data, But most importantly here: 3) The variables are physical variables in some context. This last application gives a completely new foundation of quantum mechanics, a foundation which in my opinion is much more easy to understand than the ordinary formalism.The other applications seem also to give interesting consequences of the approach. Socalled paradoxes like that of Schr\"odinger's cat can be clarified under the theory. Explanations of the outcomes of David Bohm's version of the EPR experiment and of the Bell experiment are provided. Finally, references to links towards relativity theory and to quantum field theory are given.</description>

      <title>Quantum analog of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) and Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equations play an essential role for describing the dynamics of magnetization in solids. While a quantum analog of the LL dynamics has been proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 147201 (2013)], the corresponding quantum version of LLG remains unknown. Here, we propose such a quantum LLG equation that inherently conserves purity of the quantum state. We examine the quantum LLG dynamics of a dimer consisting of two interacting spin-1/2 particles. Our analysis reveals that, in the case of ferromagnetic coupling, the evolution of initially uncorrelated spins mirrors the classical LLG dynamics. However, in the antiferromagnetic scenario, we observe pronounced deviations from classical behavior, underscoring the unique dynamics of becoming a spinless state, which is non-locally correlated. Moreover, when considering spins that are initially correlated, our study uncovers an unusual form of transient quantum correlation dynamics, which differ significantly from what is typically seen in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Fused Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network is a powerful learning paradigm for data feature learning in the era of big data. However, most neural network models are deterministic models that ignore the uncertainty of data. Fuzzy neural networks are proposed to address this problem. FDNN is a hierarchical deep neural network that derives information from both fuzzy and neural representations, the representations are then fused to form representation to be classified. FDNN perform well on uncertain data classification tasks. In this paper, we proposed a novel hierarchical fused quantum fuzzy neural network (HQFNN). Different from classical FDNN, HQFNN uses quantum neural networks to learn fuzzy membership functions in fuzzy neural network. We conducted simulated experiment on two types of datasets (Dirty-MNIST and 15-Scene), the results show that the proposed model can outperform several existing methods. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Field test of mode-pairing quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution is a cornerstone of quantum technology, offering information-theoretical secure keys for remote parties. With many quantum communication networks established globally, the mode-pairing protocol stands out for its efficacy over inter-city distances using simple setups, emerging as a promising solution. In this study, we employ the mode-pairing scheme into existing inter-city fiber links, conducting field tests across distances ranging from tens to about a hundred kilometers. Our system achieves a key rate of $1.217$ kbit/s in a $195.85$ km symmetric link and $3.089$ kbit/s in a $127.92$ km asymmetric link without global phase locking. The results demonstrate that the mode-pairing protocol can achieve key rates comparable to those of a single quantum link between two trusted nodes on the Beijing-Shanghai backbone line, effectively reducing the need for half of the trusted nodes. These field tests confirm the mode-pairing scheme's adaptability, efficiency, and practicality, positioning it as a highly suitable protocol for quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum discord of an arbitrary two-qudit state: the exact value and general upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result indicates that the lower bound on the geometric quantum discord found in [Phys. Rev. A. 85, 204102 (2012)] is attained on each two-qudit state and also, includes all the known exact results on the geometric discord only as particular cases. Moreover, it allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the new general upper bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state and in case of a pure two-qudit state -- in terms of its concurrence.</description>

      <title>Emergence of entanglement and breakdown of causality in the quantum realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is the most striking but also most weird property in quantum mechanics. It has been confirmed by many experiments over decades through the criterion of violating Bell's inequality. However, a more fundamental problem arisen from EPR paradox is still not fully understood, that is, why quantum world emerges entanglement that classical physics does not. In this paper, we investigate the quantum dynamics of two photonic modes (or any two bosonic modes) coupled to each other through a beam splitting. Such a coupling fails to produce two-mode entanglement. We also start with a decoupled two-mode initial pure state, namely, no entanglement and no statistic feature to begin with. By solving the quantum equation of motion exactly without relying on the probabilistic interpretation, we find that when the initial wave function of one mode is different from a wave packet obeying minimum Heisenberg uncertainty (which corresponds to a well-defined classically particle), the causality in the time-evolution of another mode is broken down explicitly. It also leads to the emergence of quantum entanglement between the two modes. The lack of causality is the nature of statistics. The Bell's inequality only excludes the possible existence of local hidden variables for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. The internally causality breaking in the dynamical evolution of subsystems in isolated systems may answer the question how quantum dynamics generate naturally the probabilistic phenomena, even though the dynamical evolution of the whole system is completely described by the deterministic Schr\"{o}dinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider generating maximally entangled states (Bell states) between two qubits coupled to a common bosonic mode, based on f-STIRAP. Utilizing the systematic approach developed in New J. Phys. 19 093016 (2017), we quantify the effects of non-adiabatic leakage and system dissipation on the entanglement generation, and optimize the entanglement by balancing non-adiabatic leakage and system dissipation. We find the analytical expressions of the optimal coupling profile, the operation time, and the maximal entanglement. Our findings have broad applications in quantum state engineering, especially in solid-state devices where dissipative effects cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>Constrained and Vanishing Expressivity of Quantum Fourier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we highlight an unforeseen behavior of the expressivity of Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) for machine learning. A large class of these models, seen as Fourier Series which frequencies are derived from the encoding gates, were thought to have their Fourier coefficients mostly determined by the trainable gates. Here, we demonstrate a new correlation between the Fourier coefficients of the quantum model and its encoding gates. In addition, we display a phenomenon of vanishing expressivity in certain settings, where some Fourier coefficients vanish exponentially when the number of qubits grows. These two behaviors imply novel forms of constraints which limit the expressivity of PQCs, and therefore imply a new inductive bias for Quantum models. The key concept in this work is the notion of a frequency redundancy in the Fourier series spectrum, which determines its importance. Those theoretical behaviours are observed in numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have transformed how we interact with and understand the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the intersection of LLMs with the burgeoning field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is only in its nascent stages. This paper presents an exploration of this niche by detailing a comprehensive framework for implementing the foundational Transformer architecture -- integral to ChatGPT -- within a quantum computing paradigm. We meticulously design quantum circuits that implement adapted versions of the transformer's core components and the generative pre-training phase. By integrating quantum computing with LLMs, we aspire to open new avenues for research in QML and contribute to the ongoing evolution of AI technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum games embody non-intuitive consequences of quantum phenomena, such as entanglement and contextuality. The Mermin-Peres game is a simple example, demonstrating how two players can utilise shared quantum information to win a no - communication game with certainty, where classical players cannot. In this paper we look at the geometric structure behind such classical strategies, and borrow ideas from the geometry of symplectic polar spaces to maximise this quantum advantage. We introduce a new game called the Eloily game with a quantum-classical success gap of $0.2\overline{6}$, larger than that of the Mermin-Peres and doily games. We simulate this game in the IBM Quantum Experience and obtain a success rate of $1$, beating the classical bound of $0.7\overline{3}$ demonstrating the efficiency of the quantum strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic quantum circuits, classical information from mid-circuit measurements is fed forward during circuit execution. This emerging capability of quantum computers confers numerous advantages that can enable more efficient and powerful protocols by drastically reducing the resource requirements for certain core algorithmic primitives. In particular, in the case of the $n$-qubit quantum Fourier transform followed immediately by measurement, the scaling of resource requirements is reduced from $O(n^2)$ two-qubit gates in an all-to-all connectivity in the standard unitary formulation to $O(n)$ mid-circuit measurements in its dynamic counterpart without any connectivity constraints. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of dynamic quantum circuits for the quantum Fourier transform on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware with certified process fidelities of $&gt;50\%$ on up to $16$ qubits and $&gt;1\%$ on up to $37$ qubits, exceeding previous reports across all quantum computing platforms. These results are enabled by our contribution of an efficient method for certifying the process fidelity, as well as of a dynamical decoupling protocol for error suppression during mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward within a dynamic quantum circuit. Our results demonstrate the advantages of leveraging dynamic circuits in optimizing the compilation of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here we achieve the first simultaneous demonstration of thermalization and memory in a quantum system. Using a Rydberg atom array, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states from different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose efficient tensor network algorithms for optimizing control-enhanced sequential strategies in estimating a large number of quantum channels, with no ancilla or bounded ancilla. Our first approach allows for applying $N-1$ arbitrary interleaved control operations between the $N$ channels to estimate, and the second approach restricts all control operations to be identical, which could further facilitate simpler experimental demonstration. The numerical experiments show that our algorithm has a good performance in optimizing the metrological protocol for $N=100$ single-qubit and two-qubit channels. In particular, our algorithm identifies a strategy that can outperform the asymptotically optimal quantum error correction protocol when $N$ is finite but large.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Electrical Interface for Large-Scale Color-Center Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on color centers in diamond are promising candidates for future large-scale quantum computers thanks to their flexible optical interface, (relatively) high operating temperature, and high-fidelity operation. Similar to other quantum-computing platforms, the electrical interface required to control and read out such qubits may limit both the performance of the whole system and its scalability. To address this challenge, this work analyzes the requirements of the electrical interface and investigates how to efficiently implement the electronic controller in a scalable architecture comprising a large number of identical unit cells. Among the different discussed functionalities, a specific focus is devoted to the generation of the static and dynamic magnetic fields driving the electron and nuclear spins, because of their major impact on fidelity and scalability. Following the derived requirements, different system architectures, such as a qubit frequency-multiplexing scheme, are considered to identify the most power efficient approach, especially in the presence of inhomogeneity of the qubit Larmor frequency across the processor. As a result, a non-frequency-multiplexed, 1-mm$^2$ unit-cell architecture is proposed as the optimal solution, able to address up to one electron-spin qubit and 9 nuclear-spin qubits within a 3-mW average power consumption, thus establishing the baseline for the scalable electrical interface for future large-scale color-center quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Competing Interactions in Strongly Driven Multi-Level Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the level mixing, splitting and repulsion of an optically driven atomic multi-level system under two competing interactions. The strength of the optical coupling is increased until it surpasses the atomic hyperfine interaction responsible for mixing the magnetic substates. Due to the multi-level character of the coupled state space, the level shifts exhibit complex behavior reminiscent of the Paschen-Back effect. Our results show that multi-level effects can have significant influence for strong external drive, differing from a simple model of effective non-interacting two-level systems.

      <title>Non-Hermitian Persistent Current Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: ($i$) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; ($ii$) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalable Parity Architecture With a Shuttling-Based Spin Qubit Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the prospect of a two-dimensional square-lattice geometry for semiconductor spin qubits, we explore the realization of the Parity Architecture with quantum dots (QDs). This is part of the endeavor of developing architectures that advance the utilization of spin qubits for quantum computing while harnessing their advantages, such as their fast timescales -- especially of the nearest-neighbor interaction -- and small size. We present sequences of spin shuttling and quantum gates that implement the Parity Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a lattice constructed of identical unit cells, where the circuit depth is independent of the problem Hamiltonian and the system size. We further develop an error model, including a general description of the shuttling errors as a function of the probability distribution function of the valley splitting, and estimate the errors during one round of Parity QAOA, which is mainly limited by the valley splitting. Finally, we discuss the possibility of decoding the logical quantum state and of quantum error mitigation. We find that already with near-term spin qubit devices a sufficiently low physical error probability can be expected to reliably perform Parity QAOA with a short depth in a regime where the success probability compares favorably to standard QAOA.</description>

Abstract: We solve the infinite potential well problem using the methods of Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. In addition to being of educational value, the matrix mechanics allows us to deal with various unphysical issues caused by this potential in a seemingly unproblematic fashion.

      <title>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure, and can in fact be forged: recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. In this work we initiate the study of the dynamical generation and propagation of pseudoentanglement. As generic quantum dynamics tends to maximize actual entanglement, we consider constrained models of time evolution: automaton (i.e. reversible classical) circuits that, when fed suitable input states, provably produce the "standard models" of pseudoentangled ensembles--uniformly random subset(-phase) states--at late times, a phenomenon we name 'pseudothermalization'. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble is generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment (or number of copies). Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp pseudothermalization transitions.</description>

      <title>Physically motivated improvements of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) has emerged as a pivotal promising approach for electronic structure challenges in quantum chemistry with noisy quantum devices. Nevertheless, to surmount existing technological constraints, this study endeavors to enhance ADAPT-VQE's efficacy. Leveraging insights from electronic structure theory, we concentrate on optimizing state preparation without added computational burden and guiding ansatz expansion to yield more concise wavefunctions with expedited convergence toward exact solutions. These advancements culminate in shallower circuits and, as demonstrated, reduced measurement requirements. This research delineates these enhancements and assesses their performance across mono, di, and tridimensional arrangements of H4 models, as well as in the water molecule. Ultimately, this work attests to the viability of physically-motivated strategies in fortifying ADAPT-VQE's efficiency, marking a significant stride in quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra produced by high-harmonic generation (HHG) typically exhibit well-defined peaks at odd integers times the laser frequency. However, in recent investigations of HHG from correlated materials, spectra exhibit signals at noninteger harmonics which do not conform to the well-known symmetry-based selection rules for HHG-spectra. Here, we use the Fermi-Hubbard model to study HHG from a linear chain of atoms. This model allows us to study both the correlated and uncorrelated phases through a specification of the amount of onsite electron-electron repulsion. The presence of signal at noninteger harmonics can be interpreted as originating from the population of multiple Floquet states. We show how this coupling to different Floquet states depends on the characteristics of the driving pulse and the strength of the electron-electron interaction in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been 5 years since the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) Workshop on Next Steps in Quantum Computing, and significant progress has been made in closing the gap between useful quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. Yet much remains to be done, in particular in terms of mitigating errors and moving towards error-corrected machines. As we begin to transition from the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era to a future of fault-tolerant machines, now is an opportune time to reflect on how to apply what we have learned thus far and what research needs to be done to realize computational advantage with quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in $2+1$D~Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, high-energy eigenstates that evade the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the three-dimensional noncommutative relations of the positions and momenta operators to those in the four dimension. Using the Bopp shift technique, we give the Heisenberg representation of these noncommutative algebras and endow the noncommutative parameters associated with the Planck constant, Planck length and cosmological constant. As an analog with the electromagnetic gauge potential, the noncommutative effect can be interpreted as an effective gauge field, which depends on the Plank constant and cosmological constant. Based on these noncommutative relations, we give the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation and its corresponding current continuity equation in the noncommutative phase space including the canonical and Hamiltonian forms and their novel properties beyond the conventional KG equation. We analyze the symmetries of the KG equations and some observables such as velocity and force of free particles in the noncommutative phase space. We give the perturbation solution of the KG equation.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Spin Simulations of Magnetic Noise -- The Search for Pivoting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) show great promise as quantum bits (qubits) but continue to be hindered by flux noise. The flux noise power spectra of SQUIDs go as $1/f^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the temperature-dependent noise exponent. Experiments find $0.5 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 1$. Furthermore, experiments find that the noise power spectra versus frequency at different temperatures pivot about or cross at a common point for each SQUID. To try to better understand the results and motivated by experimental evidence that magnetic moments on the surface of SQUIDS produce flux noise, we present the results of our Monte Carlo simulations of various spin systems on 2D lattices. We find that only spin glasses produce $\alpha \sim 1$ at low temperature. We find that aliasing of the noise power spectra at high frequencies can lead to spectral pivoting if it is in proximity to a knee at a slightly lower frequency. We show that the pivot frequency depends on the method of site selection and how often the magnetization is recorded. The spectral pivoting that occurs in our simulations is due to aliasing and does not explain the spectral pivoting of experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the observation of single-photon generation from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 100 kcounts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. Also, the zero-phonon lines of these emitters are distributed in a spectrally narrow energy range. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Alternant Hydrocarbon Diradicals as Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row transition metal complexes via optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) mechanisms analogous to the diamond-NV colour centre. However, significantly less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most luminescent open-shell organic molecules are {\pi}-diradicals, but such systems often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realise a stable molecular qubit. In this work, we propose the use of alternancy symmetry to selectively minimise radical-radical interactions in the ground state, generating {\pi}-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers, referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms. The molecular parameters are set in the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of realising a molecular colour centre with alternant {\pi}-diradicals.</description>

      <title>Reverse em-problem based on Bregman divergence and its application to classical and quantum information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent paper (IEEE Trans. IT 69, 1680) introduced an analytical method for calculating the channel capacity without the need for iteration. This method has certain limitations that restrict its applicability. Furthermore, the paper does not provide an explanation as to why the channel capacity can be solved analytically in this particular case. In order to broaden the scope of this method and address its limitations, we turn our attention to the reverse em-problem, proposed by Toyota (Information Geometry, 3, 1355 (2020)). This reverse em-problem involves iteratively applying the inverse map of the em iteration to calculate the channel capacity, which represents the maximum mutual information. However, several open problems remained unresolved in Toyota's work. To overcome these challenges, we formulate the reverse em-problem based on Bregman divergence and provide solutions to these open problems. Building upon these results, we transform the reverse em-problem into em-problems and derive a non-iterative formula for the reverse em-problem. This formula can be viewed as a generalization of the aforementioned analytical calculation method. Importantly, this derivation sheds light on the information geometrical structure underlying this special case. By effectively addressing the limitations of the previous analytical method and providing a deeper understanding of the underlying information geometrical structure, our work significantly expands the applicability of the proposed method for calculating the channel capacity without iteration.</description>

Abstract: Advances in ultracold chemistry have led to the possibility of a coherent transformation between ultracold atoms and molecules including between completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of generic interaction between the formed molecules can fundamentally alter the nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by this rather general interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical and numerical descriptions of these many-body effects, along with scaling laws for the reaction yield in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes, and highlight the potential experimental relevance in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>A complete logic for causal consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ construction takes a base category of ``raw materials'' and builds a category of higher order causal processes, that is a category whose types encode causal (a.k.a. signalling) constraints between collections of systems. Notable examples are categories of higher-order stochastic maps and higher-order quantum channels. Well-typedness in $\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ corresponds to a composition of processes being causally consistent, in the sense that any choice of local processes of the prescribed types yields an overall process respecting causality constraints. It follows that closed processes always occur with probability 1, ruling out e.g. causal paradoxes arising from time loops. It has previously been shown that $\mathrm{Caus}[\mathcal{C}]$ gives a model of MLL+MIX and BV logic, hence these logics give sufficient conditions for causal consistency, but they fail to provide a complete characterisation. In this follow-on work, we introduce graph types as a tool to examine causal structures over graphs in this model. We explore their properties, standard forms, and equivalent definitions; in particular, a process obeys all signalling constraints of the graph iff it is expressible as an affine combination of factorisations into local causal processes connected according to the edges of the graph. The properties of graph types are then used to prove completeness for causal consistency of a new causal logic that conservatively extends pomset logic. The crucial extra ingredient is a notion of distinguished atoms that correspond to first-order states, which only admit a flow of information in one direction. Using the fact that causal logic conservatively extends pomset logic, we finish by giving a physically-meaningful interpretation to a separating statement between pomset and BV.</description>

Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational, entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions (based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
  We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C, Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.</description>

Abstract: We analyze band spectrum of the periodic quantum graph in the form of a chain of rings connected by line segments with the vertex coupling which violates the time reversal invariance, interpolating between the $\delta$ coupling and the one determined by a simple circulant matrix. We find that flat bands are generically absent and that the negative spectrum is nonempty even for interpolation with a non-attractive $\delta$ coupling; we also determine the high-energy asymptotic behavior of the bands.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-assisted optical communication with discretized state space of structural light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rich structure of the transverse spatial mode of structural light has facilitated its applications in quantum information and optical communication. The Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, with azimuthal and radial indexes, consist of a complete orthogonal basis to describe the transverse spatial mode of light. The azimuthal index is often endowed with the orbital angular momentum (OAM), a high dimensional degree of freedom. The advent of OAM in optical science marks a pivotal advancement, surpassing traditional optical techniques in light manipulation for advanced data encoding and signal transmission. Here, we present a scheme that utilizes the advanced deep learning technique for LG modes recognition. By discretizing the state space of the LG modes, a neural network model is trained to classify the given samples. A proof-of-principle experiment is performed to show that our scheme requires less samples for model training, while increasing the channel capacity within limited OAM number. We further apply our scheme to an image transmission task, demonstrating the ability to encode large data with low OAM number. Our work opens a new avenue for high capacity optical communication based on structural light.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring about a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. In addition, we propose a physical model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>

      <title>A semi-agnostic ansatz with variable structure for quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.06712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning -- and specifically Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) -- offers a powerful, flexible paradigm for programming near-term quantum computers, with applications in chemistry, metrology, materials science, data science, and mathematics. Here, one trains an ansatz, in the form of a parameterized quantum circuit, to accomplish a task of interest. However, challenges have recently emerged suggesting that deep ansatzes are difficult to train, due to flat training landscapes caused by randomness or by hardware noise. This motivates our work, where we present a variable structure approach to build ansatzes for VQAs. Our approach, called VAns (Variable Ansatz), applies a set of rules to both grow and (crucially) remove quantum gates in an informed manner during the optimization. Consequently, VAns is ideally suited to mitigate trainability and noise-related issues by keeping the ansatz shallow. We employ VAns in the variational quantum eigensolver for condensed matter and quantum chemistry applications, in the quantum autoencoder for data compression and in unitary compilation problems showing successful results in all cases.</description>

      <title>Decodable hybrid dynamics of open quantum systems with Z_2 symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a class of "open" quantum circuit models with local decoherence ("noise") and local projective measurements, each respecting a global Z_2 symmetry. The model supports a spin glass phase where the Z_2 symmetry is spontaneously broken (not possible in an equilibrium 1d system), a paramagnetic phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate "trivial" phase. All three phases are also stable to Z_2-symmetric local unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified by explicitly introducing a bath with its own "scrambling" dynamics, as in [Bao, Choi, Altman, arXiv:2102.09164], which does not change any of the universal physics. Within the spin glass phase the circuit dynamics can be interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code measured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin glass phase, we devise a novel decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and the ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final state. For a circuit with L^d qubits running for time T, the time needed to execute the decoder scales as O(L^d T) (with dimensionality d). With this decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit state can be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1d circuit, and for a time at least linear in L in 2d below a finite error threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare and contrast our decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the random bond Ising model.</description>

Abstract: Information spreads in time. For example, correlations dissipate when the correlated system locally couples to a third party, such as the environment. This simple but important fact forms the known quantum data-processing inequality. Here we theoretically uncover the quantum fluctuation theorem behind the quantum informational inequality. The fluctuation theorem quantitatively predicts the statistics of the underlying stochastic quantum process. To fully capture the quantum nature, the fluctuation theorem established here is extended to the quasiprobability regime. We also experimentally apply an interference-based method to measure the amplitudes composing the quasiprobability and verify our established fluctuation theorem by the IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the space overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The threshold theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation stating that arbitrarily long quantum computations can be performed with a polylogarithmic overhead provided the noise level is below a constant level. A recent work by Fawzi, Grospellier and Leverrier (FOCS 2018) building on a result by Gottesman (QIC 2013) has shown that the space overhead can be asymptotically reduced to a constant independent of the circuit provided we only consider circuits with a length bounded by a polynomial in the width. In this work, using a minimal model for quantum fault tolerance, we establish a general lower bound on the space overhead required to achieve fault tolerance.
  For any non-unitary qubit channel $\mathcal{N}$ and any quantum fault tolerance schemes against $\mathrm{i.i.d.}$ noise modeled by $\mathcal{N}$, we prove a lower bound of $\max\left\{\mathrm{Q}(\mathcal{N})^{-1}n,\alpha_\mathcal{N} \log T\right\}$ on the number of physical qubits, for circuits of length $T$ and width $n$. Here, $\mathrm{Q}(\mathcal{N})$ denotes the quantum capacity of $\mathcal{N}$ and $\alpha_\mathcal{N}&gt;0$ is a constant only depending on the channel $\mathcal{N}$. In our model, we allow for qubits to be replaced by fresh ones during the execution of the circuit and we allow classical computation to be free and perfect. This improves upon results that assumed classical computations to be also affected by noise, and that sometimes did not allow for fresh qubits to be added. Along the way, we prove an exponential upper bound on the maximal length of fault-tolerant quantum computation with amplitude damping noise resolving a conjecture by Ben-Or, Gottesman, and Hassidim (2013).</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) and their applications in the field of quantum machine learning through parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are thought to be one major way of leveraging noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing devices. However, differences in the performance of certain VQA architectures are often unclear since established best practices as well as detailed studies are missing. In this paper, we build upon the work by Schuld et al. and Vidal et al. and compare popular ans\"atze for PQCs through the new measure of learning capability. We also examine dissipative quantum neural networks (dQNN) as introduced by Beer et al. and propose a data re-upload structure for dQNNs to increase their learning capability. Comparing the results for the different PQC architectures, we can provide guidelines for designing efficient PQCs.</description>

Abstract: Risk measures are important key figures to measure the adequacy of the reserves of a company. The most common risk measures in practice are Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Recently, quantum-based algorithms are introduced to calculate them. These procedures are based on the so-called quantum amplitude estimation algorithm which lead to a quadratic speed up compared to classical Monte-Carlo based methods. Based on these ideas, we construct quantum-based algorithms to calculate alternatives for VaR and CVaR, namely the Expectile Value-at-Risk (EVaR) and the Range Value-at-Risk (RVaR). We construct quantum algorithms to calculate them. These algorithms are based on quantum amplitude estimation. In a case study, we compare their performance with the quantum-based algorithms for VaR and CVaR. We find that all of the algorithms perform sufficiently well on a quantum simulator. Further, the calculations of EVaR and VaR are robust against noise on a real quantum device. This is not the case for CVaR and RVaR.</description>

Abstract: Due to low numbers of qubits and their error-proneness, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers impose constraints on the size of quantum algorithms they can successfully execute. State-of-the-art research introduces various techniques addressing these limitations by utilizing known or inexpensively generated approximations, solutions, or models as a starting point to approach a task instead of starting from scratch. These so-called warm-starting techniques aim to reduce quantum resource consumption, thus facilitating the design of algorithms suiting the capabilities of NISQ computers. In this work, we collect and analyze scientific literature on warm-starting techniques in the quantum computing domain. In particular, we (i) create a systematic map of state-of-the-art research on warm-starting techniques using established guidelines for systematic mapping studies, (ii) identify relevant properties of such techniques, and (iii) based on these properties classify the techniques identified in the literature in an extensible classification scheme. Our results provide insights into the research field and aim to help quantum software engineers to categorize warm-starting techniques and apply them in practice. Moreover, our contributions may serve as a starting point for further research on the warm-starting topic since they provide an overview of existing work and facilitate the identification of research gaps.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is effective in reducing gate errors in most quantum computation platforms and is therefore projected to play an essential role in future fault-tolerant constructions. In superconducting circuits, however, it has proven difficult to utilize the benefits of dynamical decoupling. In this work, we present a theoretical proposal that incorporates a continuous version of dynamical decoupling, namely spin locking, with a coupler-based CZ gate for transmons and provide analytical and numerical results that demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: We consider a quantum system that is being continuously monitored, giving rise to a measurement signal. From such a stream of data, information needs to be inferred about the underlying system's dynamics. Here we focus on hypothesis testing problems and put forward the usage of sequential strategies where the signal is analyzed in real time, allowing the experiment to be concluded as soon as the underlying hypothesis can be identified with a certified prescribed success probability. We analyze the performance of sequential tests by studying the stopping-time behavior, showing a considerable advantage over currently-used strategies based on a fixed predetermined measurement time.</description>

Abstract: Trapped ions in radio-frequency traps are among the leading approaches for realizing quantum computers, due to high-fidelity quantum gates and long coherence times. However, the use of radio-frequencies presents a number of challenges to scaling, including requiring compatibility of chips with high voltages, managing power dissipation and restricting transport and placement of ions. By replacing the radio-frequency field with a 3 T magnetic field, we here realize a micro-fabricated Penning ion trap which removes these restrictions. We demonstrate full quantum control of an ion in this setting, as well as the ability to transport the ion arbitrarily in the trapping plane above the chip. This unique feature of the Penning micro-trap approach opens up a modification of the Quantum CCD architecture with improved connectivity and flexibility, facilitating the realization of large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Position dependence of Nielsen complexity for the Thermofield double state</title>

Abstract: In this paper, the Nielsen geometric method is used to study the position dependence of the Nielsen complexity for the thermofield double state of a harmonic oscillator. We present the state shift under the influence of an external electric field and demonstrate its importance for the construction of the corresponding circuit. By numerical analysis, we investigate the effect of the frequency and the external field on the dynamics of complexity. Our observation reveals that the system's complexity diminishes considerably with the rise of the frequency. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the complexity exhibits a distinct behavior under a feeble external electric field, as it grows more intricate with the escalation of the frequency. However, with higher magnitudes of the electric field, the system reverts to its prior behavior. We also remark on the influence of the reference state's frequency on the complexity.</description>

      <title>Neutron spin echo is a "quantum tale of two paths''</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an experiment that strongly supports a two-path interferometric model in which the spin-up and spin-down components of each neutron propagate coherently along spatially separated parallel paths in a typical neutron spin echo small angle scattering (SESANS) experiment. Specifically, we show that the usual semi-classical, single-path treatment of Larmor precession of a polarized neutron in an external magnetic field predicts a damping as a function of the spin echo length of the SESANS signal obtained with a periodic phase grating when the transverse width of the neutron wave packet is finite. However, no such damping is observed experimentally, implying either that the Larmor model is incorrect or that the transverse extent of the wave packet is very large. In contrast, we demonstrate theoretically that a quantum-mechanical interferometric model in which the two mode-entangled (i.e. intraparticle entangled) spin states of a single neutron are separated in space when they interact with the grating accurately predicts the measured SESANS signal, which is independent of the wave packet width.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating parametric drive of coupled classical oscillators can simulate dissipative qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a system composed of two coupled oscillators subject to stochastic fluctuations in its internal parameters. In particular, we answer the question whether the well-known classical analogy of the quantum dynamics of two-level systems (TLS), i.e. qubits, provided by two coupled oscillators can be extended to simulate the dynamics of dissipative quantum systems. In the context of nanomechanics, the analogy in the dissipation free case has already been tested in multiple experimental setups, e.g., doubly clamped or cantilever string resonators and optically levitated particles. A well-known result of this classical analogy is that the relaxation and decoherence times of the analog quantum system must be equal, i.e. $T_1=T_2$, in contrast to the general case of quantum TLS. We show that this fundamentally quantum feature, i.e. $T_1\neq T_2$, can be implemented as well in the aforementioned classical systems by adding stochastic fluctuations in their internal parameters. Moreover, we show that these stochastic contributions can be engineered in the control apparatus of those systems, discussing, in particular, the application of this theory to levitated nanoparticles and to nanostring resonators.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus in finite local-depth circuits with long-range entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians. On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local 2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training using the generalized toric code model.</description>

      <title>Hardy-type paradoxes for an arbitrary symmetric bipartite Bell scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As with a Bell inequality, Hardy's paradox manifests a contradiction between the prediction given by quantum theory and local-hidden variable theories. In this work, we give two generalizations of Hardy's arguments for manifesting such a paradox to an arbitrary, but symmetric Bell scenario involving two observers. Our constructions recover that of Meng et al. [Phys. Rev. A. 98, 062103 (2018)] and that first discussed by Cabello [Phys. Rev. A 65, 032108 (2002)] as special cases. Among the two constructions, one can be naturally interpreted as a demonstration of the failure of the transitivity of implications (FTI). Moreover, a special case of which is equivalent to a ladder-proof-type argument for Hardy's paradox. Through a suitably generalized notion of success probability called degree of success, we provide evidence showing that the FTI-based formulation exhibits a higher degree of success compared with all other existing proposals. Moreover, this advantage seems to persist even if we allow imperfections in realizing the zero-probability constraints in such paradoxes. Explicit quantum strategies realizing several of these proofs of nonlocality without inequalities are provided.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks have emerged as a transformative paradigm in quantum information processing and can be applied to various graph problems. This study explores discrete-time quantum walks on simplicial complexes, a higher-order generalization of graph structures. Simplicial complexes, encoding higher-order interactions through simplices, offer a richer topological representation of complex systems. Leveraging algebraic topology and discrete-time quantum walk, we present a quantum walk algorithm for detecting higher-order community structures called simplicial communities. We utilize the Fourier coin to produce entangled translation states among adjacent simplices in a simplicial complex. The potential of our quantum algorithm is tested on Zachary's karate club network. This study may contribute to understanding complex systems at the intersection of algebraic topology and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics is to properly quantify the work extractable from out-of-equilibrium systems. While for closed systems, maximum quantum work extraction is defined in terms of the ergotropy functional, this question is unclear in open systems interacting with an environment. The concept of local ergotropy has been proposed, but it presents several problems, such as it is not guaranteed to be non-increasing in time. Here we introduce the concept of extended local ergotropy by exploiting the free evolution of the system-environment compound. At variance with the local ergotropy, the extended local ergotropy is greater, is non-increasing in time, and activates the potential of work extraction in many cases. We then concentrate on specific schemes in which we alternate repeated local unitaries and free system-environment evolution. We provide examples based on the Jaynes-Cummings model, presenting practical protocols and analytic results that serve as proof of principle for the aforementioned advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>

Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of interacting many-body systems on present day quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) scheme is one of the popular fragmentation-based methods and has the potential advantage of making the circuit flat in quantum chemical calculations on quantum computers. In this study, we used a GPU-accelerated quantum simulator (cuQuantum) to perform the electron correlation part of the FMO calculation as unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for hydrogen-bonded (FH)$_3$ and (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O systems with the STO-3G basis set. VQE-UCCD calculations were performed using both canonical and localized MO sets, and the results were examined from the point of view of size-consistency and orbital-invariance affected by the Trotter error. It was found that the use of localized MO leads to better results, especially for (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O. The GPU acceleration was substantial for the simulations with larger numbers of qubits, and was about a factor of 6.7--7.7 for 18 qubit systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum rotor represents the second simplest model after the harmonic oscillator with profound interdisciplinary but yet unexplored implications. It overreaches its mechanical meaning with significant consequences and promising applications in, e.g., singular optics, super-conductive circuits with Josephson junction or optimal pulse shaping in time frequency domains at ultimate quantum limit. Quantification of complementarity between angular momentum and angular variable is essential for exploitation of this canonical pair in quantum metrology. Whereas the natural measures for position and momentum are variances, the uncertainty associated with angular variable can be linked to moments of inertia of the unit ring about axes passing through its center of mass. This interpretation provides variants for saturable uncertainty relations which can be further used in quantum metrology of the quantum rotor and explains ambiguities in choice of possible uncertainty measures associated with sine and cosine functions of angular variable. Special attention will be payed to uncertainty products which are exactly or approximately minimised by von Mises states, which play the role of squeezed states for quantum rotor and allow optimal detection of quantum states at the ultimate limits.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit Dynamical Decoupling for Enhanced Crosstalk Suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is one of the simplest error suppression methods, aiming to enhance the coherence of qubits in open quantum systems. Moreover, DD has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing coherent crosstalk, one major error source in near-term quantum hardware, which manifests from two types of interactions. Static crosstalk exists in various hardware platforms, including superconductor and semiconductor qubits, by virtue of always-on qubit-qubit coupling. Additionally, driven crosstalk may occur as an unwanted drive term due to leakage from driven gates on other qubits. Here we explore a novel staggered DD protocol tailored for multi-qubit systems that suppresses the decoherence error and both types of coherent crosstalk. We develop two experimental setups - an "idle-idle" experiment in which two pairs of qubits undergo free evolution simultaneously and a "driven-idle" experiment in which one pair is continuously driven during the free evolution of the other pair. These experiments are performed on an IBM Quantum superconducting processor and demonstrate the significant impact of the staggered DD protocol in suppressing both types of coherent crosstalk. When compared to the standard DD sequences from state-of-the-art methodologies with the application of X2 sequences, our staggered DD protocol enhances circuit fidelity by 19.7% and 8.5%, respectively, in addressing these two crosstalk types.</description>

Abstract: We propose a state preparation protocol based on sequential measurements of a central spin coupled with a spin ensemble, and investigate the usefulness of the generated multi-spin states for quantum enhanced metrology. Our protocol is shown to generate highly entangled spin states, devoid of the necessity for non-linear spin interactions. The metrological sensitivity of the resulting state surpasses the standard quantum limit, reaching the Heisenberg limit under symmetric coupling strength conditions. We also explore asymmetric coupling strengths, identifying specific preparation windows in time for optimal sensitivity. Our findings introduce a novel method for generating large-scale, non-classical, entangled states, enhancing quantum-enhanced metrology within current experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Better than classical? The subtle art of benchmarking quantum machine learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmarking models via classical simulations is one of the main ways to judge ideas in quantum machine learning before noise-free hardware is available. However, the huge impact of the experimental design on the results, the small scales within reach today, as well as narratives influenced by the commercialisation of quantum technologies make it difficult to gain robust insights. To facilitate better decision-making we develop an open-source package based on the PennyLane software framework and use it to conduct a large-scale study that systematically tests 12 popular quantum machine learning models on 6 binary classification tasks used to create 160 individual datasets. We find that overall, out-of-the-box classical machine learning models outperform the quantum classifiers. Moreover, removing entanglement from a quantum model often results in as good or better performance, suggesting that "quantumness" may not be the crucial ingredient for the small learning tasks considered here. Our benchmarks also unlock investigations beyond simplistic leaderboard comparisons, and we identify five important questions for quantum model design that follow from our results.</description>

Abstract: A procedure is presented for solving the Fokker-Planck equation with constant diffusion but non-stationary drift. It is based on the correspondence between the Fokker-Planck equation and the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation. The formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is extended by applying the Darboux transformation directly to the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation. From a solution of a Fokker-Planck equation a solution of the Darboux partner is obtained. For drift coefficients satisfying the condition of shape invariance, a supersymmetric hierarchy of Fokker-Planck equations with solutions related by the Darboux transformation is obtained.</description>

Abstract: Nascent quantum computers motivate the exploration of quantum many-body systems in nontraditional scenarios. For example, it has become natural to explore the dynamics of systems evolving under both unitary evolution and measurement. Such systems can undergo dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement properties of quantum trajectories conditional on the measurement outcomes. Here, we explore dynamics in which one attempts to (locally) use those measurement outcomes to steer the system toward a target state, and we study the resulting phase diagram as a function of the measurement and feedback rates. Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates exceed a threshold, yielding an absorbing-state transition in the trajectory-averaged density matrix. We argue that the absorbing-state transition generally occurs at different critical parameters from the entanglement transition in individual trajectories and has distinct critical properties. The efficacy of steering depends on the nature of the target state: in particular, for local dynamics targeting long-range correlated states, steering is necessarily slow and the entanglement and steering transitions are well separated in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in coupled one-dimensional quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the development of steady states in one-dimensional Bose gas tubes that are weakly coupled to one another through a density-density interaction. We analyze this development through a Boltzmann collision integral approach. We argue that when the leading order of the collision integral, where single particle-hole excitations are created in individual gases, is dominant, the state of the gas evolves first to a non-thermal fixed point, i.e. a prethermalization plateau. This order is dominant when a pair of tubes are inequivalent with, say, different temperatures or different effective interaction parameters, $\gamma$. We characterize this non-thermal prethermalization plateau, constructing both the quasi-conserved quantities that control the existence of this plateau as well as the associated generalized Gibbs ensemble.</description>

      <title>A generalized dominance ordering for 1/2-BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a generalized dominance ordering for irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_{n}$ with the aim of distinguishing the corresponding states in the 1/2-BPS sector of $U(N)$ Super Yang-Mills theory when a certain finite number of Casimir operators are known. Having knowledge of a restricted set of Casimir operators was proposed as a mechanism for information loss in this sector and its dual gravity theory in AdS$_{5}\times S^{5}$. It is well-known that the states in this sector are labeled by Young diagrams with $n$ boxes. We propose a generalization of the well-known dominance ordering of Young diagrams. Using this generalization, we posit a conjecture to determine an upper bound for the number of Casimir operators needed to distinguish between the 1/2-BPS states and thus also between their duals in the gravity theory. We offer numerical and analytic evidence for the conjecture. Lastly, we discuss implications of this conjecture when the energy $n$ of the states is asymptotically large.</description>

      <title>Measuring Renyi Entropy in Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Renyi entropy in a one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising model by employing a swapping operator acting on the states which are prepared from the neural network methods. In the static ground state, Renyi entropy can uncover the critical point of the quantum phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. At the critical point, the relation between the Renyi entropy and the subsystem size satisfies the predictions from conformal field theory. In the dynamical case, we find coherent oscillations of the Renyi entropy after the end of the linear quench. These oscillations have universal frequencies which may come from the superpositions of excited states. The asymptotic form of the Renyi entropy implies a new length scale away from the critical point. This length scale is also verified by the overlap of the reduced Renyi entropy against the dimensionless subsystem size.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of a trapped atom interferometer with accelerating optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to increase the measured phase of an atom interferometer and improve its sensitivity, researchers attempt to increase the enclosed space-time area using two methods: creating larger separations between the interferometer arms and having longer evolution times. However, increasing the evolution time reduces the bandwidth that can be sampled, whereas decreasing the evolution time worsens the sensitivity. In this paper, we attempt to address this by proposing a setup for high-bandwidth applications, with improved overall sensitivity. This is realized by accelerating and holding the atoms using optical dipole traps. We find that accelerations of up to $10^{3}$-$10^{5}$ m/s$^2$ can be achieved using acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) to move the traps. By comparing the sensitivity of our approach to acceleration as a baseline to traditional atom interferometry, we find a substantial improvement to the state of the art. In the limit of appropriate beam and optics stabilization, sensitivities approaching 10$^{-14}$ (m/s$^2$)/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ may be achievable at 1 Hz, while detection at 1 kHz with a sensitivity an order of magnitude better than traditional free-fall atom interferometers is possible with today's systems.</description>

      <title>Absence of Spin Liquid Phase in the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth investigation of the phase diagram of the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We take advantage of Density Matrix Renormalization Group and Fully-Augmented Matrix Product States methods and reach unprecedented accuracy with large bond dimensions. We utilize excited-level crossing analysis to pinpoint the phase transition points. It was believed before that there exists a narrow spin liquid phase sandwiched by the N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) and valence bond solid (VBS) phases. Through careful finite size scaling of the level crossing points, we find a direct phase transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$, suggesting the absence of an intermediate spin liquid phase. We also provide accurate results for ground state energies for a variety of sizes, from which we find the transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases is continuous. These results indicate the existence of a deconfined quantum critical point at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$ in the model. From the crossing of the first derivative of the energies with $J_2$ for different sizes, we also determine the precise location of the first order phase transition between the VBS and stripe AFM phases at $J_2/J_1=0.610(5)$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic phases in first detected return times of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial state of a quantum many-body system subject to stroboscopic projective measurements. We show that this distribution can be interpreted as a continuation of the canonical partition function of a spin chain with non-interacting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterised by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to show that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially asymptotically in time, depending on whether the spin model displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behaviour, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time with $N$. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by exact numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a low loss, highly stable and re-useable edge coupler for high heralding efficiency and low g^(2) (0) SOI correlated photon pair sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a stable, low loss method for coupling light from silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic chips into optical fibers. The technique is realized using an on-chip tapered waveguide and a cleaved small core optical fiber. The on-chip taper is monolithic and does not require a patterned cladding, thus simplifying the chip fabrication process. The optical fiber segment is composed of a centimeter-long small core fiber (UHNA7) which is spliced to SMF-28 fiber with less than -0.1 dB loss. We observe an overall coupling loss of -0.64 dB with this design. The chip edge and fiber tip can be butt coupled without damaging the on-chip taper or fiber. Friction between the surfaces maintains alignment leading to an observation of +-0.1 dB coupling fluctuation during a ten-day continuous measurement without use of any adhesive. This technique minimizes the potential for generating Raman noise in the fiber, and has good stability compared to coupling strategies based on longer UHNA fibers or fragile lensed fibers. We also applied the edge coupler on a correlated photon pair source and observed a raw coincidence count rate of 1.21 million cps and raw heralding efficiency of 21.3%. We achieved an auto correlation function g^(2) (0) as low as 0.0004 at the low pump power regime.</description>
