      <title>Probabilistic Construction of Kakeya-Type Sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ associated to separated sets of directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a condition on a set of directions $\Omega \subset \mathbb{S}^1$ ensuring that the associated directional maximal operator $M_\Omega$ is unbounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for every $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$. The techniques of proof extend ideas of Bateman and Katz involving probabilistic construction of Kakeya-type sets involving sticky maps and Bernoulli percolation.</description>

      <title>Selector form of Weaver's conjecture, Feichtinger's conjecture, and frame sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show an extension of a probabilistic result of Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava, which resolved the Kadison-Singer problem, for block diagonal positive semidefinite random matrices. We use this result to show several selector results, which generalize their partition counterparts. This includes a selector form of Weaver's KS$_r$ conjecture for block diagonal trace class operators, which extends a selector result for Bessel sequences, or equivalently rank one matrices, due to Londner and the author. We also show a selector variant of Feichtinger's conjecture for a (possibly infinite) collection of Bessel sequences, extending earlier results for a single Bessel sequence. We prove a generalization of the $R_\epsilon$ conjecture of Casazza, Tremain, and Vershynin for infinite collection of equal norm Bessel sequences. In particular, our selector result yields a conjectured asymptotically optimal bound for a single Bessel sequence in terms of Riesz sequence tightness parameter.
  We establish an iterated selector form of Weaver's KS$_2$ conjecture and show its applications. This includes a solution of an open problem on nearly unit norm Parseval frames of exponentials, which was posed by Londner and the author. We generalize a discretization result for continuous frames by Freeman and Speegle in two ways. First, we extend their result from the setting of rank one operators to positive trace operator valued measures. Second, we establish a nearly tight discretization of bounded continuous Parseval frames. In particular, our selector result yields an improvement of the result of Nitzan, Olevskii, and Ulanovskii and implies the existence of nearly tight exponential frames for unbounded sets with an explicit control on their frame redundancy.</description>

      <title>The Ross-Darboux-Stieltjes Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of the traditional definitions of the Riemann-Stieltjes and Darboux-Stieltjes integrals, we introduce a generalized Darboux-Stieltjes integral that is equivalent to an earlier generalization by Ross \cite{Ross}. Our definition builds upon an approach to the Darboux-Stieltjes integral recently introduced by the first author and Convertito \cite{TSI}. We show that our definition agrees with all previous definitions, but that the class of integrable functions is much larger. We develop all the analogs of the classic results for the Riemann integral, and rectify the problems inherent in the definition of the Darboux-Stieltjes integral in \cite{TSI}. In particular, we show the Bounded Convergence Theorem holds for our definition and that it agrees with the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral.</description>

      <title>On Polynomial Carleson operators along quadratic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a maximally modulated singular oscillatory integral operator along a hypersurface defined by $(y,Q(y))\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, for an arbitrary non-degenerate quadratic form $Q$, admits an a priori bound on $L^p$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, for each $n \geq 2$. This operator takes the form of a polynomial Carleson operator of Radon-type, in which the maximally modulated phases lie in the real span of $\{p_2,\ldots,p_d\}$ for any set of fixed real-valued polynomials $p_j$ such that $p_j$ is homogeneous of degree $j$, and $p_2$ is not a multiple of $Q(y)$. The general method developed in this work applies to quadratic forms of arbitrary signature, while previous work considered only the special positive definite case $Q(y)=|y|^2$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic estimates for degenerate elliptic systems on manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bounds and boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted quadratic estimates are proved for certain bisectorial firstorder differential operators with bounded measurable coefficients which are (not necessarily pointwise) accretive, on complete manifolds with positive injectivity radius. As compared to earlier results, Ricci curvature is only assumed to be bounded from below, and the weight is only assumed to be locally in A^2. The Kato square root estimate is proved under this weaker assumption. On compact Lipschitz manifolds we prove solvability estimates for solutions to degenerate elliptic systems with not necessarily self-adjoint coefficients, and with Dirichlet, Neumann and Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>One Dimensional Dynamics and the R\"ossler attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\"ossler system is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, generating a chaotic attractor which, by the numerical evidence, arises by a period-doubling route to chaos. In this paper we state and prove a topological criterion for the existence of an attractor for the R\"ossler system - and then analyze the dynamics of the non-wandering set by reducing the flow to the dynamics of a well-known one dimensional model: the Quadratic Family, $x^2+c$, $-2\leq c\leq\frac{1}{4}$.</description>
