      <title>Large-scale stochastic simulation of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A strong-driving toolkit for topological Floquet energy pumps with superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.</description>

      <title>Measuring decoherence due to quantum vacuum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations -- which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter -- can lead to observable irreversible decoherence, if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>String Breaking in a $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String breaking is an intriguing phenomenon crucial to the understanding of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), with strong relevance to both condensed matter and high-energy physics (HEP). Recent experiments investigating string breaking in $2+1$D (two spatial and one temporal dimensions) LGTs motivate a thorough analysis of its underlying mechanisms. Here, we perform matrix product state (MPS) simulations of string breaking in an experimentally relevant $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in the presence of two external charges. We provide a detailed description of the system in the confined phase, highlight a number of mechanisms which are responsible for string breaking, and argue that magnetic fluctuations have a stabilizing effect on the strings. Moreover, we show that deep in the confined regime the problem is dual to one-dimensional free fermions hopping on an open chain. Our work elucidates the microscopic processes of string breaking in $2+1$D LGTs, and our findings can be probed on current superconducting-qubit quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing from Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stabilizer tableaus have proven exceptionally useful as a descriptive tool for additive quantum codes, they offer little guidance for concrete constructions or coding algorithm analysis. We introduce a representation of stabilizer codes as graphs with certain structures. Specifically, the graphs take a semi-bipartite form where input nodes map to output nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. Intuitively, the graph's input-output edges represent information propagation of the encoder, while output-output edges represent the code's entanglement. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a universal recipe for code construction by finding graphs with nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes. We construct several constant-size codes and several infinite code families. We also use graphs to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound to a three-way distance-rate-weight trade-off. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms, distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding, are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing encoding circuits whose depths scale with the degree and for implementing certain logical diagonal and Clifford gates with reduced depth. Finally, we find an efficient decoding algorithm for certain classes of graphs. These results give evidence that graphs are useful for the study of quantum computing and its implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a squeeze operator transformation approach to solve the anisotropic quantum Rabi model that includes a diamagnetic term. By carefully adjusting the amplitude of the diamagnetic term, we demonstrate that the anisotropic Rabi model with the $A^2$ term can be exactly reduced to either a Jaynes-Cummings or an anti-Jaynes-Cummings model without requiring any approximations.</description>

      <title>A Linear Quantum Coupler for Clean Bosonic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</description>

      <title>Realization of Two-dimensional Discrete Time Crystals with Anisotropic Heisenberg Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete time crystal (DTC) is the paradigmatic example of a phase of matter that occurs exclusively in systems out of equilibrium. This phenomenon is characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of discrete time-translation and provides a rich playground to study a fundamental question in statistical physics: what mechanism allows for driven quantum systems to exhibit emergent behavior that deviates from their counterparts with time-independent evolution? Unlike equilibrium phases, DTCs exhibit macroscopic manifestations of coherent quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional narrative that thermodynamic behavior universally erases quantum signatures. However, due to the difficulty of simulating these systems with either classical or quantum computers, previous studies have been limited to a set of models with Ising-like couplings -- and mostly only in one dimension -- thus precluding our understanding of the existence (or not) of DTCs in models with interactions that closely align with what occurs in nature. In this work, by combining the latest generation of IBM quantum processors with state-of-the-art tensor network methods, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a DTC in a two-dimensional system governed by anisotropic Heisenberg interactions. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a rich phase diagram encompassing spin-glass, ergodic, and time-crystalline phases, highlighting the tunability of these phases through multiple control parameters. Crucially, our results emphasize the interplay of initialization, interaction anisotropy, and driving protocols in stabilizing the DTC phase. By extending the study of Floquet matter beyond simplified models, we lay the groundwork for exploring how driven systems bridge the gap between quantum coherence and emergent non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Sudden Decoherence by Resonant Particle Excitation for Testing Gravity-Induced Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe gravity-induced entanglement. We consider the gravitational interaction between a particle trapped in a shallow potential and a harmonic oscillator. The harmonic oscillator is in a quantum superposition of two frequencies and only one of these states can excite the trapped particle via resonance. Once the excited particle is detected, the quantum state of the oscillator is collapsed, which can be observed as the sudden disappearance of the superposition of oscillator frequencies. Thus, the sudden decoherence, which is only triggered by particle detection, can be a smoking gun evidence of gravity-induced entanglement. Since the probability of particle excitation increases linearly with time, the total probability is multiplied by repeating experiments. We will also discuss experimental implementations using optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Experimental relativistic zero-knowledge proofs with unconditional security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are widely applied in digital economies, such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, for establishing trust and ensuring privacy between untrusted parties. However, almost all ZKPs rely on unproven computational assumptions or are vulnerable to quantum adversaries. We propose and experimentally implement an unconditionally secure ZKP for the graph three-coloring problem by combining subset relativistic bit commitments with quantum nonlocality game. Our protocol achieves a linear relationship between interactive rounds and the number of edges, reducing round complexity and storage requirements by thirteen orders of magnitude, thereby significantly enhancing practical feasibility. Our work illustrates the powerful potential of integrating special relativity with quantum theory in trustless cryptography, paving the way for robust applications against quantum attacks in distrustful internet environments.</description>

      <title>QNN-QRL: Quantum Neural Network Integrated with Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a critical component of secure communication in the quantum era, ensuring information-theoretic security. Despite its potential, there are issues in optimizing key generation rates, enhancing security, and incorporating QKD into practical implementations. This research introduces a unique framework for incorporating quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms, notably quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) and quantum neural networks (QNN), into QKD protocols to improve key generation performance. Here, we present two novel QRL-based algorithms, QRL-V.1 and QRL-V.2, and propose the standard BB84 and B92 protocols by integrating QNN algorithms to form QNN-BB84 and QNN-B92. Furthermore, we combine QNN with the above QRL-based algorithms to produce QNN-QRL-V.1 and QNN-QRL-V.2. These unique algorithms and established protocols are compared using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. The results from the QNN-based proposed algorithms show considerable improvements in key generation quality. The existing and proposed models are investigated in the presence of different noisy channels to check their robustness. The proposed integration of QML algorithms into QKD protocols and their noisy analysis create a new paradigm for efficient key generation, which advances the practical implementation of QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-controlled robust tripartite quantum entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of highly entangled states involving multiparticle systems is of crucial importance in quantum physics, playing a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics and offering essential quantum resources for nascent quantum technologies that surpass classical limits. Here we present how to generate and manipulate tripartite entangled state of photons, phonons, and magnons within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. It is shown that by simultaneously applying two coherent driving fields to this system in opposite input directions, it enables a coherent and effective way to regulate the magnomechanical interaction by tuning the phase difference of the driving fields. Based on this feature, it is found that the tripartite entanglement also becomes phase-dependent and can be enhanced for certain phase difference. More interestingly, it is shown that the robustness of tripartite entanglement against environmental thermal noises can also be improved by choosing proper phase difference of the driving fields. Our findings open up a promising way to manipulate and protect fragile tripartite entanglement, which is applicable to a wide range of quantum protocols that require multipartite entangled resources such as quantum communication and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Generation on the Double Quantum Transition of NV Ground State Via Globally Addressing Microwave Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key quantum feature that enables quantum sensors to improve their sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. In the NV-center platform, the Heisenberg limit can only be achieved when the axes of the NV centers are parallel. Nevertheless, parallel NV centers are spectrally indistinguishable and no mechanisms to prepare entanglement in such configurations are known to date. In this work we propose for the first time a mechanism to prepare entangled states in the double quantum transition of two dipolarly coupled NV centers whose axes are parallel. Our approach is based on the NV effective Raman coupling (NV-ERC) protocol and makes use of global addressing of both NV centers with a single monochromatic microwave pulse. Supported by an adiabatic elimination analysis, several mechanisms for the preparation of different entangled states are identified which avoid participation of intermediate states in all cases, thus limiting the impact of additional unwanted noise sources. We consider the generation of different entangled states belonging to the double quantum transition, sensitive to either transverse electric fields or longitudinal magnetic fields, all with a fourfold improved sensitivity compared to conventional single NV settings.</description>

      <title>Squeezing-enhanced accurate differential sensing under large phase noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are reaching sensitivities fundamentally constrained by quantum fluctuations. A main challenge is to integrate entanglement into quantum sensing protocols to enhance precision while ensuring robustness against noise and systematics. Here, we theoretically investigate differential phase measurements with two atom interferometers using spin-squeezed states, accounting for common-mode phase noise spanning the full $2\pi$ range. We estimate the differential signal using model-free ellipse fitting, a robust method requiring no device calibration and resilient to additional noise sources. Our results show that spin-squeezing enables sensitivities below the standard quantum limit. Specifically, we identify optimal squeezed states that minimize the differential phase variance, scaling as $N^{-2/3}$, while eliminating bias inherent in ellipse fitting methods. We benchmark our protocol against the Cram\'er-Rao bound and compare it with hybrid methods that incorporate auxiliary classical sensors. Our findings provide a pathway to robust and high-precision atom interferometry, in realistic noisy environments and using readily available states and estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Squeezing at the normal-mode splitting frequency of a nonlinear coupled cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled optical cavities, which support normal modes, play a critical role in optical filtering, sensing, slow-light generation, and quantum state manipulation. Recent theoretical work has proposed incorporating nonlinear materials into these systems to enable novel quantum technologies. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of squeezing generated in a quantum-enhanced coupled-cavity system, achieving a quantum noise reduction of 3.5 dB at a normal-mode splitting frequency of 7.47 MHz. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's loss mechanisms and performance limitations, validating theoretical predictions. Our results underscore the promise of coupled-cavity squeezers for advanced quantum applications, including gravitational wave detection and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Direct Implementation of High-Fidelity Three-Qubit Gates for Superconducting Processor with Tunable Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-qubit gates can be constructed using combinations of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, making their independent realization unnecessary. However, direct implementation of three-qubit gates reduces the depth of quantum circuits, streamlines quantum programming, and facilitates efficient circuit optimization, thereby enhancing overall performance in quantum computation. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity scheme for implementing a three-qubit controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate in a flip-chip superconducting quantum processor with tunable couplers. This direct CCZ gate is implemented by simultaneously leveraging two tunable couplers interspersed between three qubits to enable three-qubit interactions, achieving an average final state fidelity of $97.94\%$ and a process fidelity of $93.54\%$. This high fidelity cannot be achieved through a simple combination of single- and two-qubit gate sequences from processors with similar performance levels. Our experiments also verify that multi-layer direct implementation of the CCZ gate exhibits lower leakage compared to decomposed gate approaches. To further showcase the versatility of our approach, we construct a Toffoli gate by combining the CCZ gate with Hadamard gates. As a showcase, we utilize the CCZ gate as an oracle to implement the Grover search algorithm on three qubits, demonstrating high performance with the target probability amplitude significantly enhanced after two iterations. These results highlight the advantage of our approach, and facilitate the implementation of complex quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Key Distribution using Decoy Pulses to Combat Photon-Number Splitting by Eavesdropper: An Event-by-Event Impairment Enumeration Approach for Performance Evaluation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-key distribution (QKD) schemes employing quantum communication links are typically based on the transmission of weak optical pulses over optical fibers to setup a secret key between the transmitting and receiving nodes. Alice transmits optically a random bit stream to the receiver (Bob) through the photon polarizations or the quadrature components of the lightwaves associated with the photons, with a secret key remaining implicitly embedded therein. However, during the above transmission, some eavesdropper (Eve) might attempt to tap the passing-by photons from the optical fiber links to extract the key. In one of the popular QKD schemes, along with signal pulses, some additional decoy pulses are transmitted by Alice, while Eve might use photon-number splitting (PNS) for eavesdropping. In a typical PNS scheme, (i) the optical pulses with single photon are blocked by Eve, (ii) from the optical pulses with two photons, one photon is retained by Eve to carry out eavesdropping operation and the other is retransmitted to Bob, and (iii) all other pulses with more than two photons are retransmitted by Eve to Bob without retaining any photon from them. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out on such QKD schemes, by employing information-theoretic approach along with computer simulations and experimental studies. We present a novel event-by-event impairment enumeration approach to evaluate the overall performance of one such QKD scheme analytically with due consideration to the physical layer of the quantum communication links. The proposed approach monitors the impairments of the propagating optical pulses event-by-event at all possible locations along the optical fiber link using statistical approach, and provides estimates of the realizable key generation rate, while assuring an adequate yield ratio between signal and decoy pulses for the detection of possible eavesdropping.</description>

      <title>Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate is a two-qubit controlled-phase gate in ion traps that is highly valued due to its ability to preserve the motional state of the ions. However, its fidelity is obstructed by errors affecting the motion of the ions as well as the rotation of the qubits. In this work, we propose an amplitude-modulated composite MS gate which features high fidelity robust to gate timing, detuning and coupling errors.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Equilibrium Topological Order on a Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], that are generically difficult to simulate classically due to their high entanglement. Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref. [6], image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes, and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.</description>

      <title>The Floquet central spin model: A platform to realize eternal time crystals, entanglement steering, and multiparameter metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and characterize protocols to realize eternal discrete time crystals (DTCs) in the periodically driven central spin model. These eternal DTCs exhibit perfect periodic revivals of the initial state at a time $mnT$ (where $n&gt;1$ and $\{m,n\} \in \mathbb{Z}$), when the Ising interaction strength, $\lambda$ between the central spin and the satellite spins is tuned to certain values. The combination of perfect initial-state revival and time-translation-symmetry breaking leads to infinitely long-lived oscillations of the stroboscopic magnetization and the entanglement entropy in these DTCs even for a finite number of satellite spins. We analytically determine the conditions for the existence of these eternal DTCs and prove that the system exhibits eternal period-doubling oscillations ($n=2$) when $\lambda = 2 \pi$ for an arbitrary number of satellite spins. Furthermore, we propose a protocol to realize eternal higher-order(HO)-DTCs ($n&gt;2$) by tuning $\lambda$ to $\pi$. Intriguingly, this protocol naturally steers the system through an entangled trajectory, thereby leading to the generation of maximally entangled Bell-cat states during the dynamical evolution of the HO-DTC. Finally, we demonstrate that these HO-DTCs can serve as a resource for Heisenberg-limited multiparameter sensing.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics in isolated quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is believed that an isolated quantum many-body system far away from equilibrium should try to attain equilibrium via a mechanism whereby any given subsystem acts as an open quantum system that is coupled to an environment which is the complementary part of the full system and undergoing a complicated equilibration process such that all the subsystems in the long-time limit attain equilibrium states compatible with the global equilibrium state. This picture begs the question whether the dynamics of any given subsystem is Markovian (monotonic loss of information and memory) or non-Markovian. In this work, by numerically probing the dynamical behaviour of the distance between \textit{temporally-separated} subsystem states, we reveal the telltale signatures and other associated features of quantum (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics of small subsystems of an isolated quantum spin system in one dimension (the Ising spin chain) brought far from equilibrium by quantum quenches. Additionally, remarkably systematic behaviour is seen in the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the subsystems. These features strongly depend on the direction of quenching in the parameter space, with paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic quenches offering considerably stronger signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity, for which we offer heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in fermionic two-body continuous-time quantum walk under the steepest entropy ascent formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks play a crucial role in quantum algorithms and computational problems. Many-body quantum walks can reveal and exploit quantum correlations that are unavailable for single-walker cases. Studying quantum walks under noise and dissipation, particularly in multi-walker systems, has significant implications. In this context, we use a thermodynamically consistent formalism of dissipation modeling, namely the steepest entropy ascent (SEA) formalism. We analyze two spinless fermionic continuous-time walkers on a 1D graph with tunable Hubbard and extended Hubbard-like interactions. By contrasting SEA-driven dynamics with unitary evolution, we systematically investigate how interaction strengths modulate thermalization and entropy production. Our findings highlight the relevance of SEA formalism in modeling nonlinear dissipation in many-body quantum systems and its implications for quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Expectation Values via Exponential Error Suppression and CVaR Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise quantum expectation values are crucial for quantum algorithm development, but noise in real-world systems can degrade these estimations. While quantum error correction is resource-intensive, error mitigation strategies offer a practical alternative. This paper presents a framework that combines Virtual Channel Purification (VCP) technique with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization to improve expectation value estimations in noisy quantum circuits. Our contributions are twofold: first, we derive conditions to compare CVaR values from different probability distributions, offering insights into the reliability of quantum estimations under noise. Second, we apply this framework to VCP, providing analytical bounds that establish its effectiveness in improving expectation values, both when the overhead VCP circuit is ideal (error-free) and when it adds additional noise. By introducing CVaR into the analysis of VCP, we offer a general noise-characterization method that guarantees improved expectation values for any quantum observable. We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach with numerical examples, highlighting how our bounds guide VCP implementation in noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian dynamics simulation using linear combination of unitaries on an ion trap quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear combination of unitaries (LCU) method has proven to scale better than existing product formulas in simulating long time Hamiltonian dynamics. However, given the number of multi-control gate operations in the standard prepare-select-unprepare architecture of LCU, it is still resource-intensive to implement on the current quantum computers. In this work, we demonstrate LCU implementations on an ion trap quantum computer for calculating squared overlaps $|\langle \psi(t=0)|\psi(t&gt;0)\rangle|^2$ of time-evolved states. This is achieved by an optimized LCU method, based on pre-selecting relevant unitaries, coupled with a compilation strategy which makes use of quantum multiplexor gates, leading to a significant reduction in the depth and number of two-qubit gates in circuits. For $L$ Pauli strings in a $n$-qubit-mapped Hamiltonian, we find a two-qubit gate count of $2^{\lceil log_2(L)\rceil}(2n+1)-n-2$. We test this approach by simulating a Rabi-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise quantum control relies on a deep understanding of the dynamics of quantum systems under external drives. This study investigates the impact of anharmonicity on qubit dynamics under conditions typical for two-qubit entangling gates activated by weak near-resonant microwave drives. We measure the Rabi oscillation frequency as a function of drive amplitude and detuning. Our results reveal a linear dependence of the squared Rabi frequency on the squared drive amplitude, which relates to the ratio of detuning to anharmonicity, demonstrating strong agreement between experimental data and analytical predictions. Additionally, we analyze the leakage and phase errors arising from inaccurate Rabi frequency adjustments in the CZ gate implementation on fluxonium qubits driven by a microwave signal applied to the coupler.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulations of the Non-Resonant Open Tavis-Cummings Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open Tavis-Cummings model consists of $N$ quantum emitters interacting with a common cavity mode, accounts for losses and decoherence, and is frequently explored for quantum information processing and designing quantum devices. As $N$ increases, it becomes harder to simulate the open Tavis-Cummings model using traditional methods. To address this problem, we implement two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of this model in the inhomogenous, non-resonant regime, with up to three excitations in the cavity. We show that the implemented algorithms have gate complexities that scale polynomially, as $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$. One of these algorithms is the sampling-based wave matrix Lindbladization algorithm, for which we propose two protocols to implement its system-independent fixed interaction, resolving key open questions of [Patel and Wilde, Open Sys. &amp; Info. Dyn., 30:2350014 (2023)]. Furthermore, we benchmark our results against a classical differential equation solver and demonstrate the ability to simulate classically intractable systems.</description>

      <title>Sample Classification using Machine Learning-Assisted Entangled Two-Photon Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled two-photon absorption (eTPA) has been recognized as a potentially powerful tool for the implementation of ultra-sensitive spectroscopy. Unfortunately, there exists a general agreement in the quantum optics community that experimental eTPA signals, particularly those obtained from molecular solutions, are extremely weak. Consequently, obtaining spectroscopic information about an arbitrary sample via conventional methods rapidly becomes an unrealistic endeavor. To address this problem, we introduce an experimental scheme that reduces the amount of data needed to identify and classify unknown samples via their electronic structure. Our proposed method makes use of machine learning (ML) to extract information about the number of intermediate levels that participate in the two-photon excitation of the absorbing medium. This is achieved by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with various eTPA signals where the delay between the absorbed photons is externally controlled. Inspired by multiple experimental studies of eTPA, we consider model systems comprising one to four intermediate levels, whose energies are randomly chosen from four different intermediate-level band gaps, namely: $\Delta\lambda = 10$, $20$, $30$, and $40$ nm. Within these band gaps, and with the goal of testing the efficiency of our artificial intelligence algorithms, we make use of three different wavelength spacing $1$, $0.5$ and $0.1$ nm. We find that for a proper entanglement time between the absorbed photons, classification average efficiencies exceed 99$\%$ for all configurations. Our results demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks for facilitating the experimental implementation of eTPA spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Mitigating shot noise in local overlapping quantum tomography with semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced density matrices (RDMs) are fundamental in quantum information processing, allowing the computation of local observables, such as energy and correlation functions, without the exponential complexity of fully characterizing quantum states. In the context of near-term quantum computing, RDMs provide sufficient information to effectively design variational quantum algorithms. However, their experimental estimation is challenging, as it involves preparing and measuring quantum states in multiple bases - a resource-intensive process susceptible to producing non-physical RDMs due to shot noise from limited measurements. To address this, we propose a method to mitigate shot noise by re-enforcing certain physicality constraints on RDMs. While verifying RDM compatibility with a global state is QMA-complete, we relax this condition by enforcing compatibility constraints up to a certain level using a polynomial-size semidefinite program to reconstruct overlapping RDMs from simulated experimental data. Our approach yields, on average, tighter bounds for the same number of measurements compared to tomography without compatibility constraints. We demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our method by integrating it into an algorithmic cooling procedure to prepare low-energy states of local Hamiltonians. Simulations on frustrated Hamiltonians reveal notable improvements in accuracy and resource efficiency, highlighting the potential of our approach for practical applications in near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Probing topological matter and fermion dynamics on a neutral-atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Singlet-only Always-on Gapless Exchange Qubits with Baseband Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Penrose-Wall singularity theorem in the full semiclassical gravity regime, significantly expanding its range of validity. To accomplish this, we modify the definition of quantum-trapped surfaces without affecting their genericity. Our theorem excludes controlled "bounces" in the interior of a black hole and in a large class of cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Theorems for Quantum Trajectories under Disordered Generalized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum trajectories arising from disordered, repeated generalized measurements, which have the structure of Markov chains in random environments (MCRE) with dynamically-defined transition probabilities; we call these disordered quantum trajectories. Under the assumption that the underlying disordered open quantum dynamical system approaches a unique equilibrium in time averages, we establish a strong law of large numbers for measurement outcomes arising from disordered quantum trajectories, which follows after we establish general annealed ergodic theorems for the corresponding MCRE. The type of disorder our model allows includes the random settings where the disorder is i.i.d. or Markovian, the periodic (resp. quasiperiodic) settings where the disorder has periodic (resp. quasiperiodic) structure, and the nonrandom setting where the disorder is constant through time. In particular, our work extends the earlier noise-free results of K\"ummerer and Maassen to the present disordered framework.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the decoherence of a quantum spatial superposition of a massive body created by an observer, Alice, that is subject to a short burst of gravitational radiation. We consider gravitational wave bursts with a simple oscillatory waveform and step-function memory waveform. Using a local description of the decoherence, we obtain an analytic estimate of the number of soft gravitons radiated by Alice's state. Moreover, we decompose her decoherence into contributions from the oscillatory and memory waveforms.
  We show that Alice's state decoheres proportional to the memory of the gravitational radiation she emits. To leading order, our calculation using a local description of the decoherence agrees with the decoherence caused by her radiating quadrupole. In general, the oscillatory contributions are strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work serves as a step towards understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity by demonstrating the role gravitational waves and the memory effect have in the loss of coherence of quantum superpositions. We also briefly investigate the electromagnetic analogue of this gedankenexperiment, in which Alice is subject to a burst of electromagnetic radiation, and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.</description>

      <title>Charge state tuning of spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network Toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems, including gauge theories, without encountering sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.</description>

      <title>A healthier stochastic semiclassical gravity: world without Schr\"{o}dinger cats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiclassical gravity couples classical gravity to the quantized matter in meanfield approximation. The meanfield coupling is problematic for two reasons. First, it ignores the quantum fluctuation of matter distribution. Second, it violates the linearity of the quantum dynamics. The first problem can be mitigated by allowing stochastic fluctuations of the geometry but the second problem lies deep in quantum foundations. Restoration of quantum linearity requires a conceptual approach to hybrid classical-quantum coupling. Studies of the measurement problem and the quantum-classical transition point to the solution. It is based on a postulated mechanism of spontaneous quantum monitoring plus feedback. This approach eliminates Schr\"{o}dinger cat states, takes quantum fluctuations into account, and restores the linearity of quantum dynamics. Such a captivating conceptionally `healthier' semiclassical theory exists in the Newtonian limit, but its relativistic covariance hits a wall. Here we will briefly recapitulate the concept and its realization in the nonrelativistic limit. We emphasize that the long-known obstacles to the relativistic extension lie in quantum foundations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reactions between pairs of atoms are ubiquitous processes in chemistry and physics. Quantum scattering effects on reactions often require extremely ultracold temperatures, approaching the $s$-wave regime, with a small number of partial waves involved. At higher temperatures, the different phases associated with the centrifugal barriers of different partial waves average out quantum interference to yield classical reaction rates. Here, we use quantum-logic to experimentally study resonant charge-exchange reactions between individual cold pairs of neutral $^{87}$Rb atoms and optically-inaccessible $^{87}$Rb$^{+}$ ions far above the $s$-wave regime. We find that the measured charge-exchange rate is significantly suppressed with respect to the classical prediction. Our results indicate that even at temperatures three orders of magnitude higher than the ultracold $s$-wave regime, quantum interference in collisions persists and impacts reaction rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextuality is a hallmark feature of the quantum theory that captures its incompatibility with any noncontextual hidden-variable model. The Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ)-type paradoxes are proofs of contextuality that reveal this incompatibility with deterministic logical arguments. However, the GHZ-type paradox whose events can be included in the fewest contexts and which brings the strongest nonclassicality remains elusive. Here, we derive a GHZ-type paradox with a context-cover number of three and show this number saturates the lower bound posed by quantum theory. We demonstrate the paradox with a time-domain fiber optical platform and recover the quantum prediction in a 37-dimensional setup based on high-speed modulation, convolution, and homodyne detection of time-multiplexed pulsed coherent light. By proposing and studying a strong form of contextuality in high-dimensional Hilbert space, our results pave the way for the exploration of exotic quantum correlations with time-multiplexed optical systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum work capacitances and maximal asymptotic work/energy ratios are figures of merit characterizing the robustness against noise of work extraction processes in quantum batteries formed by collections of quantum systems. In this paper we establish a direct connection between these functionals and, exploiting this result, we analyze different types of noise models mimicking self-discharging, thermalization and dephasing effects. In this context we show that input quantum coherence can significantly improve the storage performance of noisy quantum batteries and that the maximum output ergotropy is not always achieved by the maximum available input energy.</description>

      <title>Computing the gradients with respect to all parameters of a quantum neural network using a single circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding gradients is a crucial step in training machine learning models. For quantum neural networks, computing gradients using the parameter-shift rule requires calculating the cost function twice for each adjustable parameter in the network. When the total number of parameters is large, the quantum circuit must be repeatedly adjusted and executed, leading to significant computational overhead. Here we propose an approach to compute all gradients using a single circuit only, significantly reducing both the circuit depth and the number of classical registers required. We experimentally validate our approach on both quantum simulators and IBM's real quantum hardware, demonstrating that our method significantly reduces circuit compilation time compared to the conventional approach, resulting in a substantial speedup in total runtime.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Emulation of Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) are robust candidates for modelling and predicting future values in multivariate time series. However, the effective implementation of some QRNN models is limited by the need for mid-circuit measurements. Those increase the requirements for quantum hardware, which in the current NISQ era does not allow reliable computations. Emulation arises as the main near-term alternative to explore the potential of QRNNs, but existing quantum emulators are not dedicated to circuits with multiple intermediate measurements. In this context, we design a specific emulation method that relies on density matrix formalism. Using a compact tensor notation, we provide the mathematical formulation of the operator-sum representation involved. This allows us to show how the present and past information from a time series is transmitted through the circuit, and how to reduce the computational cost in every time step of the emulated network. In addition, we derive the analytical gradient and the Hessian of the network outputs with respect to its trainable parameters, which are needed when the outputs have stochastic noise due to hardware errors and a finite number of circuit shots (sampling). We finally test the presented methods using a hardware-efficient ansatz and four diverse datasets that include univariate and multivariate time series, with and without sampling noise. In addition, we compare the model with other existing quantum and classical approaches. Our results show how QRNNs can be trained with numerical and analytical gradients to make accurate predictions of future values by capturing non-trivial patterns of input series with different complexities.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Opposing Arrows of Time in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deriving an arrow of time from time-reversal symmetric microscopic dynamics is a fundamental open problem in many areas of physics, ranging from cosmology, to particle physics, to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Here we focus on the derivation of the arrow of time in open quantum systems and study precisely how time-reversal symmetry is broken. This derivation involves the Markov approximation applied to a system interacting with an infinite heat bath. We find that the Markov approximation does not imply a violation of time-reversal symmetry. Our results show instead that the time-reversal symmetry is maintained in the derived equations of motion. This imposes a time-symmetric formulation of quantum Brownian motion, Lindblad and Pauli master equations, which hence describe thermalisation that may occur into two opposing time directions. As a consequence, we argue that these dynamics are better described by a time-symmetric definition of Markovianity. Our results may reflect on the formulations of the arrow of time in thermodynamics, cosmology, and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of LQU and LQFI in general qubit-qutrit axially symmetric states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the compact closed forms of local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) for hybrid qubit-qutrit axially symmetric (AS) states. This allows us to study the quantum correlations in detail and present some essentially novel results for spin-(1/2, 1) systems, the Hamiltonian of which contains ten independent types of physically important parameters. As an application of the derived formulas, we study the behavior of these two quantum correlation measures at thermal equilibrium. New features are observed in their behavior that are important for quantum information processing. Specifically, cascades of sudden changes in the behavior of LQU and LQFI are found with a smooth change in temperature or interaction parameters. Interestingly, in some cases, sudden transitions are observed in the behavior of LQU but not in LQFI, and vice versa. Moreover, our compact formulas open a way to apply them to other problems, for instance, when investigating the environmental effects on quantum correlations in open systems.</description>

      <title>High-rate quantum LDPC codes for long-range-connected neutral atom registers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes with moderate overheads in qubit number and control complexity are highly desirable for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recently, quantum error correction has experienced significant progress both in code development and experimental realizations, with neutral atom qubit architecture rapidly establishing itself as a leading platform in the field. Scalable quantum computing will require processing with QEC codes that have low qubit overhead and large error suppression, and while such codes do exist, they involve a degree of non-locality that has yet to be integrated into experimental platforms. In this work, we analyze a family of high-rate Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes with limited long-range interactions and outline a near-term implementation in neutral atom registers. By means of circuit-level simulations, we find that these codes outperform surface codes in all respects when the two-qubit nearest neighbour gate error probability is below $\sim 0.1\%$. By using multiple laser colors, we show how these codes can be natively integrated in two-dimensional static neutral atom qubit architectures with open boundaries, where the desired long-range connectivity can be targeted via the Rydberg blockade interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Origin of Limit Cycles, Fixed Points, and Critical Slowing Down</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Yang-Lee theory in quantum phase transitions from the perspective of quantum entanglement in one-dimensional many-body systems. We primarily focus on the distribution of Yang-Lee zeros and its associated Yang-Lee edge singularity of two prototypical models: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the \emph{XXZ} spin chain. By taking the zero-temperature limit, we show how the Yang-Lee zeros approach the quantum phase transition points on the complex plane of parameters. To characterize the edge singularity induced by Yang-Lee zeros in quantum phase transition, we introduce the entanglement entropy of the ground state to show that the edges of Yang-Lee zeros lead to the ground-state entanglement transition. We further show that our results are also applicable to the general non-interacting parity-time-symmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for partial differential equations of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial for modeling various physical phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid flow, and electromagnetic waves. In computer-aided engineering (CAE), the ability to handle fine resolutions and large computational models is essential for improving product performance and reducing development costs. However, solving large-scale PDEs, particularly for systems with spatially varying material properties, poses significant computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving second-order linear PDEs of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters, using the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method. Our approach transforms those PDEs into ordinary differential equations represented by qubit operators, through spatial discretization using the finite difference method. Then, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs the operator corresponding to the spatially varying parameters of PDEs via a logic minimization technique, which reduces the number of terms and subsequently the circuit depth. We also develop a scalable method for realizing a quantum circuit for LCHS, using a tensor-network-based technique, specifically a matrix product state (MPS). We validate our method with applications to the acoustic equation with spatially varying parameters and the dissipative heat equation. Our approach includes a detailed recipe for constructing quantum circuits for PDEs, leveraging efficient encoding of spatially varying parameters of PDEs and scalable implementation of LCHS, which we believe marks a significant step towards advancing quantum computing's role in solving practical engineering problems.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanics postulate called the Born Rule attributes a probabilistic meaning to a wave function. This paper derives the Born Rule from other quantum principles along with a model of the measurement process.
  The nondeterministic nature of quantum measurements is hypothesized to arise from an ignorance of the quantum states of a measuring device's microscopic components. Their interactions with a system to be measured are modeled heuristically with any member of a particular class of stochastic processes, each of which generate the Born Rule. One member of the class appears particularly compatible with properties expected of quantum interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the quantum information resources within bipartite pure and mixed states of the quantum spin-1 Heisenberg dimer system, considering some interesting factors such as the $l_{1}$-norm of quantum coherence, relative coherence, negativity, and steering, influenced by the magnetic field and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy. Through a thorough investigation, we derive the system's density operator at thermal equilibrium and establish a mathematical framework for analyzing quantum resource metrics. Our results unveil the system's behavior at absolute zero temperature. We further observe temperature's role in transitioning the system towards classical states, impacting coherence, entanglement, and steering differently. Notably, we find that increasing the exchange anisotropy parameter can reinforce quantum correlations while adjusting the uniaxial single-ion anisotropy influences the system's quantumness, particularly when it is positive. Some recommendations to maximize quantum coherence, entanglement, and steering involve temperature reduction, increasing the exchange anisotropy parameter, and carefully managing the magnetic field and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy parameter, highlighting the intricate interplay between these factors in maintaining the system's quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Preparing Ground and Excited States Using Adiabatic CoVaR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CoVarince Root finding with classical shadows (CoVaR) was recently introduced as a new paradigm for training variational quantum circuits. Common approaches, such as variants of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, aim to optimise a non-linear classical cost function and thus suffer from, e.g., poor local minima, high shot requirements and barren plateaus. In contrast, CoVaR fully exploits powerful classical shadows and finds joint roots of a very large number of covariances using only a logarithmic number of shots and linearly scaling classical computing resources. As a result, CoVaR has been demonstrated to be particularly robust against local traps, however, its main limitation has been that it requires a sufficiently good initial state. We address this limitation by introducing an adiabatic morphing of the target Hamiltonian and demonstrate in a broad range of application examples that CoVaR can successfully prepare eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian when no initial warm start is known. CoVaR succeeds even when Hamiltonian energy gaps are very small -- this is in stark contrast to adiabatic evolution and phase estimation algorithms where circuit depths scale inversely with the Hamiltonian energy gaps. On the other hand, when the energy gaps are relatively small then adiabatic CoVaR may converge to higher excited states as opposed to a targeted specific low-lying state. Nevertheless, we exploit this feature of adiabatic CoVaR and demonstrate that it can be used to map out the low lying spectrum of a Hamiltonian which can be useful in practical applications, such as estimating thermal properties or in high-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce semidefinite programming hierarchies for benchmarking relevant entanglement properties in the high-dimensional steering scenario. Firstly, we provide a general method for detecting the entanglement dimensionality through certification of the Schmidt number. Its key feature is that the computational cost is independent of the Schmidt number under consideration. Secondly, we provide a method to estimate the fidelity of the source with any maximally entangled state. Using only basic computational means, we demonstrate the usefulness of these methods, which can be directly used to analyse experiments on high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation in its current state faces experimental overhead in terms of physical space and cooling. We propose boson sampling as an alternative compact synthetic platform performing at room temperature. Identifying the capability of estimating matrix permanents, we explore the applicability of boson sampling for tackling the dynamics of quantum systems without having access to information about the full state vector. By mapping the time-evolution unitary of a Hamiltonian onto an interferometer via continuous-variable gate decompositions, we present proof-of-principle results of localization characteristics of a single particle. We study the dynamics of one-dimensional tight-binding systems in the clean and quasiperiodic-disordered limits to observe Bloch oscillations and dynamical localization, and the delocalization-to-localization phase transition in the Aubry- Andre-Harper model respectively. Our computational results obtained using boson sampling are in complete agreement with the dynamical and static results of non-interacting tight-binding systems obtained using conventional numerical calculations. Additionally, our study highlights the role of number of sampling measurements or shots for simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the generic problem of optimal quantum state preparation for open quantum systems. It is well known that open quantum systems can be simulated by quantum trajectories described by a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. In this context, the state preparation becomes a stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem. The latter requires the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is, in general, challenging to solve. A notable exception are the so-called path integral (PI) control problems, for which one can estimate the optimal control solution by direct sampling of the cost objective. In this work, we derive a class of quantum state preparation problems that are amenable to PI control techniques, and propose a corresponding algorithm, which we call Quantum Diffusion Control (QDC). Unlike conventional quantum control algorithms, QDC avoids computing gradients of the cost function to determine the optimal control. Instead, it employs adaptive importance sampling, a technique where the controls are iteratively improved based on global averages over quantum trajectories. We also demonstrate that QDC, used as an annealer in the environmental coupling strength, finds high accuracy solutions for unitary (noiseless) quantum control problems. We further discuss the implementation of this technique on quantum hardware. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples of open-loop control for single- and multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>The quantum magic of fermionic Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of magic in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in magic at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Geometric monotones of violations of quantum realism</title>

Abstract: Quantum realism, as introduced by Bilobran and Angelo [EPL 112, 40005 (2015)], states that projective measurements in quantum systems establish the reality of physical properties, even in the absence of a revealed outcome. This framework provides a nuanced perspective on the distinction between classical and quantum notions of realism, emphasizing the contextuality and complementarity inherent to quantum systems. While prior works have quantified violations of quantum realism (VQR) using measures based on entropic distances, here we extend the theoretical framework to geometric distances. Building on an informational approach, we derive geometric monotones of VQR using trace distance, Hilbert-Schmidt distance, Schatten $p$-distances, Bures, and Hellinger distances. We identify Bures and Hellinger distances as uniquely satisfying all minimal criteria for a bona fide VQR monotone. Remarkably, these distances can be expressed in terms of symmetric R\'enyi and Sandwiched R\'enyi divergences, aligning geometric and entropic approaches. Our findings suggest that the realism-information relation implies a deep connection between geometric and entropic frameworks, with only those geometric distances expressible as entropic quantities qualifying as valid monotones of VQR. This work highlights the theoretical and practical advantages of geometric distances, particularly in contexts where computational simplicity or symmetry is important.</description>

      <title>TorchQC -- A framework for efficiently integrating machine and deep learning methods in quantum dynamics and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has been revolutionizing our world over the last few years and is also increasingly exploited in several areas of physics, including quantum dynamics and control.The need for a framework that brings together machine learning models and quantum simulation methods has been quite high within the quantum control field, with the ultimate goal of exploiting these powerful computational methods for the efficient implementation of modern quantum technologies. The existing frameworks for quantum system simulations, such as QuTip and QuantumOptics.jl, even though they are very successful in simulating quantum dynamics, cannot be easily incorporated into the platforms used for the development of machine learning models, like for example PyTorch. The TorchQC framework introduced in the present work comes exactly to fill this gap. It is a new library written entirely in Python and based on the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks are based on tensors, a structure that is also used in quantum mechanics. This is the common ground that TorchQC utilizes to combine quantum physics simulations and deep learning models.TorchQC exploits PyTorch and its tensor mechanism to represent quantum states and operators as tensors, while it also incorporates all the tools needed to simulate quantum system dynamics. All necessary operations are internal in the PyTorch library, thus TorchQC programs can be executed in GPUs, substantially reducing the simulation time. We believe that the proposed TorchQC library has the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning models directly incorporating quantum simulations, enabling the easier integration of these powerful techniques in modern quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction Without Encoding via the Circulant Structure of Pauli Noise and the Fast Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates distribution error correction (DEC) theory, where we correct the output distribution of a quantum computer to the ideal distribution exactly. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel, the ideal output distribution and noisy distribution in the standard basis are related by a stochastic matrix. We prove that this matrix has a recursive 2 by 2 block circulant structure. Thus, the noisy output distribution can be corrected to the ideal output distribution via a Fast Fourier Transform. Therefore, DEC for Pauli error channels does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more physical qubits and it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum error correction codes. Moreover, we introduce a DEC implementation that requires executions of only 2 logical circuits. The approach is tested with quantum hardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, 5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum phase estimation, and 10-qubit and 20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits. The correction process dramatically improves the accuracies of the output distributions for all demonstrations. For 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, a corrected distribution fidelity of 97.7% is achieved from an initial raw fidelity of 23.2%.</description>

Abstract: We present a general method for the implementation of quantum algorithms that optimizes both gate count and circuit depth. Our approach introduces connectivity-adapted CNOT-based building blocks called Parity Twine chains. It outperforms all known state-of-the art methods for implementing prominent quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform or the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm across a wide range of quantum hardware, including linear, square-grid, hexagonal, ladder and all-to-all connected devices. For specific cases, we rigorously prove the optimality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Activation During Open Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fact that in the course of an open evolution there is, in a vast majority of cases, a creation of system-environment entanglement out of the initial coherences, has been known for many years. However, how much entanglement can be created under general assumptions has not been analyzed yet. In this work, we investigate system-environment entanglement generation under a broad and important class of interactions known as pure dephasing interactions. Using completely general initials states, we derive a series of bounds on the amount of the created entanglement, connecting it to the initial system coherences as well as to the decohrence strength, making quantitatively precise the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence. Interestingly, we obtain lower bounds, certifying minimal amount of entanglement that can be produced. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing time evolution of the entanglement and the Markovian/non-Markovian crossover. Our results help to better understand and quantify the complicated correlations, produced during an open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better/new decoherence mitigation techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Simulating methylamine using symmetry adapted qubit-excitation-based variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the resources that are needed to simulate certain molecules on a medium-scale quantum computer with the use of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach. As the conventional realization of the VQE approach significant amount of resources for simulation, we propose and analyze optimization techniques based on molecular point group symmetries (symmetry adaption) and compact excitation circuits (qubit-excitation-based). These optimizations allows significant reduction of the essential computational capabilities yet ensuring the convergence to the required energies. We first apply this approach for small molecules, such as LiH and BeH$_2$, to evaluate their compatibility, accuracy, and potential applicability to larger problems. Then we demonstrate that instead of 600,000 two-qubit operations (in the STO-3G basis using a naive version of the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz), we are able to simulate methylamine molecules with 26 qubits and about 12,000 of two-qubit gates using our method. We accomplish our analysis by estimating required resources for a formic acid molecule, whose simulation requires about 15,000 of two-qubit gates. Thus, the proposed combination of certain optimization methods can reduce the number of two-qubit operations by several orders of magnitude.Although, we present alternative approaches that are of interest in the context of the further optimization in the number of two-qubit operation, we note that these approaches do not perform well enough in terms of the convergence to required energies. While these challenges persist, our resource analysis represents a valuable step towards the practical use of quantum computers and the development of better methods for optimizing computing resources.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a topological exciton insulator with tunable momentum order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant, both in R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>
