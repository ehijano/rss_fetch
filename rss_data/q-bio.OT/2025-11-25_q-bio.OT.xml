      <title>Assessing Gaze and Pointing: Human Cue Interpretation by Indian Free-Ranging Dogs in a Food Retrieval Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urban habitat provides a landscape that increases the chances of human-animal interactions, which can lead to increased human-animal conflict, but also coexistence. Some species show high levels of socio-cognitive abilities that enable them to perceive communicational gestures of humans and use them for their own benefit. This study investigated the ability of Indian free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) to utilise human social-referential cues (pointing and gazing) to locate hidden food, focusing on the relative effectiveness of unimodal versus multimodal cues. A total of 352 adult free-ranging dogs were tested in an object-choice task involving six different cue conditions: control (no cue), negative control (one baited bowl, no cue), combined pointing and gazing, pointing-only, gazing-only, and conflicting cues (pointing and gazing at opposite bowls). The dogs successfully chose the correct target only in the combined pointing and gazing condition, while performance under unimodal and conflicting cue conditions did not differ significantly from chance. This highlights the importance of signal redundancy and clarity in interspecific communication for this population. A dog's demeanor was a significant predictor of its willingness to engage: affiliative dogs were significantly more likely to succeed in the overall experiment and displayed a significantly shorter approach latency compared to anxious and neutral dogs. While demeanor affected the approach latency, it did not affect the accuracy of the choice, decoupling the dogs' personality from its cognitive ability to comprehend the clear cue. Neither the dogs' sex nor the experimental condition significantly predicted approach latency.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Biomedicine: A Survey of Technologies, Datasets, and Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their application in the biomedical domain presents unique challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy and up-to-date knowledge integration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge retrieval. This comprehensive survey examines the application of RAG in the biomedical domain, focusing on its technological components, available datasets, and clinical applications. We present a systematic analysis of retrieval methods, ranking strategies, and generation models, while also exploring the challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. Our work provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the current state of biomedical RAG systems and identifies key areas for future research and development.</description>
