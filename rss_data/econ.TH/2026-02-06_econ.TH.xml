      <title>Aspiration-Weighted Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study directed social influence when an influencer chooses from a richer menu than a constrained follower (decision maker, the DM). The DM selects from a feasible set, while the influencer displays a distribution over a superset that includes infeasible alternatives. We propose the Aspiration-Weighted Luce Model (AWLM): the DM forms a convex combination of her idiosyncratic Luce preferences within the feasible set and the influencer's distribution, then renormalizes this attempt target onto the feasible set. This renormalization generates an aspirational dampening effect: holding the influencer's within-feasible composition fixed and shifting exposure toward infeasible alternatives attenuates influence on feasible choices. We provide an axiomatic characterization based on proportional responses to shifts in feasible exposure and a unit-slope leverage restriction across different levels of feasible share. The model allows for point identification of influence strength and idiosyncratic preferences from two exposure regimes, yielding testable overidentifying restrictions for empirical application.</description>

      <title>A new proof of Smithson's fixed point theorem for order preserving multifunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15483v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixed point theorems are ubiquitous in economic research. Many studies cite Smithson (1971) ``Fixed points of order preserving multifunctions,'' yet the original proof contains errors. This note presents a new, concise proof and explains why Smithson's argument is invalid.</description>

      <title>Learning and Communication Towards Unanimous Consent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A principal and an agent can launch a project under unanimous consent. Their individual payoffs from the project depend on an underlying state, and the agent privately knows his own preference. The principal can conduct a test to learn about the state and then communicate with the agent, but has limited commitment, as she may misreport her findings. We show that limited commitment makes binary tests optimal. Moreover, when players' preferences are positively aligned, the optimal test is a threshold test. When their preferences are negatively aligned, the optimal test is either an interval test or a tail test, depending on the agent's relative risk attitude. Additionally, the principal can benefit from screening the agent through a menu of tests, which admits a simple structure regardless of the complexity of the agent's type space.</description>

      <title>Broad Validity of the First-Order Approach in Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the standard moral hazard problem with limited liability. The first-order approach (FOA) is the main tool for its solution, but existing sufficient conditions for its validity are restrictive. Our main result shows that the FOA is broadly valid, as long as the agent's reservation utility is sufficiently high. In basic examples, the FOA is valid for almost any positive reservation wage.
  We establish existence and uniqueness of the optimal contract. We derive closed-form solutions with various functional forms. We show that optimal contracts are either linear or piecewise linear option contracts with log utility and output distributions in an exponential family with linear sufficient statistic (including Gaussian, exponential, binomial, geometric, and Gamma). We provide an algorithm for finding the optimal contracts both in the case where the FOA is valid and in the case where it is not at trivial computational cost.</description>
