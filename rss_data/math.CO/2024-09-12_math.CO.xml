      <title>Chromatic Ramsey numbers and two-color Tur\'{a}n densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, its $2$-color Tur\'{a}n number $\mathrm{ex}^{(2)}(n,G)$ is the largest number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph whose edges can be colored with two colors avoiding a monochromatic copy of $G$. Let $\pi^{(2)}(G)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathrm{ex}^{(2)}(n,G)/\binom{n}{2}$ be the $2$-color Tur\'{a}n density of $G$. What real numbers in the interval $(0,1)$ are realized as the $2$-color Tur\'{a}n density of some graph? It is known that $\pi^{(2)}(G)=1-(R_{\chi}(G)-1)^{-1}$, where $R_{\chi}(G)$ is the chromatic Ramsey number of $G$. However, determining specific values of $R_{\chi}(G)$ is challenging.
  Burr, Erd\H{o}s, and Lov\'{a}sz showed that $(k-1)^2+1\leqslant{R_{\chi}(G)}\leqslant{R(k)}$, for any $k$-chromatic graph $G$, where $R(k)$ is the classical Ramsey number. The upper bound here can be attained by a clique and the lower bound is achieved by a graph constructed by Zhu. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other, besides these two, known values of $R_{\chi}(G)$ among $k$-chromatic graphs $G$ for general $k$. In this paper we prove that there are $\Omega(k)$ different values of $R_{\chi}(G)$ among $k$-chromatic graphs $G$. In addition, we determine a new value for the chromatic Ramsey numbers of $4$-chromatic graphs. This sheds more light into the possible $2$-color Tur\'{a}n densities of graphs.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for incidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ be a set of points in the unit square and let $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ be a set of $\delta$-tubes such that $T_j$ passes through $p_j$. We prove a lower bound for the number of incidences between the points and tubes under a natural regularity condition (similar to Frostman regularity). As a consequence, we show that in any configuration of points $p_1,\ldots, p_n \in [0,1]^2$ along with a line $\ell_j$ through each point $p_j$, there exist $j\neq k$ for which $d(p_j, \ell_k) \lesssim n^{-2/3+o(1)}$.
  It follows from the latter result that any set of $n$ points in the unit square contains three points forming a triangle of area at most $n^{-7/6+o(1)}$. This new upper bound for Heilbronn's triangle problem attains the high-low limit established in our previous work arXiv:2305.18253.</description>

      <title>Self-Reachable Configuration Polytopes for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lattice polytopes which arise as the convex hull of chip vectors for \textit{self-reachable} chip configurations on a tree $T$. We show that these polytopes always have the integer decomposition property and characterize the vertex sets of these polytopes. Additionally, in the case of self-reachable configurations with the smallest possible number of chips, we show that these polytopes are unimodularly equivalent to a unit cube.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on minimum size of feedback arc set of directed multigraphs with bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented multigraph is a directed multigraph without directed 2-cycles. Let ${\rm fas}(D)$ denote the minimum size of a feedback arc set in an oriented multigraph $D$. The degree of a vertex is the sum of its out- and in-degrees. In several papers, upper bounds for ${\rm fas}(D)$ were obtained for oriented multigraphs $D$ with maximum degree upper-bounded by a constant. Hanauer (2017) conjectured that ${\rm fas}(D)\le 2.5n/3$ for every oriented multigraph $D$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most 5. We prove a strengthening of the conjecture: ${\rm fas}(D)\le m/3$ holds for every oriented multigraph $D$ with $m$ arcs and maximum degree at most 5. This bound is tight and improves a bound of Berger and Shor (1990,1997). It would be interesting to determine $c$ such that ${\rm fas}(D)\le cn$ for every oriented multigraph $D$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most 5 such that the bound is tight. We show that $\frac{5}{7}\le c \le \frac{24}{29} &lt; \frac{2.5}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Basis sequence reconfiguration in the union of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and two spanning trees $T$ and $T'$ in $G$, Spanning Tree Reconfiguration asks whether there is a step-by-step transformation from $T$ to $T'$ such that all intermediates are also spanning trees of $G$, by exchanging an edge in $T$ with an edge outside $T$ at a single step. This problem is naturally related to matroid theory, which shows that there always exists such a transformation for any pair of $T$ and $T'$. Motivated by this example, we study the problem of transforming a sequence of spanning trees into another sequence of spanning trees. We formulate this problem in the language of matroid theory: Given two sequences of bases of matroids, the goal is to decide whether there is a transformation between these sequences. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, even if the matroids are given as basis oracles. To complement this algorithmic result, we show that the problem of finding a shortest transformation is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $c \log n$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, where $n$ is the total size of the ground sets of the input matroids.</description>

      <title>An inverse theorem for the Gowers $U^3$-norm relative to quadratic level sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an effective version of the inverse theorem for the Gowers $U^3$-norm for functions supported on high-rank quadratic level sets in finite vector spaces. For configurations controlled by the $U^3$-norm (complexity-two configurations), this enables one to run a density increment argument with respect to quadratic level sets, which are analogues of Bohr sets in the context of quadratic Fourier analysis on finite vector spaces. We demonstrate such an argument by deriving an exponential bound on the Ramsey number of three-term progressions which are the same colour as their common difference (``Brauer quadruples''), a result we have been unable to establish by other means.
  Our methods also yield polylogarithmic bounds on the density of sets lacking translation-invariant configurations of complexity two. Such bounds for four-term progressions were obtained by Green and Tao using a simpler weak-regularity argument. In an appendix, we give an example of how to generalise Green and Tao's argument to other translation-invariant configurations of complexity two. However, this crucially relies on an estimate coming from the Croot-Lev-Pach polynomial method, which may not be applicable to all systems of complexity two. Hence running a density increment with respect to quadratic level sets may still prove useful for such problems. It may also serve as a model for running density increments on more general nil-Bohr sets, with a view to effectivising other Szemer\'edi-type theorems.</description>

      <title>On Christoffel words &amp; their lexicographic array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a Christoffel matrix we mean a $n\times n$ matrix corresponding to the lexicographic array of a Christoffel word of length $n.$ If $R$ is an integral domain, then the product of two Christoffel matrices over $R$ is commutative and is a Christoffel matrix over $R.$ Furthermore, if a Christoffel matrix over $R$ is invertible, then its inverse is a Christoffel matrix over $R.$ Consequently, the set $GC_n(R)$ of all $n\times n$ invertible Christoffel matrices over $R$ forms an abelian subgroup of $GL_n(R).$ The subset of $GC_n(R)$ consisting all invertible Christoffel matrices having some element $a$ on the diagonal and $b$ elsewhere (with $a,b \in R$ distinct) forms a subgroup $H$ of $GC_n(R).$ If $R$ is a field, then the quotient $GC_n(R)/H$ is isomorphic to $(\Z/nZ)^\times,$ the multiplicative group of integers modulo $n.$ It follows from this that for each finite field $F$ and each finite abelian group $G,$ there exists $n\geq 2$ and a faithful representation $G\rightarrow GL_n(F)$ consisting entirely of $n\times n$ (invertible) Christoffel matrices over $F.$ We find that $GC_n(\F_2) \simeq (\Z/nZ)^\times$ for $n$ odd and $GC_n(\F_2) \simeq \Z/2\Z \times (\Z/nZ)^\times$ for $n$ even. As an application, we define an associative and commutative binary operation on the set of all $\{0,1\}$-Christoffel words of length $n$ which in turn induces an associative and commutative binary operation on $\{0,1\}$-central words of length $n-2.$</description>

      <title>Interaction graphs of isomorphic automata networks II: universal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automata network with $n$ components over a finite alphabet $Q$ of size $q$ is a discrete dynamical system described by the successive iterations of a function $f:Q^n\to Q^n$. In most applications, the main parameter is the interaction graph of $f$: the digraph with vertex set $[n]$ that contains an arc from $j$ to $i$ if $f_i$ depends on input $j$. What can be said on the set $\mathbb{G}(f)$ of the interaction graphs of the automata networks isomorphic to $f$? It seems that this simple question has never been studied. In a previous paper, we prove that the complete digraph $K_n$, with $n^2$ arcs, is universal in that $K_n\in \mathbb{G}(f)$ whenever $f$ is not constant nor the identity (and $n\geq 5$). In this paper, taking the opposite direction, we prove that there exists universal automata networks $f$, in that $\mathbb{G}(f)$ contains all the digraphs on $[n]$, excepted the empty one. Actually, we prove that the presence of only three specific digraphs in $\mathbb{G}(f)$ implies the universality of $f$, and we prove that this forces the alphabet size $q$ to have at least $n$ prime factors (with multiplicity). However, we prove that for any fixed $q\geq 3$, there exists almost universal functions, that is, functions $f:Q^n\to Q^n$ such that the probability that a random digraph belongs to $\mathbb{G}(f)$ tends to $1$ as $n\to\infty$. We do not know if this holds in the binary case $q=2$, providing only partial results.</description>

      <title>Infinite log-concavity and higher order Tur\'{a}n inequality for Speyer's $g$-polynomial of uniform matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U_{n,d}$ be the uniform matroid of rank $d$ on $n$ elements. Denote by $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ the Speyer's $g$-polynomial of $U_{n,d}$. The Tur\'{a}n inequality and higher order Tur\'{a}n inequality are related to the Laguerre-P\'{o}lya ($\mathcal{L}$-$\mathcal{P}$) class of real entire functions, and the $\mathcal{L}$-$\mathcal{P}$ class has close relation with the Riemann hypothesis. The Tur\'{a}n type inequalities have received much attention. Infinite log-concavity is also a deep generalization of Tur\'{a}n inequality with different direction. In this paper, we mainly obtain the infinite log-concavity and the higher order Tur\'{a}n inequality of the sequence $\{g_{U_{n,d}}(t)\}_{d=1}^{n-1}$ for $t&gt;0$. In order to prove these results, we show that the generating function of $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$, denoted $h_n(x;t)$, has only real zeros for $t&gt;0$. Consequently, for $t&gt;0$, we also obtain the $\gamma$-positivity of the polynomial $h_n(x;t)$, the asymptotical normality of $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$, and the Laguerre inequalities for $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ and $h_n(x;t)$.</description>

      <title>Submodular functions, generalized permutahedra, conforming preorders, and cointeracting bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a submodular function we define a class of preorders, conforming preorders. A submodular function $z$ corresponds to a generalized permutahedron $\Pi(z)$. We show the faces of $\Pi(z)$ are in bijection with the conforming preorders. The face poset structure of $\Pi(z)$ induces two order relations $\lhd$ and $\blacktriangleleft$ on conforming preorder, and we investigate their properties.
  Ardila and Aguiar introduced a Hopf monoid of submodular functions/generalized permutahedra. We show there is a cointeracting bimonoid of modular functions. By recent theory of L.Foissy this associates a canonical polynomial to any submodular function.</description>

      <title>Multi-Virtual Knot Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a generalization of virtual knot theory that we call multi-virtual knot theory. Multi-virtual knot theory uses a multiplicity of types of virtual crossings. As we will explain, this multiplicity is motivated by the way it arises first in a graph-theoretic setting in relation to generalizing the Penrose evaluation for colorings of planar trivalent graphs to all trivalent graphs, and later by its uses in a virtual knot theory. As a consequence, the paper begins with the graph theory as a basis for our constructions, and then proceeds to the topology of multi-virtual knots and links. The second section of the paper is a review of our previous work (See arXiv:1511.06844). The reader interested in seeing our generalizations of the original Penrose evaluation, can begin this paper at the beginning and see the graph theory. A reader primarily interested in multi-virtual knots and links can begin reading in section 4 with references to the earlier part of the paper.</description>

Abstract: Let $p\ge 5$ be a prime and let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite symmetric group. To every irreducible character of $P$ we associate a collection of labelled, complete $p$-ary trees. The main results of this article describe Sylow branching coefficients for symmetric groups for all irreducible characters of $P$ in terms of some combinatorial properties of these trees, extending previous work on the linear characters of $P$.</description>

      <title>Limit Profile for the Bernoulli--Laplace Urn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the convergence to equilibrium of the Bernoulli--Laplace urn model: initially, one urn contains $k$ red balls and a second $n-k$ blue balls; in each step, a pair of balls is chosen uniform and their locations are switched. Cutoff is known to occur at $\tfrac12 n \log \min\{k, \sqrt n\}$ with window order $n$ whenever $1 \ll k \le \tfrac12 n$. We refine this by determining the limit profile: a function $\Phi$ such that \[
  d_\mathsf{TV}\bigl( \tfrac12 n \log \min\{k, \sqrt n\} + \theta n \bigr) \to
  \Phi(\theta) \quad\text{as}\quad
  n \to \infty \quad\text{for all}\quad
  \theta \in \mathbb R. \] Our main technical contribution, of independent interest, approximates a rescaled chain by a diffusion on $\mathbb R$ when $k \gg \sqrt n$, and uses its explicit law as a Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge encourages community approaches to developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data derived from social media, sensor feeds, and scientific data to discover relationships between events as they unfold in the field. The anonymized network sensing Graph Challenge seeks to enable large, open, community-based approaches to protecting networks. Many large-scale networking problems can only be solved with community access to very broad data sets with the highest regard for privacy and strong community buy-in. Such approaches often require community-based data sharing. In the broader networking community (commercial, federal, and academia) anonymized source-to-destination traffic matrices with standard data sharing agreements have emerged as a data product that can meet many of these requirements. This challenge provides an opportunity to highlight novel approaches for optimizing the construction and analysis of anonymized traffic matrices using over 100 billion network packets derived from the largest Internet telescope in the world (CAIDA). This challenge specifies the anonymization, construction, and analysis of these traffic matrices. A GraphBLAS reference implementation is provided, but the use of GraphBLAS is not required in this Graph Challenge. As with prior Graph Challenges the goal is to provide a well-defined context for demonstrating innovation. Graph Challenge participants are free to select (with accompanying explanation) the Graph Challenge elements that are appropriate for highlighting their innovations.</description>

      <title>Minimum non-chromatic-choosable graphs with given chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called chromatic-choosable if $\chi(G)=ch(G)$. A natural problem is to determine the minimum number of vertices in a $k$-chromatic non-$k$-choosable graph. It was conjectured by Ohba, and proved by Noel, Reed and Wu that $k$-chromatic graphs $G$ with $|V(G)| \le 2k+1$ are $k$-choosable. This upper bound on $|V(G)|$ is tight. It is known that if $k$ is even, then $G=K_{3 \star (k/2+1), 1 \star (k/2-1)}$ and $G=K_{4, 2 \star (k-1)}$ are $k$-chromatic graphs with $|V(G)| =2 k+2$ that are not $k$-choosable. Some subgraphs of these two graphs are also non-$k$-choosable. The main result of this paper is that all other $k$-chromatic graphs $G$ with $|V(G)| =2 k+2$ are $k$-choosable. In particular, if $\chi(G)$ is odd and $|V(G)| \le 2\chi(G)+2$, then $G$ is chromatic-choosable, which was conjectured by Noel.</description>

      <title>Dumont-Thomas complement numeration systems for $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the well-known Dumont--Thomas numeration systems to $\mathbb{Z}$ using an approach inspired by the two's complement numeration system. Integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ are canonically represented by a finite word (starting with $\mathtt{0}$ when nonnegative and with $\mathtt{1}$ when negative). The systems are based on two-sided periodic points of substitutions as opposed to the right-sided fixed points. For every periodic point of a substitution, we construct an automaton which returns the letter at position $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ of the periodic point when fed with the representation of $n$ in the corresponding numeration system. The numeration system naturally extends to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We give an equivalent characterization of the numeration system in terms of a total order on a regular language. Lastly, using particular periodic points, we recover the well-known two's complement numeration system and the Fibonacci analogue of the two's complement numeration system.</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation in strong products of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and assuming that some vertices of $G$ are infected, the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule makes an uninfected vertex $v$ infected if $v$ has at least $r$ infected neighbors. The $r$-percolation number, $m(G,r)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set of initially infected vertices in $G$ such that after continuously performing the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule each vertex of $G$ eventually becomes infected. In this paper, we consider percolation numbers of strong products of graphs. If $G$ is the strong product $G_1\boxtimes \cdots \boxtimes G_k$ of $k$ connected graphs, we prove that $m(G,r)=r$ as soon as $r\le 2^{k-1}$ and $|V(G)|\ge r$. As a dichotomy, we present a family of strong products of $k$ connected graphs with the $(2^{k-1}+1)$-percolation number arbitrarily large. We refine these results for strong products of graphs in which at least two factors have at least three vertices. In addition, when all factors $G_i$ have at least three vertices we prove that $m(G_1 \boxtimes \dots \boxtimes G_k,r)\leq 3^{k-1} -k$ for all $r\leq 2^k-1$, and we again get a dichotomy, since there exist families of strong products of $k$ graphs such that their $2^{k}$-percolation numbers are arbitrarily large. While $m(G\boxtimes H,3)=3$ if both $G$ and $H$ have at least three vertices, we also characterize the strong prisms $G\boxtimes K_2$ for which this equality holds. Some of the results naturally extend to infinite graphs, and we briefly consider percolation numbers of strong products of two-way infinite paths.</description>

      <title>Saturation results around the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider saturation problems related to the celebrated Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres convex polygon problem. For each $n \ge 7$, we construct a planar point set of size $(7/8) \cdot 2^{n-2}$ which is saturated for convex $n$-gons. That is, the set contains no $n$ points in convex position while the addition of any new point creates such a configuration. This demonstrates that the saturation number is smaller than the Ramsey number for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem. The proof also shows that the original Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres construction is indeed saturated.
  Our construction is based on a similar improvement for the saturation version of the cups-versus-caps theorem. Moreover, we consider the generalization of the cups-versus-caps theorem to monotone paths in ordered hypergraphs. In contrast to the geometric setting, we show that this abstract saturation number is always equal to the corresponding Ramsey number.</description>

Abstract: We describe the ordering of a class of clones by minion homomorphisms, also known as minor preserving maps or height 1 clone homomorphisms. The class consists of all clones on finite sets determined by binary relations whose projections to both coordinates have at most two elements. This class can be alternatively described up to minion homomorphisms as the class of multisorted Boolean clones determined by binary relations. We also introduce and apply the concept of a minion core which provides canonical representatives for equivalence classes of clones, more generally minions, on finite sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numbering $f$ of a graph $G$ of order $n$ is a labeling that assigns distinct elements of the set $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots ,n\right\} $ to the vertices of $G$, where each $uv\in E\left( G\right) $ is labeled $f\left( u\right) +f\left( v\right) $. The strength $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) $ of $G$ is defined by $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) =\min \left\{ \mathrm{str}_{f}\left( G\right) \left\vert f\text{ is a numbering of }G\right. \right\}$, where $\mathrm{str}_{f}\left( G\right) =\max \left\{ f\left( u\right) +f\left( v\right) \left\vert uv\in E\left( G\right) \right. \right\} $. Let $f\left( n\right) $ denote the maximum of $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) +% \mathrm{str}\left( \overline{G}\right) $ over nonempty graphs $G$ and $% \overline{G}$ of order $n$, where $\overline{G}$ represents the complement of $G$. In this paper, we establish a lower bound for the Ramsey numbers related to the concept of strength of a graph and show a sharp lower bound for $f\left( n\right) $. In addition to these results, we provide another lower bound and remark some exact values for $f\left( n\right) $. Furthermore, we extend existing necessary and sufficient conditions involving the strength of a graph. Finally, we investigate bounds for $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) +\mathrm{str}\left( \overline{G}\right) $ whenever $G$ and $\overline{G}$ are nonempty graphs of order $n$. Throughout this paper, we propose some open problems arising from our study.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we give a combinatorial model in terms of symmetric cores of the indexing set of the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ (the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in $\mathbb{C}^2$) containing a monomial ideal, whenever $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary dihedral group. Moreover, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group, to the binary octahedral group or to the binary icosahedral group, then the $\Gamma$-fixed points of $\mathcal{H}_n$ which are also fixed under $\mathbb{T}_1$, the maximal diagonal torus of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, are in fact $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-fixed points. Finally, we prove that in that case, the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ containing a $\mathbb{T}_1$-fixed point are of dimension $0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore properties of generalized Paley graphs and we extend a result of Lim and Praeger by providing a more precise description of the connected components of disconnected generalized Paley graphs. This result leads to a new characterization of when generalized Paley graphs are disconnected. We also provide necessary and sufficient divisibility conditions for the multiplicative group of the prime subfield of certain finite fields to be contained in the multiplicative subgroup of nonzero $k$-th powers. This latter result plays a crucial role in our development of a sorting algorithm on generalized Paley graphs that exploits the vector space structure of finite fields to partition certain subsets of vertices in a manner that decomposes the induced bipartite subgraph between them into complete balanced bipartite subgraphs. As a consequence, we establish a matching condition between these subsets of vertices that results in an explicit formula for the condensed Ricci curvature on certain Paley graphs and their generalizations.</description>

      <title>Toric degenerations of cluster varieties and cluster duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.08369v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a $Y$-pattern with coefficients and its geometric counterpart: a cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety with coefficients. We use these constructions to build a flat degeneration of every skew-symmetrizable specially completed cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety $\widehat{\mathcal{X}}$ to the toric variety associated to its $\mathbf{g}$-fan. Moreover, we show that the fibers of this family are stratified in a natural way, with strata the specially completed $\mathcal{X}$-varieties encoded by $\mathrm{Star}(\tau)$ for each cone $\tau$ of the $\mathbf{g}$-fan. These strata degenerate to the associated toric strata of the central fiber. We further show that the family is cluster dual to $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{prin}}$ of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, and the fibers cluster dual to $\mathcal{A}_t$. Finally, we give two applications. First, we use our construction to identify the Rietsch-Williams toric degeneration of Grassmannians with the Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich degeneration in the case of $\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^5)$. Next, we use it to link cluster duality to Batyrev-Borisov duality of Gorenstein toric Fanos in the context of mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Differential transcendence of Bell numbers and relatives: a Galois theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.15292v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2003 Klazar proved that the ordinary generating function of the sequence of Bell numbers is differentially transcendental over the field $\mathbb{C}(\{t\})$ of meromorphic functions at $0$. We show that Klazar's result is an instance of a general phenomenon that can be proven in a compact way using difference Galois theory. We present the main principles of this theory in order to prove a general result about differential transcendence over $\mathbb{C}(\{t\})$, that we apply to many other (infinite classes of) examples of generating functions, including as very special cases the ones considered by Klazar. Most of our examples belong to Sheffer's class, well studied notably in umbral calculus. They all bring concrete evidence in support to the Pak-Yeliussizov conjecture, according to which a sequence whose both ordinary and exponential generating functions satisfy nonlinear differential equations with polynomial coefficients necessarily satisfies a linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Continuous iterative algorithms for anti-Cheeger cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a judicious correspondence to the classical maxcut, the anti-Cheeger cut has more balanced structure, but few numerical results on it have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a continuous iterative algorithm (CIA) for the anti-Cheeger cut problem through fully using an equivalent continuous formulation. It does not need rounding at all and has advantages that all subproblems have explicit analytic solutions, the objective function values are monotonically updated and the iteration points converge to a local optimum in finite steps via an appropriate subgradient selection. It can also be easily combined with the maxcut iterations for breaking out of local optima and improving the solution quality thanks to the similarity between the anti-Cheeger cut problem and the maxcut problem. The performance of CIAs is fully demonstrated through numerical experiments on G-set from two aspects: one is on the solution quality where we find that the approximate solutions obtained by CIAs are of comparable quality to those by the multiple search operator heuristic method; the other is on the computational cost where we show that CIAs always run faster than the often-used continuous iterative algorithm based on the rank-two relaxation.</description>

      <title>The stochastic sandpile model on complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic sandpile model (SSM) is a generalisation of the standard Abelian sandpile model (ASM), in which topplings of unstable vertices are made random. When unstable, a vertex sends one grain to each of its neighbours independently with probability $p \in (0,1)$. We study the SSM on complete graphs. Our main result is a description of the recurrent states of the model. We show that these are given by convex sums of recurrent states for the ASM. This allows us to recover a well-known result: that the number of integer lattice points in the $n$-dimensional permutation polytope is equal to the number of labeled spanning forests on $n$ vertices. We also provide a stochastic version of Dhar's burning algorithm to check if a given (stable) state is recurrent or not, which runs in linear time. Finally, we study a family of so-called "partial" SSMs, in which some vertices topple randomly, while others topple deterministically (as in the ASM, sending one grain to all neighbours). We show that this distinction is meaningful, yielding sets of recurrent states that are in general different from those of both the ASM and SSM. We also show that to get all recurrent states of the SSM, we can allow up to two vertices to topple deterministically.</description>

      <title>A complete classification of shuffle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $k$ and $n$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ is generated by the $k!$ permutations of a deck of $kn$ cards performed by cutting the deck into $k$ piles with $n$ cards in each pile, and then perfectly interleaving these cards following a certain permutation of the $k$ piles. For $k=2$, the shuffle group $G_{2,2n}$ was determined by Diaconis, Graham and Kantor in 1983. The Shuffle Group Conjecture states that, for general $k$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ contains $\mathrm{A}_{kn}$ whenever $k\notin\{2,4\}$ and $n$ is not a power of $k$. In particular, the conjecture in the case $k=3$ was posed by Medvedoff and Morrison in 1987. The only values of $k$ for which the Shuffle Group Conjecture has been confirmed so far are powers of $2$, due to recent work of Amarra, Morgan and Praeger based on Classification of Finite Simple Groups. In this paper, we confirm the Shuffle Group Conjecture for all cases using results on $2$-transitive groups and elements of large fixed point ratio in primitive groups.</description>

      <title>Construction of CCC and ZCCS Through Additive Characters Over Galois Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progression in wireless communication technologies, especially in multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA), there is a need of advanced code construction methods. Traditional approaches, mainly based on generalized Boolean functions, have limitations in code length versatility. This paper introduces a novel approach to constructing complete complementary codes (CCC) and Z-complementary code sets (ZCCS), for reducing interference in MC-CDMA systems. The proposed construction, distinct from Boolean function-based approaches, employs additive characters over Galois fields GF($p^{r}$), where $p$ is prime and $r$ is a positive integer. First, we develop CCCs with lengths of $p^{r}$, which are then extended to construct ZCCS with both unreported lengths and sizes of $np^{r}$, where $n$ are arbitrary positive integers. The versatility of this method is further highlighted as it includes the lengths of ZCCS reported in prior studies as special cases, underscoring the method's comprehensive nature and superiority.</description>

      <title>A Szemer\'edi type theorem for sets of positive density in approximate lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extension of Szemer\'edi's Theorem is proved for sets of positive density in approximate lattices in general locally compact and second countable abelian groups. As a consequence, we establish a recent conjecture of Klick, Strungaru and Tcaciuc. Via a novel version of Furstenberg's Correspondence principle, which should be of independent interest, we show that our Szemer\'edi Theorems can be deduced from a general \emph{transverse} multiple recurrence theorem, which we establish using recent works of Austin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We help Alice play a certain "convergence game" against Bob and win the prize, which is a constructive solution to a problem by Erd\H{o}s and Graham, posed in their 1980 book on open questions in combinatorial number theory. Namely, after several reductions using peculiar arithmetic identities, the game outcome shows that the set of points \[ \Big(\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+1}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+2}\Big), \] obtained as $A$ ranges over infinite sets of positive integers, has a non-empty interior. This generalizes a two-dimensional result by Erd\H{o}s and Straus.</description>
