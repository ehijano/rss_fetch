      <title>Probing Dark Matter Isocurvature with Primordial Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple fields can become dynamical during the inflationary epoch. We consider an example where a light field acquires isocurvature fluctuations during inflation and contributes to the dark matter abundance at late times. Interactions between the light field and the adiabatic sector contribute to mixed adiabatic-isocurvature non-Gaussianity (NG). We show the resulting form of NG has a different kinematic dependence than the 'local shape' commonly considered, and highlight the parameter space where a dedicated search is expected to significantly improve the current $\textit{Planck}$ sensitivity. We interpret our results in the context of the QCD axion and illustrate how the proposed NG searches can improve upon the existing searches for isocurvature power spectrum and bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Probing Reheating with Gravitational Waves from Graviton Bremsstrahlung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, based on arXiv:2301.11345, arXiv:2305.16388, arXiv:2311.12694, we discuss the production of primordial gravitational waves (GW) sourced by graviton bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. For reheating, we consider inflaton decays and annihilations into pairs of bosons or fermions, assuming an inflaton $\phi$ that oscillates around a generic monomial potential $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$. The GW spectrum exhibits distinct features depending on the underlying reheating dynamics, which is controlled by the inflaton potential and the type of coupling between the inflaton and the matter fields. We show that the produced stochastic GW background could be probed in next-generation GW detectors, especially at high frequencies. We further highlight the potential of bremsstrahlung-induced GW to probe the underlying dynamics of reheating.</description>

      <title>Open Effective Field Theories for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When energy is not conserved, imprints of new physics on observable cosmology might not follow the rules of local effective actions. By capturing dissipative and diffusive effects, open effective field theories account for the possibly non-Hamiltonian evolution of cosmological inhomogeneities interacting with an unspecified environment. In this proceeding, we briefly discuss recent progress made towards their implementation in primordial cosmology. Our approach recovers the usual effective field theory of inflation in a certain limit and extends it to account for local dissipation and noises. Non-Gaussianities are generated that peak in the equilateral configuration for large dissipation and in the folded configurations for small dissipation. The construction provides an embedding for local dissipative models of inflation and a framework to study quantum information aspects of the inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Unleashing cosmic shear information with the tomographic weak lensing PDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the constraining power of the tomographic weak lensing convergence PDF for StageIV-like source galaxy redshift bins and shape noise. We focus on scales of $10$ to $20$ arcmin in the mildly nonlinear regime, where the convergence PDF and its changes with cosmological parameters can be predicted theoretically. We model the impact of reconstructing the convergence from the shear field using the well-known Kaiser-Squires formalism. We cross-validate the predicted and the measured convergence PDF derived from convergence maps reconstructed using simulated shear catalogues. Employing a Fisher forecast, we determine the constraining power for $(\Omega_{m},S_{8},w_{0})$. We find that adding a 5-bin tomography improves the $\kappa-$PDF constraints by a factor of $\{3.8,1.3,1.6\}$ for $(\Omega_{m}, S_{8},w_{0})$ respectively. Additionally, we perform a joint analysis with the shear two-point correlation functions, finding an enhancement of around a factor of $1.5$ on all parameters with respect to the two-point statistics alone. These improved constraints come from disentangling $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from $w_0$ by extracting non-Gaussian information, in particular, including the PDF skewness at different redshift bins. We also study the effect of varying the number of parameters to forecast, in particular we add $h$, finding that the convergence PDF maintains its constraining power while the precision from two-point correlations degrades by a factor of $\{1.7,1.4,1.8\}$ for $\{\Omega_{\rm m},S_8,w_0\}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Validation of the DESI 2024 Lyman Alpha Forest BAL Masking Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad absorption line quasars (BALs) exhibit blueshifted absorption relative to a number of their prominent broad emission features. These absorption features can contribute to quasar redshift errors and add absorption to the Lyman-alpha (LyA) forest that is unrelated to large-scale structure. We present a detailed analysis of the impact of BALs on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results with the LyA forest from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The baseline strategy for the first year analysis is to mask all pixels associated with all BAL absorption features that fall within the wavelength region used to measure the forest. We explore a range of alternate masking strategies and demonstrate that these changes have minimal impact on the BAO measurements with both DESI data and synthetic data. This includes when we mask the BAL features associated with emission lines outside of the forest region to minimize their contribution to redshift errors. We identify differences in the properties of BALs in the synthetic datasets relative to the observational data, as well as use the synthetic observations to characterize the completeness of the BAL identification algorithm, and demonstrate that incompleteness and differences in the BALs between real and synthetic data also do not impact the BAO results for the LyA forest.</description>

      <title>Reassessment of the dipole in the distribution of quasars on the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate claims of an anomalously large amplitude of the dipole in the distribution of quasars on the sky. Two main issues indicate that the systematic uncertainties in the derived quasar-density dipole are underestimated. Firstly, the spatial distribution of the quasars is not a pure dipole, possessing low-order multipoles of comparable size to the dipole. These multipoles are unexpected and presumably caused by unknown systematic effects; we cannot be confident that the dipole amplitude is not also affected by the same systematics until the origin of these fluctuations is understood. Secondly, the 50 percent sky cut associated with the quasar catalogue strongly couples the multipoles, meaning that the power estimate at ell=1 contains significant contributions from ell&gt;1. In particular, the dominant quadrupole mode in the Galactic mask strongly couples the dipole with the octupole, leading to a large uncertainty in the dipole amplitude. Together these issues mean that the dipole in the quasar catalogue has an uncertainty large enough that consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole cannot be ruled out. More generally, current data sets are insufficiently clean to robustly measure the quasar dipole and future studies will require samples that are larger (preferably covering more of the sky) and free of systematic effects to make strong claims regarding their consistency with the CMB dipole.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole formation from Affleck-Dine mechanism with suppressed clustering on large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a primordial black hole (PBH) formation model based on the framework of the inhomogeneous Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism, which can explain the seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). This model, however, predicts strong clustering of SMBHs that is inconsistent with the observation of angular correlation of quasars. In this paper, we propose a modified model that can significantly reduce the PBH clustering on large scales by considering a time-dependent Hubble-induced mass during inflation. The quasar angular correlation is suppressed by the large Hubble-induced mass in the early stage of inflation while the small Hubble-induced mass in the late stage leads to the AD field fluctuations large enough for PBH formation as in the original model. As a result, the modified scenario can successfully explain the seeds of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Density-based clustering algorithm for galaxy group/cluster identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct approach to studying the galaxy-halo connection is the analysis of observed groups and clusters of galaxies that trace the underlying dark matter halos, making identifying galaxy clusters and their associated brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) crucial. We test and propose a robust density-based clustering algorithm that outperforms the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm in the currently available galaxy group/cluster catalogs. Our new approach is a modified version of the Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithm, which accounts for line-of-sight positional uncertainties due to redshift space distortions by incorporating a scaling factor, and is thereby referred to as sOPTICS. When tested on both a galaxy group catalog based on semi-analytic galaxy formation simulations and observational data, our algorithm demonstrated robustness to outliers and relative insensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In total, we compared the results of eight clustering algorithms. The proposed density-based clustering method, sOPTICS, outperforms FoF in accurately identifying giant galaxy clusters and their associated BCGs in various environments with higher purity and recovery rate, also successfully recovering 115 BCGs out of 118 reliable BCGs from a large galaxy sample.</description>

      <title>Measuring cluster masses with Planck and SPT-SZ CMB lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster masses help to constrain cosmological parameters through the halo mass function. To get rid of major biases in the mass measurement, we directly probe the cluster gravitational potentials by observing their gravitational lensing on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We measured the average mass of a 468-cluster sample using SPT-SZ and Planck/HFI PR2 sky maps and compared it with the masses provided in the SPT-SZ data set. We found an average mass ratio of $M_{\rm CMBlens}/M_{\rm SZ} = 0.98 \pm 0.19$ (stat.) $\pm 0.03$ (syst.) [arxiv:2402.18346], in agreement with SPT-SZ masses. We also showed that the CMB large scales are important for the reconstruction of the lensing potential of a cluster with a quadratic estimator.</description>

      <title>Anomalous radial acceleration of galaxies and clusters supports hyperconical modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) is the most successful theory of gravity, with great observational support at local scales. However, to keep GR valid at over cosmic scales, some phenomena (such as the flat galaxy rotation curves and the cosmic acceleration) require the assumption of exotic dark matter. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) indicates a tight correlation between dynamical mass and baryonic mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters. This suggests that the observations could be better explained by modified gravity theories without exotic matter. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative theory for explaining some cases of flat galaxy rotation curves by using a new fundamental constant acceleration $a_0$, the so-called Milgromian parameter. However, this non-relativistic model is too rigid (with insufficient parameters) to fit the large diversity of observational phenomena. In contrast, a relativistic MOND-like gravity naturally emerges from the hyperconical model, which derives a fictitious acceleration compatible with observations. This study analyses the compatibility of the hyperconical model with respect to RAR observations of 10 galaxy clusters obtained from HIFLUGCS and 60 high-quality SPARC galaxy rotation curves. The results show that a general relation can be fitted to most cases with only one or two parameters, with an acceptable chi-square and $p$-value. These findings suggest a possible way to complete the proposed modification of GR on a cosmic scale.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves in the cosmological background with GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator for the 21-cm power spectrum from MWA drift scan observations I: Validation and preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drift scan observations provide the broad sky coverage and instrumental stability needed to measure the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal. In such observations, the telescope's pointing center (PC) moves continuously on the sky. The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator (TTGE) combines observations from different PC to estimate $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ the 21-cm power spectrum, centered on a tracking center (TC) which remains fixed on the sky. The tapering further restricts the sky response to a small angular region around TC, thereby mitigating wide-field foregrounds. Here we consider $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ ($z = 8.2$) Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations. The periodic pattern of flagged channels, present in MWA data, is known to introduce artefacts which pose a challenge for estimating $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$. We demonstrate that the TTGE is able to recover $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ without any artefacts, and estimate $P(k)$ within $5 \%$ accuracy over a large $k$-range. We also present preliminary results for a single PC, combining 9 nights of observation $(17 \, {\rm min}$ total). We find that $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ exhibits streaks at a fixed interval of $k_{\parallel}=0.29 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which matches $\Delta \nu_{\rm per}=1.28 \, {\rm MHz}$ that is the period of the flagged channels. The streaks are not as pronounced at larger $k_{\parallel}$, and in some cases they do not appear to extend across the entire $k_{\perp}$ range. The rectangular region $0.05 \leq k_{\perp} \leq 0.16 \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ and $0.9 \leq k_{\parallel} \leq 4.6 \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ is found to be relatively free of foreground contamination and artefacts, and we have used this to place the $2\sigma$ upper limit $\Delta^2(k) &lt; (1.85 \times 10^4)^2\, {\rm mK^2}$ on the EoR 21-cm mean squared brightness temperature fluctuations at $k=1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Cosmic shear with Einstein rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic shear is a key probe of modern cosmology. Amongst its challenges are shape noise and intrinsic alignments, both due to our ignorance of the unlensed shape of the source galaxies. I argue here that Einstein rings may be used as standard shape to measure the external shear along their line of sight. In the Euclid era, this new observable is expected to be a competitive and complementary probe of the large-scale structure of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies are a powerful probe of the early universe, and have largely contributed to establishing the current standard cosmological model. To extract the information encoded in those tiny variations, one must first compress the raw, time-domain data collected by a telescope into maps of the sky at the observed frequencies, in a procedure known as map-making. I provide a general introduction to this problem, and highlight a few specificities of the MAPPRAISER implementation.</description>

      <title>KiDS-1000 and DES-Y1 combined: Cosmology from peak count statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and extract cosmological parameter constraints based on the cosmic shear peak count statistics. Peaks are identified in aperture mass maps in which the filter is maximally sensitive to angular scales in the range 2-4arcmin, probing deep into the non-linear regime of structure formation. We interpret our results with a simulation-based inference pipeline, sampling over a broad $w$CDM prior volume and marginalising over uncertainties on shape calibration, photometric redshift distribution, intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. Our measurements constrain the structure growth parameter and the amplitude of the non-linear intrinsic alignment model to $\Sigma_8 \equiv \sigma_8\left[\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right]^{0.60}=0.765^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$ and $A_{\rm IA}= 0.71^{+0.42}_{-0.42}$, respectively, in agreement with previous KiDS-1000 results based on two-point shear statistics. These results are robust against modelling of the non-linear physics, different scale cuts and selections of tomographic bins. The posterior is also consistent with that from the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 peak count analysis presented in Harnois-D\'eraps et al (2021), and hence we jointly analyse both surveys. We obtain $\Sigma_8^{\rm joint} \equiv \sigma_8\left[\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right]^{0.57}=0.759^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$, in agreement with the Planck $w$CDM results. The shear-CMB tension on this parameter increases to $3.1\sigma$ when forcing $w=-1.0$, and to $4.1\sigma$ if comparing instead with $S_{8,\Lambda{\rm CDM}}^{\rm joint} = 0.736^{+0.016}_{-0.018}$, one of the tightest constraints to date on this quantity.

      <title>Fast simulation mapping: from standard to modified gravity cosmologies using the bias assignment method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the effectiveness of a non-parametric bias model in generating mock halo catalogues for modified gravity (MG) cosmologies, relying on the distribution of dark matter from either MG or $\Lambda$CDM. We aim to generate halo catalogues that effectively capture the distinct impact of MG, ensuring high accuracy in both two- and three-point statistics for comprehensive analysis of large-scale structures. As part of this study we aim at investigating the inclusion of MG into non-local bias to directly map the tracers onto $\Lambda$CDM fields, which would save many computational costs. We employ the bias assignment method (BAM) to model halo distribution statistics by leveraging seven high-resolution COLA simulations of MG cosmologies. Taking into account cosmic-web dependencies when learning the bias relations, we design two experiments to map the MG effects: one utilising the consistent MG density fields and the other employing the benchmark $\Lambda$CDM density field. BAM generates MG halo catalogues from both calibrations experiments excelling in summary statistics, achieving a $\sim 1\%$ accuracy in the power spectrum across a wide range of $k$-modes, with only minimal differences well below 10\% at modes subject to cosmic variance, particularly below $k&lt;0.07$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$. The reduced bispectrum remains consistent with the reference catalogues within 10\% for the studied configuration. Our results demonstrate that a non-linear and non-local bias description can model the effects of MG starting from a $\Lambda$CDM dark matter field.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication to nano-hertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Open star clusters and their asymmetrical tidal tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars that evaporate from their star cluster by the energy equipartition process end up either in a leading or a trailing tidal tail. In Newtonian gravitation and for open star clusters in the Solar vicinity, the tidal threshold, or prah, for escape is symmetrical, such that the leading and trailing tails are equally populated. The data by six independent teams that applied the convergent point method to map out the tidal tails of four open clusters (the Hyades, the Praesepe, Coma Berenices and COIN-Gaia13) using Gaia DR2 and DR3 are here applied to test for the expected symmetry. All tidal tails contain more stars in the leading tail. The combined confidence amounts to an 8 sigma falsification of the prah symmetry. The same test using Milgromian dynamics leads to consistency with the data. More effort needs to be exerted on this matter, but the data indicate with high confidence that the tidal prah of an open star cluster is asymmetrical with the corresponding confidence that Newtonian gravitation is falsified. Open star clusters depopulate more rapidly in Milgromian than in Newtonian dynamics and the COIN-Gaia13 cluster is here found to be nearly completely dissolved. In view of these results, the wide-binary star test and the Keplerian Galactic rotation curve finding are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Radial Profile of Galactic Magnetic Fields using Rotation Measure of Background Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing magnetic fields in high-redshift galactic systems is crucial to investigate galactic dynamics and evolution. Utilizing the rotation measure of the background quasars, we have developed a radial profile of the magnetic field in a typical high-$z$ galaxy. We have compiled a catalog of 59 confirmed quasar sightlines, having one intervening Mg \rom{2} absorber in the redshift range $0.372\leq z_{\text{abs}} \leq 0.8$. The presence of the foreground galaxy is ensured by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts within $3 \sigma_{z-\text{photo}}$ and visual checks. These quasar line-of-sights (LoS) pass through various impact parameters (D) up to $160$ kpc, covering the circumgalactic medium of a typical Milky-Way type galaxy. Utilizing the residual rotation measure (RRM) of these sightlines, we estimated the excess in RRM dispersion, $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$. We found that the sightlines having impact parameters $\text{D} \leq 50$ kpc and $\text{D} &gt; 50$ kpc, $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ show significant difference from $24.86 \pm 3.08$ rad m$^{-2}$ to $16.34 \pm 1.88$ rad m$^{-2}$ respectively. The profile of $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ with D exhibits a decreasing trend. We translated $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ to average LoS magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\|}\rangle$ by considering a typical electron column density. Consequently, the anti-correlation is sustained, resulting in a decreasing magnetic field profile. This suggests a clear indication of varying magnetic field from the disk to the circumgalactic medium. This work provides a methodology that, when applied to ongoing and future radio polarisation surveys such as LOFAR and SKA, promises to significantly enhance our understanding of magnetic field mapping in galactic systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating IceCube neutrinos with a large set of galaxy samples around redshift z ~ 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino telescope has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, but the sources of this flux have largely remained elusive. Using the 10-year IceCube public dataset, we search for correlations between neutrino events and tracers of large-scale structure (LSS). We conduct a combined cross-correlation analysis using several wide-area galaxy catalogs spanning a redshift range of z = 0.1 to z ~ 2.5 as well as maps of the cosmic infrared background. We do not detect a definitive signal, but find tantalizing hints of a potential positive correlation between neutrinos and the tracers of LSS. We additionally construct a simple model to interpret galaxy-neutrino cross-correlations in terms of the redshift distribution of neutrino sources. We put upper limits on the clustering amplitude of neutrinos based on the measured cross-correlations with galaxies and forecast the improvements on these constraints that can be obtained using future detectors. We show that, in the future, neutrino-galaxy cross-correlations should be a powerful probe to constrain properties of neutrino source populations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Singularity and Power-Law Solutions in Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Ionizing Photon Contributions of High-Redshift Galaxies to Reionization with JWST NIRCam Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have the potential to provide unprecedented constraints on the history of reionization and the sources responsible for the ionizing photons due to the detection of large populations of faint galaxies at $z\gg6$. Modelling reionization requires knowing both the number of ionizing photons that are produced by galaxies and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium. Observational estimates of these values generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions remain limited. To overcome this challenge, we present an implicit likelihood inference (ILI) pipeline trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies ($\dot{n}_{\rm ion}$) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. Compared to traditional SED-fitting methods, the new ILI pipeline is consistently more accurate and significantly faster. We deploy the method on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding a gentle redshift evolution of $\log_{10}(\dot{n}_{\rm ion}) = (0.08\pm0.01)z + (51.60\pm0.06)$, with late-time values for $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the volume-averaged ionized fraction and optical depth to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization to completion at $z\sim 5.3$ without the need for AGN or other exotic sources. The $20\%$ of UV-brightest galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5$) in our sample can reionize only $\sim30\%$ of the survey volume, demonstrating that faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal coupling of massless fermions to gravity does not allow for their gravitational production solely based on the expansion of the Universe. We argue that this changes in presence of realistic and potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We compute the resulting energy density of Weyl fermions at 1-loop using in--in formalism. If the initially massless fermions eventually acquire mass, this mechanism can explain the dark matter abundance in the Universe. Remarkably, it may be more efficient than conventional gravitational production of superheavy fermions.</description>

      <title>X-ray Cool Core Remnants Heated by Strong Radio AGN Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong AGN heating provides an alternative means for the disruption of cluster cool cores (CCs) to cluster mergers. In this work we present a systematic Chandra study of a sample of 108 nearby ($z&lt;0.1$) galaxy clusters, to investigate the effect of AGN heating on CCs. About 40% of clusters with small offsets between the BCG and the X-ray centre ($\le50$ kpc) have small CCs. For comparison, 14 of 17 clusters with large offsets have small CCs, which suggests that mergers or sloshing can be efficient in reducing the CC size. Relaxed, small CC clusters generally have weak radio AGNs ($P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and they show a lack of systems hosting a radio AGN with intermediate radio power ($2\times10^{23}&lt;P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;2\times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). We found that the strongest circumnuclear ($&lt;1$ kpc) X-ray emission only exists in clusters with strong radio AGN. The duty cycle of relaxed, small CC clusters is less than half of that for large CC clusters. It suggests that the radio activity of BCGs is affected by the properties of the surrounding gas beyond the central $\sim10$ kpc, and strong radio AGNs in small X-ray CCs fade more rapidly than those embedded in large X-ray CCs. A scenario is also presented for the transition of large CCs and coronae due to radio AGN feedback. We also present a detailed analysis of galaxy cluster 3C 129.1 as an example of a CC remnant possibly disrupted by radio AGN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

Abstract: We review a number of unimodular no-scale supergravity models with F-term SUSY breaking which support technically natural de Sitter vacua. A variant of these models develops a stage of inflection-point inflation which can be realized for subplanckian field values consistently with the observational data. For central value of the spectral index ns, the necessary tuning is of the order of 10^-6, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is tiny whereas the running of ns is around -3x10^-3. Our proposal is compatible with high-scale SUSY and the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <title>First star formation in extremely early epochs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First stars play crucial roles in development of the universe, influencing events like cosmic reionization and the chemical enrichment. While first stars are conventionally thought to form at around $z \sim 20-30$ in the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, observational constraints on small-scale density fluctuations remain limited, possibly differing significantly from the scale-invariant fluctuations assumed in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Should this be the case, the formation of first stars could occur much earlier than typically predicted. In this study, we investigate the formation process of first stars in the extremely early epochs of $z \gtrsim 100$ in the post-recombination universe. At such early times, the effects of the warm cosmic microwave background (CMB) become significant. We calculate the collapse of primordial star-forming clouds using a one-zone thermo-chemical model that accounts for CMB influences on radiative heating, Compton cooling, and photodissociation reactions. We found that the impact of the CMB on the evolution is limited at $z \lesssim 100$, with the temperature evolution closely resembling the conventional model. However, within the range $100 \lesssim z \lesssim 400$, the formation of H$_2$ via the H$^-$ channel is impeded by H$^-$ photodetachment induced by the CMB, leading to higher temperatures compared to standard one. Consequently, first stars with masses exceeding $1000 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ can emerge at $z \gtrsim 100$. Furthermore, at $z \gtrsim 500$, the temperature evolution becomes nearly isothermal solely due to atomic cooling, as H$_2$ formation is entirely suppressed. In such cases, supermassive stars with masses around $\sim 10^5 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ are expected to form solely via atomic cooling. These findings emphasize the significant variation in the typical mass of the first stars depending on the epoch of formation.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Reconstruction of UV Luminosity Function and Reionization Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts $z \sim 2-8$. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the luminosity-magnitude relation at redshifts $z=3$ and $4$. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of $-17$. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam data at $z \sim 9-12$. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be $\tau_{\rm re}=0.0494^{+0.0007}_{-0.0006}$ and the duration between 10$\% $ and 90$\%$ completion of ionization process is found to be $\Delta z\sim 1.627^{+0.059}_{-0.071}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of gravitational-wave background searches to constrain cosmic histories characterised by a stiff equation of state, preceded by a period of matter domination. Such a scenario leads to a characteristic peak in the primordial gravitational-wave spectrum originating from cosmological inflation. Assuming instant transitions between distinct epochs, which allows an analytical treatment of the gravitational-wave spectrum, we perform a Bayesian inference analysis to derive constraints from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Additionally, we consider a smooth transition, employing an axion-like particle physics model, and highlight the difference with the instant transition approximation. We then forecast detection prospects for such a cosmic history through future gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Warm Dark Matter: from Cosmological Asymmetry to Chirality of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel scenario involving asymmetric keV-range dark matter (DM) in the form of right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. Based on the Fermi-Dirac distribution, we demonstrate that asymmetric fermionic DM forms a Fermi degenerate gas, making it potentially colder than symmetric fermionic DM. This setup simultaneously accounts for the Universe's baryon asymmetry through tiny Yukawa interactions with Standard Model leptons and the Higgs field, and the homochirality of amino acids via decay into circularly polarized photons. This scenario can be investigated through soft X-ray searches conducted by current and upcoming space missions. The helical X-rays is a smoking-gun signal of our scenario. Additionally, we propose a new mechanism to suppress DM thermal production by introducing a light modulus, which may also benefit cosmology involving generic right-handed neutrinos with large mixing.</description>

Abstract: In order to extract maximal information about cosmology from the large-scale structure of the Universe, one needs to use every bit of signal that can be observed. Beyond the spatial distributions of astronomical objects, the spatial correlations of tensor fields, such as galaxy spins and shapes, are ones of promising sources that can be accessed in the era of large surveys in the near future. The perturbation theory is a powerful tool to analytically describe the behaviors and evolutions of correlation statistics on large scales for a given cosmology. In this paper, we formulate a nonlinear perturbation theory of tensor fields in general, based on the formulation of integrated perturbation theory for the scalar-valued bias, generalizing it to include the tensor-valued bias. To take advantage of rotational symmetry, the formalism is constructed on the basis of the irreducible decomposition of tensors, identifying physical variables which are invariant under the rotation of the coordinates system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous paper [arXiv:2210.10435], the nonlinear perturbation theory of cosmological density field is generalized to include the tensor-valued bias of astronomical objects, such as spins and shapes of galaxies and any other tensors of arbitrary ranks which are associated with objects that we can observe. We apply this newly developed method to explicitly calculate nonlinear power spectra and correlation functions both in real space and in redshift space. Multi-dimensional integrals that appear in loop corrections are reduced to combinations of one-dimensional Hankel transforms, thanks to the spherical basis of the formalism, and the final expressions are numerically evaluated in a very short time using an algorithm of the fast Fourier transforms such as \textsc{FFTLog}. As an illustrative example, numerical evaluations of loop corrections of the power spectrum and correlation function of the rank-2 tensor field are demonstrated with a simple model of tensor bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of various measures of quantumness of the curvature perturbation by integrating out the inaccessible entropic fluctuations in the multi-field models of inflation. In particular, we discuss the following measures of quantumness, namely purity, entanglement entropy and quantum discord. The models being considered in this work are ones that produce large scale curvature power spectra similar to those produced by single-field models of inflation. More specifically, we consider different multi-field models which generate nearly scale invariant and oscillatory curvature power spectrum and compare their quantum signatures in the perturbations with the corresponding single-field models. We find that, even though different models of inflation may produce the same observable power spectrum on large scales, they have distinct quantum signatures arising from the perturbation modes. This may allow for a way to distinguish between different models of inflation based on their quantum signatures. Intriguingly, this result generalizes to bouncing scenarios as well.</description>

Abstract: The integrated perturbation theory (iPT) is a set of methods in nonlinear perturbation theory for the structure formation in the Universe. In Papers I and II [arXiv:2210.10435, arXiv:2210.11085], the basic formalism and technical methods of the iPT for cosmological tensor fields are developed, generalizing the corresponding theory for scalar fields. In previous papers, methods to predict statistical quantities, such as power spectra, correlation functions, etc., of three-dimensional tensor fields are developed based on the iPT. However, observations of tensors, such as angular momenta and shapes of galaxies, etc., are only possible after the three-dimensional tensors are projected onto the two-dimensional sky. In this paper, power spectra and correlation functions of projected two-dimensional tensors are related to those of original three-dimensional tensors, so that one can make predictions for the observable statistics of projected tensor fields from the iPT. The relations are consistently represented on the basis of irreducible decomposition of both two- and three-dimensional tensors.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array: IV. Implications for massive black holes, dark matter and the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) collaborations have measured a low-frequency common signal in the combination of their second and first data releases respectively, with the correlation properties of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Such signal may have its origin in a number of physical processes including a cosmic population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs); inflation, phase transitions, cosmic strings and tensor mode generation by non-linear evolution of scalar perturbations in the early Universe; oscillations of the Galactic potential in the presence of ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). At the current stage of emerging evidence, it is impossible to discriminate among the different origins. Therefore, in this paper, we consider each process separately, and investigate the implications of the signal under the hypothesis that it is generated by that specific process. We find that the signal is consistent with a cosmic population of inspiralling SMBHBs, and its relatively high amplitude can be used to place constraints on binary merger timescales and the SMBH-host galaxy scaling relations. If this origin is confirmed, this is the first direct evidence that SMBHBs merge in nature, adding an important observational piece to the puzzle of structure formation and galaxy evolution. As for early Universe processes, the measurement would place tight constraints on the cosmic string tension and on the level of turbulence developed by first-order phase transitions. Other processes would require non-standard scenarios, such as a blue-tilted inflationary spectrum or an excess in the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations at large wavenumbers. Finally, a ULDM origin of the detected signal is disfavoured, which leads to direct constraints on the abundance of ULDM in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Weak Lensing with Gaia DR3 and Future Catalogs: Searches for Dark Matter Substructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-scale dark matter structures lighter than a billion solar masses are an important probe of primordial density fluctuations and dark matter microphysics. Due to their lack of starlight emission, their only guaranteed signatures are gravitational in nature. We report on results of a search for astrometric weak lensing by compact dark matter subhalos in the Milky Way with Gaia DR3 data. Using a matched-filter analysis to look for correlated imprints of time-domain lensing on the proper motions of background stars in the Magellanic Clouds, we exclude order-unity substructure fractions in halos with masses $M_{l}$ between $10^{7} \, M_{\odot}$ and $10^{9} \, M_{\odot}$ and sizes of one parsec or smaller. We forecast that a similar approach based on proper accelerations across the entire sky with data from Gaia DR4 may be sensitive to substructure fractions of $f_{l} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ in the much lower mass range of $10 \, M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{l} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{3} \, M_{\odot}$. We further propose an analogous technique for stacked star-star lensing events in the regime of large impact parameters. Our first implementation is not yet sufficiently sensitive but serves as a useful diagnostic and calibration tool; future data releases should enable average stellar mass measurements using this stacking method.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Thermal Friction of Axion Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the process in which axion dark matter undergoes thermal friction, resulting in energy injection into dark radiation, with the aim of mitigating the Hubble tension and large-scale structure tension. In the early universe, this scenario led to a rapid increase in the energy density of dark radiation; in the late universe, the evolution of axion dark matter is similar to that of cold dark matter, with this scenario resembling decaying dark matter and serving to ease the large-scale structure tension. We employ cosmological observational data, including cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), supernova data (SNIa), $H_0$ measurement from SH0ES, and $S_8$ from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DES), to study and analyze this model. Our results indicate that the thermal friction model offers partial alleviation of the large-scale structure tension, while its contribution on alleviating Hubble tension can be ignored. The new model yields the value of $S_8$ is $0.795\pm 0.011$ at a 68% confidence level, while the $\Lambda$CDM model yields a result of $0.8023\pm 0.0085$. In addition, the new model exhibits a lower $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ value, with a difference of -2.60 compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, we incorporate Lyman-$\alpha$ data to re-constrain the new model and find a slight improvement in the results, with the values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ being $68.76^{+0.39}_{-0.35}$ km/s/Mpc and $0.791\pm 0.011$ at a 68% confidence level, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We combine the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) second data release (DR2) catalogue with gravitational lensing maps from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to place constraints on the bias evolution of LoTSS radio galaxies, and on the amplitude of matter perturbations. We construct a flux-limited catalogue, and analyse its harmonic-space cross-correlation with CMB lensing maps from Planck, $C_\ell^{g\kappa}$, as well as its auto-correlation, $C_\ell^{gg}$. We explore the models describing the redshift evolution of the large-scale radio galaxy bias, discriminating between them through the combination of both $C_\ell^{g\kappa}$ and $C_\ell^{gg}$. Fixing the bias evolution, we then use these data to place constraints on the amplitude of large scale density fluctuations. We report the significance of the $C_\ell^{g\kappa}$ signal at a level of $26.6\sigma$. We determine that a linear bias evolution of the form $b_g(z) = b_{g,D} / D(z)$, where $D(z)$ is the growth rate, is able to provide a good description of the data, and measure $b_{g,D} = 1.41 \pm 0.06$ for a sample flux-limited at $1.5\,{\rm mJy}$, for scales $\ell &lt; 250$ for $C_\ell^{gg}$, and $\ell &lt; 500$ for $C_\ell^{g\kappa}$. At the sample's median redshift, we obtain $b(z = 0.82) = 2.34 \pm 0.10$. Using $\sigma_8$ as a free parameter, while keeping other cosmological parameters fixed to the Planck values, we find fluctuations of $\sigma_8 = 0.75^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. The result is in agreement with weak lensing surveys, and at $1\sigma$ difference with Planck CMB constraints. We also attempt to detect the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect with LOFAR, but with the current sky coverage, the cross-correlation with CMB temperature maps is consistent with zero. Our results are an important step towards constraining cosmology with radio continuum surveys from LOFAR and other future large radio surveys.</description>

      <title>A visual tool for assessing tension-resolving models in the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models have been proposed to address various shortcomings of the standard cosmological model, such as the ``Hubble tension.'' These models often have an impact on the discrepancy in the amplitude of matter clustering, the ``$\sigma_8$-tension.'' To explore the interplay between the two tensions, we suggest a simple method to visualize the relation between the two parameters: $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$. For a given extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model and dataset, we plot the relation between $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ for different amplitudes of the beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics. In this work, we use this visualization method to illustrate the trend of selected cosmological models, including nonminimal Higgs-like inflation, early dark energy, a varying effective electron mass, an extra number of relativistic species and modified dark energy models. Although already studied in the literature, some of these models have not been analyzed in view of the two joint tensions. We stress that the method used here could be a useful diagnostic tool to illustrate the behavior of complex cosmological models with many parameters in the context of the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.</description>

Abstract: We construct an anti-halo void catalogue of $150$ voids with radii $R &gt; 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{\,Mpc}$ in the Local Super-Volume ($&lt;135\,h^{-1}\mathrm{\,Mpc}$ from the Milky Way), using posterior resimulation of initial conditions inferred by field-level inference with Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (\codefont{BORG}). We describe and make use of a new algorithm for creating a single, unified void catalogue by combining different samples from the posterior. The catalogue is complete out to $135\,h^{-1}\mathrm{\,Mpc}$, with void abundances matching theoretical predictions. Finally, we compute stacked density profiles of those voids which are reliably identified across posterior samples, and show that these are compatible with $\Lambda$CDM expectations once environmental selection (e.g., the estimated $\sim 4\%$ under-density of the Local Super-Volume) is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Detecting strongly-lensed type Ia supernovae with LSST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly-lensed supernovae are rare and valuable probes of cosmology and astrophysics. Upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), are expected to discover an order-of-magnitude more lensed supernovae than have previously been observed. In this work, we investigate the cosmological prospects of lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) in LSST by quantifying the expected annual number of detections, the impact of stellar microlensing, follow-up feasibility, and how to best separate lensed and unlensed SNIa. We simulate SNIa lensed by galaxies, using the current LSST baseline v3.0 cadence, and find an expected number of 44 lensed SNIa detections per year. Microlensing effects by stars in the lens galaxy are predicted to lower the lensed SNIa detections by $\sim 8 \%$. The lensed events can be separated from the unlensed ones by jointly considering their colours and peak magnitudes. We define a `gold sample' of $\sim 10$ lensed SNIa per year with time delay $&gt; 10$ days, $&gt; 5$ detections before light-curve peak, and sufficiently bright ($m_i &lt; 22.5$ mag) for follow-up observations. In three years of LSST operations, such a sample is expected to yield a $1.5\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Causal bounds on cosmological angular correlation</title>

Abstract: We formulate a new hypothesis for causal coherence of gravitational quantum fluctuations, and test its predicted constraints on large-scale angular correlations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We posit that {\it quantum fluctuations generate physical correlations of gravitational potential only within compact causal diamonds bounded by inflationary horizons}. It is shown that the angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ of gravitationally-induced CMB anisotropy is thereby constrained by conformally invariant geometry to exactly vanish at large angular separations: even-parity correlation vanishes in a range $\Theta= \pi/2 \pm \arcsin(1/4)$, and total correlation vanishes over a larger range that could extend as far as $\Theta=3\pi/4$. This geometrical causal symmetry is tested with CMB correlations in all-sky maps from the {\sl WMAP} and {\sl Planck} satellites, allowing for unmeasured dipole anisotropy. Correlations in this range of angular separation are indeed found to be much smaller than expected in standard realizations based on local effective quantum field theory, which produce correlations three to four orders of magnitude larger than those in the {\sl Planck} maps, and deviate as little from zero as the maps do with probabilities that range from $\simeq 10^{-4.3}$ to $\simeq 10^{-2.8}$. These results could indicate that large-angle CMB anisotropy preserves a primordial causal symmetry of quantum gravity that is not included in the standard quantum model of inflation.</description>

      <title>Collapsing Domain Wall Networks: Impact on Pulsar Timing Arrays and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unstable domain wall (DW) networks in the early universe are cosmologically viable and can emit a large amount of gravitational waves (GW) before annihilating. As such, they provide an interpretation for the recent signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. A related important question is whether such a scenario also leads to significant production of Primordial Black Holes (PBH). We investigate both GW and PBH production using 3D numerical simulations in an expanding background, with box sizes up to $N=3240$, including the annihilation phase. We find that: i) the network decays exponentially, i.e. the false vacuum volume drops as $\sim \exp(-\eta^3)$, with $\eta$ the conformal time; ii) the GW spectrum is larger than traditional estimates by more than one order of magnitude, due to a delay between DW annihilation and the sourcing of GWs. We then present a novel semi-analytical method to estimate the PBH abundances: rare false vacuum pockets of super-Hubble size collapse to PBHs if their energy density becomes comparable to the background when they cross the Hubble scale. Smaller (but more abundant) pockets will instead collapse only if they are close to spherical. This introduces very large uncertainties in the final PBH abundance. The first phenomenological implication is that the DW interpretation of the PTA signal is compatible with observational constraints on PBHs, within the uncertainties. Second, in a different parameter region, the dark matter can be entirely in the form of asteroid-mass PBHs from the DW collapse. Remarkably, this would also lead to a GW background in the observable range of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and future interferometers, such as LISA and Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Post-inflationary Leptogenesis and Dark Matter production: Metric versus Palatini formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate production of non-thermal dark matter particles and heavy sterile neutrinos from inflaton during the reheating era, which is preceded by a slow-roll inflationary epoch with a quartic potential and non-minimal coupling ($\xi$) between inflaton and gravity. We compare our analysis between metric and Palatini formalism. For the latter, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, decreases with $\xi$. We find that for $\xi=0.5$ and number of $e$-folds $\sim 60$, $r$ can be as small as $\sim {\cal O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$ which may be validated at future reaches of upcoming CMB observation such as CMB-S4 etc. We identify the permissible range of Yukawa coupling $y_\chi$ between inflaton and fermionic DM $\chi$, to be ${\cal O}\left(10^{-3.5}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-20}\right)$ for metric formalism and ${\cal O}\left(10^{-4}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-11}\right)$ for Palatini formalism which is consistent with current PLANCK data and also within the reach of future CMB experiments. For the scenario of leptogenesis via the decay of sterile neutrinos produced from inflaton decay, we also investigate the parameter space involving heavy neutrino mass $M_{N_1}$ and Yukawa coupling $y_{N_1}$ of sterile neutrino with inflaton, which are consistent with current CMB data and successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis. In contrast to metric formalism, in the case of Palatini formalism, for successful leptogenesis to occur, we find that $y_{N_1}$ has a very narrow allowable range and is severely constrained from the consistency with CMB predictions.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in the Dark?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

      <title>Alleviating $H_0$ and $S_8$ Tensions Simultaneously in K-essence Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the growth of structure parameter $S_8$ can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, our model can reduce $H_0$ tension to roughly $2.2 \sigma$ and the $S_8$ discrepancy diminishes to $0.82\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clusters in Milgromian dynamics: Missing matter, hydrostatic bias, and the external field effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mass distribution of galaxy clusters in Milgromian dynamics, or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We focus on five galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample, for which high-quality data are available on both the baryonic mass distribution (gas and stars) and internal dynamics (from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect). We confirm that galaxy clusters require additional `missing matter' in MOND, although the required amount is drastically reduced with respect to the non-baryonic dark matter in the context of Newtonian dynamics. We studied the spatial distribution of the missing matter by fitting the acceleration profiles of the clusters with a Bayesian method, finding that a physical density profile with an inner core and an outer $r^{-4}$ decline (giving a finite total mass) provide good fits within $\sim$1 Mpc. At larger radii, the fit results are less satisfactory but the combination of the MOND external field effect and hydrostatic bias (quantified as 10$\%$-40$\%$) can play a key role. The missing mass must be more centrally concentrated than the intracluster medium (ICM). For relaxed clusters (A1795, A2029, A2142), the ratio of missing-to-visible mass is around $1-5$ at $R\simeq200-300$ kpc and decreases to $0.4-1.1$ at $R\simeq2-3$ Mpc, showing that the total amount of missing mass is smaller than or comparable to the ICM mass. For clusters with known merger signatures (A644 and A2319), this global ratio increases up to $\sim$5 but may indicate out-of-equilibrium dynamics rather than actual missing mass. We discuss various possibilities regarding the nature of the extra mass, in particular `missing baryons' in the form of pressure-confined cold gas clouds with masses of $&lt;10^5$ M$_\odot$ and sizes of $&lt; 50$ pc.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilations Around Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmology may give rise to appreciable populations of both particle dark matter and primordial black holes (PBH) with the combined mass density providing the observationally inferred value $\Omega_{\rm DM}\approx0.26$. However, previous studies have highlighted that scenarios with both particle dark matter and PBH are strongly excluded by $\gamma$-ray limits for particle dark matter with a velocity independent thermal cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, as is the case for classic WIMP dark matter. Here we extend these existing studies on $s$-wave annihilating particle dark matter to ascertain the limits from diffuse $\gamma$-rays on velocity dependent annihilations which are $p$-wave with $\langle\sigma v \rangle\propto v^2$ or $d$-wave with $\langle\sigma v \rangle\propto v^4$, which we find to be considerably less constraining. Furthermore, we highlight that even if the freeze-out process is $p$-wave it is relatively common for (loop/phase-space) suppressed $s$-wave processes to actually provide the leading contributions to the experimentally constrained $\gamma$-ray flux from the PBH halo. This work also utilyses a refined treatment of the PBH dark matter density profile and outlines an improved application of extra-galactic $\gamma$-ray bounds.</description>

      <title>Can supercooled phase transitions explain the gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17239v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array collaborations recently reported evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies. Whilst the SGWB could originate from the merger of supermassive black holes, it could be a signature of new physics near the 100 MeV scale. Supercooled first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) that end at the 100 MeV scale are intriguing explanations, because they could connect the nHz signal to new physics at the electroweak scale or beyond. Here, however, we provide a clear demonstration that it is not simple to create a nHz signal from a supercooled phase transition, due to two crucial issues that could rule out many proposed supercooled explanations and should be checked. As an example, we use a model based on non-linearly realized electroweak symmetry that has been cited as evidence for a supercooled explanation. First, we show that a FOPT cannot complete for the required transition temperature of around 100 MeV. Such supercooling implies a period of vacuum domination that hinders bubble percolation and transition completion. Second, we show that even if completion is not required or if this constraint is evaded, the Universe typically reheats to the scale of any physics driving the FOPT. The hierarchy between the transition and reheating temperature makes it challenging to compute the spectrum of the SGWB.</description>

      <title>Chemical Diagnostics to Unveil Environments Enriched by First Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unveiling the chemical fingerprints of the first (Pop III) stars is crucial for indirectly studying their properties and probing their massive nature. In particular, very massive Pop III stars explode as energetic Pair-Instability Supernovae (PISNe), allowing their chemical products to escape in the diffuse medium around galaxies, opening the possibility to observe their fingerprints in distant gas clouds. Recently, three z &gt; 6.3 absorbers with abundances consistent with an enrichment from PISNe have been observed with JWST. In this Letter, we present novel chemical diagnostics to uncover environments mainly imprinted by PISNe. Furthermore, we revise the JWST low-resolution measurements by analyzing the publicly available high-resolution X-Shooter spectra for two of these systems. Our results reconcile the chemical abundances of these absorbers with those from literature, which are found to be consistent with an enrichment dominated (&gt; 50% metals) by normal Pop II SNe. We show the power of our novel diagnostics in isolating environments uniquely enriched by PISNe from those mainly polluted by other Pop III and Pop II SNe. When the subsequent enrichment from Pop II SNe is included, however, we find that the abundances of PISN-dominated environments partially overlap with those predominantly enriched by other Pop III and Pop II SNe. We dub these areas confusion regions. Yet, the odd-even abundance ratios [Mg,Si/Al] are extremely effective in pinpointing PISN- dominated environments and allowed us to uncover, for the first time, an absorber consistent with a combined enrichment by a PISN and another Pop III SN for all the six measured elements.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of dark matter with the extreme galaxy AGC 114905</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AGC 114905 is a dwarf gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy seemingly in tension with the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Specifically, the galaxy appears to have an extremely low-density halo and a high baryon fraction, while CDM predicts dwarfs to have very dense and dominant dark haloes. The alleged tension relies on the galaxy's rotation curve decomposition, which depends heavily on its inclination. This inclination, estimated from the gas (neutral atomic hydrogen, HI) morphology, remains somewhat uncertain. We present unmatched ultra-deep optical imaging of AGC 114905 reaching surface brightness limits $\mu_{\rm r,lim} \approx 32$ mag/arcsec$^2$ ($3\sigma$; 10 arcsec $\times$ 10 arcsec) obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. With the new imaging, we characterise the galaxy's morphology, surface brightness, colours, and stellar mass profiles in great detail. The stellar disc has a similar extent as the gas, presents spiral arms-like features, and shows a well-defined edge. Stars and gas share similar morphology, and crucially, we find an inclination of $31\pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the previous determinations. We revisit the rotation curve decomposition of the galaxy, and we explore different mass models in the context of CDM, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), fuzzy dark matter (FDM) or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We find that the latter does not fit the circular speed of the galaxy, while CDM only does so with dark halo parameters rarely seen in cosmological simulations. Within the uncertainties, SIDM and FDM remain feasible candidates to explain the observed kinematics of AGC 114905.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation and Dark Sector from 11D Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori with general genus and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the four-dimensional FRW universe emerges as a solution representing cosmological D3-branes in the eleven-dimensional bulk. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>
