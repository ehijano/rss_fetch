      <title>Analog-Based Forecasting of Turbulent Velocity: Relationship between Predictability and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of analog-based methodologies to predict the longitudinal velocity in a turbulent flow. The data used comes from hot wire experimental measurements from the Modane wind tunnel. We compared different methods and explored the impact of varying the number of analogs and their sizes on prediction accuracy. We illustrate that the innovation, defined as the difference between the true velocity value and the prediction value, highlights particularly unpredictable events that we directly link with extreme events of the velocity gradients and so to intermittency. This result indicates that while the estimator effectively seizes linear correlations, it fails to fully capture higher-order dependencies. The innovation underscores the presence of intermittency, revealing the limitations of current predictive models and suggesting directions for future improvements in turbulence forecasting.</description>

      <title>Converting sWeights to Probabilities with Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning approaches continues to have many benefits in experimental nuclear and particle physics. One common issue is generating training data which is sufficiently realistic to give reliable results. Here we advocate using real experimental data as the source of training data and demonstrate how one might subtract background contributions through the use of probabilistic weights which can be readily applied to training data. The sPlot formalism is a common tool used to isolate distributions from different sources. However, negative sWeights produced by the sPlot technique can lead to issues in training and poor predictive power. This article demonstrates how density ratio estimation can be applied to convert sWeights to event probabilities, which we call drWeights. The drWeights can then be applied to produce the distributions of interest and are consistent with direct use of the sWeights. This article will also show how decision trees are particular well suited to converting sWeights, with the benefit of fast prediction rates and adaptability to aspects of the experimental data such as data sample size and proportions of different event sources. We also show that a double density ratio approach where the initial drWeights are reweighted by an additional classifier gives substantially better results.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>

      <title>Structural Robustness and Vulnerability of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are useful descriptions of the structure of many complex systems. Unsurprisingly, it is thus important to analyze the robustness of networks in many scientific disciplines. In applications in communication, logistics, finance, ecology, biomedicine, and many other fields, researchers have studied the robustness of networks to the removal of nodes, edges, or other subnetworks to identify and characterize robust network structures. A major challenge in the study of network robustness is that researchers have reported that different and seemingly contradictory network properties are correlated with a network's robustness. Using a framework by Alderson and Doyle~\cite{Alderson2010}, we categorize several notions of network robustness and we examine these ostensible contradictions. We survey studies of network robustness with a focus on (1)~identifying robustness specifications in common use, (2)~understanding when these specifications are appropriate, and (3)~understanding the conditions under which one can expect different notions of robustness to yield similar results. With this review, we aim to give researchers an overview of the large, interdisciplinary body of work on network robustness and develop practical guidance for the design of computational experiments to study a network's robustness.</description>

      <title>Multivariate extensions of the Multilevel Best Linear Unbiased Estimator for ensemble-variational data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilevel estimators aim at reducing the variance of Monte Carlo statistical estimators, by combining samples generated with simulators of different costs and accuracies. In particular, the recent work of Schaden and Ullmann (2020) on the multilevel best linear unbiased estimator (MLBLUE) introduces a framework unifying several multilevel and multifidelity techniques. The MLBLUE is reintroduced here using a variance minimization approach rather than the regression approach of Schaden and Ullmann. We then discuss possible extensions of the scalar MLBLUE to a multidimensional setting, i.e. from the expectation of scalar random variables to the expectation of random vectors. Several estimators of increasing complexity are proposed: a) multilevel estimators with scalar weights, b) with element-wise weights, c) with spectral weights and d) with general matrix weights. The computational cost of each method is discussed. We finally extend the MLBLUE to the estimation of second-order moments in the multidimensional case, i.e. to the estimation of covariance matrices. The multilevel estimators proposed are d) a multilevel estimator with scalar weights and e) with element-wise weights. In large-dimension applications such as data assimilation for geosciences, the latter estimator is computationnally unaffordable. As a remedy, we also propose f) a multilevel covariance matrix estimator with optimal multilevel localization, inspired by the optimal localization theory of M\'en\'etrier and Aulign\'e (2015). Some practical details on weighted MLMC estimators of covariance matrices are given in appendix.</description>

      <title>Time Series of Magnetic Field Parameters of Merged MDI and HMI Space-Weather Active Region Patches as Potential Tool for Solar Flare Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar flare prediction studies have been recently conducted with the use of Space-Weather MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) Active Region Patches (SMARP) and Space-Weather HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory) Active Region Patches (SHARP), which are two currently available data products containing magnetic field characteristics of solar active regions. The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP with SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI-HMI dataset currently spans the period between April 4, 1996, and December 13, 2022, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Time-lagged cross-correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of active regions lead the flare index in time. Applying the rolling window technique makes it possible to see how this leader-follower dynamic varies with time. Preliminary results indicate that areas of high correlation generally correspond to increased flare activity during the peak solar cycle.</description>
