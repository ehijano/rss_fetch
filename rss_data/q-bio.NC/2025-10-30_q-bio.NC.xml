      <title>An in-silico integration of neurodevelopmental and dopaminergic views of schizophrenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have the potential to provide new insights into psychiatric disorders. Here we create a DRL model of schizophrenia: a complex psychotic disorder characterized by anhedonia, avoidance, temporal discounting, catatonia, and hallucinations. Schizophrenia's causes are not well understood: dopaminergic theories emphasize dopamine system dysfunction, while neurodevelopmental theories emphasize abnormal connectivity, including excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance in the brain. In this study, we suppressed positive (excitatory) connections within an artificial neural network to simulate E/I imbalance. Interestingly, this is insufficient to create behavioral changes; the network simply compensates for the imbalance. But in doing so it becomes more sensitive to noise. Injecting noise into the network then creates a range of schizophrenic-like behaviours. These findings point to an interesting potential pathology of schizophrenia: E/I imbalance leads to a compensatory response by the network to increase the excitability of neurons, which increases susceptibility to noise. This suggests that the combination of E/I imbalance and neural noise may be key in the emergence of schizophrenic symptoms. We further notice altered response to reward prediction error in our model, and thus propose that E/I imbalance plus noise can account for both schizophrenia symptoms and dopamine system dysfunction: potentially unifying dopaminergic and neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia pathology.</description>

      <title>Statistical Field Theory and Neural Structures Dynamics V: Synthesis and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified field-theoretic framework for the dynamics of activity and connectivity in interacting neuronal systems. Building upon previous works, where a field approach to activity--connectivity dynamics, formation of collective states and effective fields of collective states were successively introduced, the present paper synthesizes and extends these results toward a general description of multiple hierarchical collective structures. Starting with the dynamical system representing collective states in terms of connections, activity levels, and internal frequencies, we analyze its stability, emphasizing the possibility of transitions between configurations. Then, turning to the field formalism of collective states, we extend this framework to include substructures (subobjects) participating in larger assemblies while retaining intrinsic properties. We define activation classes describing compatible or independent activity patterns between objects and subobjects, and study stability conditions arising from their alignment or mismatch. The global system is described as the collection of landscapes of coexisting and interacting collective states, each characterized both by continuous (activity, frequency) and discrete (class) variables. A corresponding field formalism is developed, with an action functional incorporating both internal dynamics and interaction terms. This nonlinear field model captures cascading transitions between collective states and the formation of composite structures, providing a coherent theoretical basis for emergent neuronal assemblies and their mutual couplings.</description>

      <title>Effect of an auditory static distractor on the perception of an auditory moving target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25119v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that listeners lose the ability to discriminate the direction of motion of a revolving sound (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) beyond a critical velocity ("the upper limit"), primarily due to degraded front-back discrimination. Little is known about how this ability is affected by simultaneously present distractor sounds, despite the real-life importance of tracking moving sounds in the presence of distractors. We hypothesized that the presence of a static distractor sound would impair the perception of moving target sounds and reduce the upper limit, and show that this is indeed the case. A distractor on the right was as effective as a distractor at the front in reducing the upper limit despite the importance of resolving front-back confusions. By manipulating the spectral content of both the target and distractor, we found that the upper limit was reduced if and only if the distractor spectrally overlaps with the target in the frequency range relevant for front/back discrimination; energetic masking thus explains the upper limit reduction by the distractor. We did not find any evidence for informational masking by the distractor. Our findings form the first steps towards a better understanding of the tracking of multiple sounds in the presence of distractors.</description>

      <title>Decoding non-invasive brain activity with novel deep-learning approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work. A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.</description>

      <title>How can methods for classifying and clustering trajectories be used for prevention trials? An example in Alzheimer's disease area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Clinical trials are designed to prove the efficacy of an intervention by means of model-based approaches involving parametric hypothesis testing. Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population. Indeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot detect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm to a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another perspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of subjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which requires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account. The primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different methods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial with four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite Z-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic mixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is therefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory classification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal data, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised analysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status. Results: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and one of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up. This method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite Z-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised methods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore necessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the rate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation was performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the graphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define responder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria. Discussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be inconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have masked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta Amyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to subject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify patterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the potential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the final endpoint considered.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Chimeras States in One-dimensional Ising model with Long-Range Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.</description>

      <title>Scalable predictive processing framework for multitask caregiving robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Recurrent Ensembles for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Movies (Algonauts 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17897v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Conduction velocity of intracortical axons in monkey primary visual cortex grows with distance: implications for computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical visual computation is to construct global scene properties from activities of early visual cortical neurons which have small receptive fields. Such a computation is enabled by contextual influences, through which a neuron's response to visual inputs is influenced by contextual inputs outside its classical receptive fields. Accordingly, neurons can signal global properties including visual saliencies and figure-ground relationships. Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals too slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons. A popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback from higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields. This paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings: the conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly with the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual influences. Recognizing the importance of intracortical contribution to critical visual computations should enable fresh progress in answering long-standing questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <title>Explicitly Modeling Subcortical Vision with a Neuro-Inspired Front-End Improves CNN Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a front-end (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit stronger emergent shape bias and outperform the base CNN architecture by 9.3% on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data augmentation approach by 6.2% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology and training-based machine learning approaches.</description>
