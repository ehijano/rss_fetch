      <title>Final Search for Short-Baseline Neutrino Oscillations with the PROSPECT-I Detector at HFIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PROSPECT experiment is designed to perform precise searches for antineutrino disappearance at short distances (7 - 9~m) from compact nuclear reactor cores. This Letter reports results from a new neutrino oscillation analysis performed using the complete data sample from the PROSPECT-I detector operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in 2018. The analysis uses a multi-period selection of inverse beta decay neutrino interactions with reduced backgrounds and enhanced statistical power to set limits on electron-flavor disappearance caused by mixing with sterile neutrinos with 0.2 - 20 eV$^2$ mass splittings. Inverse beta decay positron energy spectra from six different reactor-detector distance ranges are found to be statistically consistent with one another, as would be expected in the absence of sterile neutrino oscillations. The data excludes at 95% confidence level the existence of sterile neutrinos in regions above 3~eV$^2$ previously unexplored by terrestrial experiments, including all space below 10~eV$^2$ suggested by the recently strengthened Gallium Anomaly. The best-fit point of the Neutrino-4 reactor experiment's claimed observation of short-baseline oscillation is ruled out at more than five standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of neutron identification in neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge in measurements of neutrino oscillations is reconstructing the incoming neutrino energies. While modern fully-active tracking calorimeters such as liquid argon time projection chambers in principle allow the measurement of all final state particles above some detection threshold, undetected neutrons remain a considerable source of missing energy with little to no data constraining their production rates and kinematics. We present the first demonstration of tagging neutrino-induced neutrons in liquid argon time projection chambers using secondary protons emitted from neutron-argon interactions in the MicroBooNE detector. We describe the method developed to identify neutrino-induced neutrons and demonstrate its performance using neutrons produced in muon-neutrino charged current interactions. The method is validated using a small subset of MicroBooNE's total dataset. The selection yields a sample with $60\%$ of selected tracks corresponding to neutron-induced secondary protons.</description>

      <title>Rare leptonic and semi-leptonic decays at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare leptonic and semi-leptonic decays offer an excellent opportunity to test the Standard Model of Particle Physics. These proceedings report on two recent LHCb measurements. The first is an observation of the rare $J/\psi \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay and the second is a comprehensive measurement of local and nonlocal contributions to the $B^0 \to K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay.</description>

      <title>Search for Majorana Neutrinos with the Complete KamLAND-Zen Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{136}$Xe using the full KamLAND-Zen 800 dataset with 745 kg of enriched xenon, corresponding to an exposure of $2.097$ ton yr of $^{136}$Xe. This updated search benefits from a more than twofold increase in exposure, recovery of photo-sensor gain, and reduced background from muon-induced spallation of xenon. Combining with the search in the previous KamLAND-Zen phase, we obtain a lower limit for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} &gt; 3.8 \times 10^{26}$ yr at 90% C.L., a factor of 1.7 improvement over the previous limit. The corresponding upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass are in the range 28-122 meV using phenomenological nuclear matrix element calculations.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production in $p+p$ and $p+d$ interactions at 120 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the $p+p$ and $p+d$ differential cross sections measured in the SeaQuest experiment for $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production at 120 GeV beam energy covering the forward $x$-Feynman ($x_F$) range of $0.5 &lt; x_F &lt;0.9$. The measured cross sections are in good agreement with theoretical calculations based on the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) using the long-distance matrix elements deduced from a recent global analysis of proton- and pion-induced charmonium production data. The $\sigma_{\psi\left(2S\right)} / \sigma_{J/\psi}$ cross section ratios are found to increase as $x_F$ increases, indicating that the $q \bar{q}$ annihilation process has larger contributions in the $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production than the $J/\psi$ production. The $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ cross section ratios are observed to be significantly different for the Drell-Yan process and $J/\psi$ production, reflecting their different production mechanisms. We find that the $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratios for $J/\psi$ production at the forward $x_F$ region are sensitive to the $\bar{d}/ \bar{u}$ flavor asymmetry of the proton sea, analogous to the Drell-Yan process. The transverse momentum ($p_T$) distributions for $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production are also presented and compared with data collected at higher center-of-mass energies.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments: Decision Trees versus Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of Dark Matter (DM) remains a significant challenge in particle physics. This study exploits advanced machine learning models to improve detection capabilities of liquid xenon time projection chamber experiments, utilizing state-of-the-art transformers alongside traditional methods like Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate various data representations and find that simplified feature representations, particularly corrected S1 and S2 signals, retain critical information for classification. Our results show that while transformers offer promising performance, simpler models like XGBoost can achieve comparable results with optimal data representations. We also derive exclusion limits in the cross-section versus DM mass parameter space, showing minimal differences between XGBoost and the best performing deep learning models. The comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches provides a valuable reference for future experiments by guiding the choice of models and data representations to maximize detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Multijet event shape variables for Mueller Navelet jet topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new set of multijet event shape variables introduced to further understand the Mueller-Navelet jet topology. This topology consists of having at least one pair of jets with a very large rapidity separation between them, treating additional jet activity inclusively. This multijet topology is expected to shed light on the radiation pattern that is expected in the high-energy limit of the strong interaction. The paper relies on a Monte Carlo event generator analysis. One set of predictions uses the BFKLex event generator, which is based on Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) evolution with a resummation of large logarithms of energy at leading-logarithmic accuracy. The BFKLex predictions are compared with a fixed-order next-to-leading order pQCD calculation using POWHEG matched to the parton shower of PYTHIA8 (NLO+PS), which is the standard for NLO generator predictions at the LHC. We find that both approaches lead to compatible results at current LHC energies, assuming the current experimental constraints for the reconstruction of low transverse momentum jets in ATLAS and CMS. This shows the reliability of the BFKL approach at describing the behavior of the strong interaction in the preasymptotic limit of high center-of-mass energies. Differences between the NLO+PS and the BFKL-based approaches are found when the jet multiplicity is increased or when the minimum transverse momentum of the jets is decreased.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium fragmentation in a variable-flavor number scheme: Towards NRFF1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report progress on the determination and study of quarkonium production within the fragmentation approximation. Our analyses address the moderate and large transverse-momentum regime, where the collinear fragmentation of a single parton is expected to dominate over the short-distance production, directly from the hard scattering, of the constituent $(Q \bar{Q})$ system. Parton fragmentation channels to pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia are built on the basis of non-Relativistic QCD next-to-leading computations, which we use to model initial-scale fragmentation inputs. Thus, a preliminary family of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are constructed through standard DGLAP evolution. Statistical uncertainties are obtained from a Monte Carlo, replica-like approach embodying missing higher-order uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A systematic investigation on dark matter-electron scattering in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the general dark matter-electron interactions within the framework of effective field theories (EFT). We consider both the non-relativistic (NR) EFT and the relativistic EFT descriptions of the interactions with the spin of dark matter (DM) up to one, i.e., the scalar ($\phi$), fermion ($\chi$), and vector $(X)$ DM scenarios. We first collect the leading-order NR EFT operators describing the DM-electron interactions, and construct especially the NR operators for the vector DM case. Next, we consider all possible leading-order relativistic EFT operators including those with a photon field and perform the NR reduction to match them onto the NR EFT. Then we rederive the DM-bound-electron scattering rate within the NR EFT framework and find that the matrix element squared, which is the key input that encodes the DM and atomic information, can be compactly decomposed into three terms. Each term is a product of a DM response function $(a_{0,1,2})$, which is essentially a factor of Wilson coefficients squared, and its corresponding generalized atomic response function ($\widetilde W_{0,1,2}$). Lastly, we employ the electron recoil data from the DM direct detection experiments (including XENON10, XENON1T, and PandaX-4T) to constrain all the non-relativistic and relativistic operators in all three DM scenarios. We set strong bounds on the DM-electron interactions in the sub-GeV region. Particularly, we find that the latest PandaX-4T S2-only data provide stringent constraints on dark matter with a mass greater than approximately 20 MeV, surpassing those from the previous XENON10 and XENON1T experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the $\Upsilon$-, $\eta_b$- and $B_c$-nucleus systems in momentum space to calculate the bound-state energies and the corresponding coordinate space radial wave functions. A comparison is made among different methods to obtain the partial wave decomposition of meson-nucleus potentials in momentum space, namely, (i) the spherical Bessel transform of the numerically obtained original potential in coordinate space, (ii) the partial wave decomposition of the Fourier transform of the Woods-Saxon approximated form for the original potential, and (iii) the spherical Bessel transform of the Woods-Saxon approximation of the numerically obtained original potential. The strong nuclear bound-state energies for the $\Upsilon$-$^{4}$He, $\Upsilon$-$^{12}$C, $\eta_b$-$^{4}$He, $\eta_b$-$^{12}$C, $B_c$-$^{4}$He (no Coulomb), and $B_c$-$^{12}$C (no Coulomb) systems and the corresponding wave functions in coordinate space are compared for the three methods. Furthermore, as an initial and realistic study, the $B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C bound states are studied for the first time, with the effects of self-consistently calculated Coulomb potentials in $^{12}$C (when the $B_c^{\pm}$ mesons are absent).</description>

      <title>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in ALP effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay is an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the SM in future neutrino experiments with enhanced sensitivity. The dark sector states such as an axion or axion-like particle (ALP) can induce nucleon decays with distinct signature and kinematics from the conventional nucleon decays. In this work, we study the ALP effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light ALP on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-8 BNV operators in the extended EFTs with an ALP field $a$ respecting shift symmetry. The low-energy EFT operators with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ and $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$ are matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian and the BNV interactions between ALP and baryons/mesons. The ALP interactions lead to two-body baryon decays $B\to \ell~({\rm or}~\nu)~a$ and three-body nucleon decays $N\to M~\ell~({\rm or}~\nu)~a$. We obtain the constraints on the UV scale from the invisible $\Lambda^0$ decay search at BESIII, the invisible neutron decay search at KamLAND and proton decay search at Super-K. We also show the projections of some other baryon/nucleon decays and present the distinct distributions of kinematic observable.</description>

      <title>Tri-boson and WH production in the $\mathrm{W}^+\mathrm{W}^+\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}$ channel: predictions at full NLO accuracy and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first full NLO predictions for the process $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu\mathrm{e}^+\nu_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}$ at the LHC in a typical tri-boson phase space. The NLO corrections reach 50% at the level of the fiducial cross section and have a very different hierarchy with respect to vector-boson-scattering phase spaces. By comparing the cross section of the full off-shell process with the sum of contributing on-shell electroweak-boson production subchannels, we find that the process is dominated by WWW and WH production, while vector-boson-scattering topologies still play a non-negligible role. In addition, NLO QCD predictions matched to parton shower which are supplemented by approximate electroweak corrections are provided. For the fiducial cross section, the electroweak corrections turn out to be small but the QCD corrections reach 47%. For the inclusive cross section, matching to parton shower affects the predictions by 7%. However, for differential distributions corrections due to the parton shower can be much more sizeable, depending on the region of phase space.</description>

      <title>Neutron Production in Simulations of Extensive Air Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers have been studied in great detail, no comprehensive simulation study of the neutron component is available. This is related to the complexity of neutron transport processes that is typically not treated in standard simulation tools. In this work we use the Monte Carlo simulation package Fluka to study the production and the transport of neutrons in extensive air showers over the full range of neutron energies, extending down to thermal neutrons. The importance of different neutron production mechanisms and their impact on predicted neutron distributions in energy, lateral distance, atmospheric depth, and arrival time are discussed. In addition, the dependencies of the predictions on the properties of the primary particle are studied. The results are compared to the equivalent distributions of muons, which serve as reference.</description>

      <title>Search for baryon number violation in top quark production and decay using proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is presented for baryon number violating interactions in top quark production and decay. The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Candidate events are selected by requiring two oppositely-charged leptons (electrons or muons) and exactly one jet identified as originating from a bottom quark. Multivariate discriminants are used to separate the signal from the background. No significant deviation from the standard model prediction is observed. Upper limits are placed on the strength of baryon number violating couplings. For the first time the production of single top quarks via baryon number violating interactions is studied. This allows the search to set the most stringent constraints to date on the branching fraction of the top quark decay to a lepton, an up-type quark (u or c), and a down-type quark (d, s, or b). The results improve the previous bounds by three to six orders of magnitude based on the fermion flavor combination of the baryon number violating interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the improvement of muon acceleration technology, it has received great interest to exploit high-energy muon beams for collision or target experiments. We investigate possible charged Lepton Flavor Violation (cLFV) processes mediated by an extra massive neutral gauge boson Zprime in electron muon interactions, either at a proposed electron muon collider or in a fixed target experiment with high-energy muon beam hitting electrons in the target. Based on Monte Carlo calculations and fast detector simulations, we study in detail our signal and possible backgrounds, giving the sensitivity results of cLFV signals at the 90% confidence level. Compared with current and prospective limits set by other experiments, electron muon interactions demonstrate significant advantages in the cLFV coupling strength sensitivity with tau in the final states. In addition, a special cLFV coupling combination, lambda_emu * lambda_mumu, can also be probed in our proposal.</description>

      <title>Background Modeling for Double Higgs Boson Production: Density Ratios and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of data-driven background estimation, arising in the search of physics signals predicted by the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Our work is motivated by the search for the production of pairs of Higgs bosons decaying into four bottom quarks. A number of other physical processes, known as background, also share the same final state. The data arising in this problem is therefore a mixture of unlabeled background and signal events, and the primary aim of the analysis is to determine whether the proportion of unlabeled signal events is nonzero. A challenging but necessary first step is to estimate the distribution of background events. Past work in this area has determined regions of the space of collider events where signal is unlikely to appear, and where the background distribution is therefore identifiable. The background distribution can be estimated in these regions, and extrapolated into the region of primary interest using transfer learning with a multivariate classifier. We build upon this existing approach in two ways. First, we revisit this method by developing a customized residual neural network which is tailored to the structure and symmetries of collider data. Second, we develop a new method for background estimation, based on the optimal transport problem, which relies on modeling assumptions distinct from earlier work. These two methods can serve as cross-checks for each other in particle physics analyses, due to the complementarity of their underlying assumptions. We compare their performance on simulated double Higgs boson data.</description>

      <title>Searching for light neutralinos with a displaced vertex at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a bino-like light neutralino ($\tilde \chi_1^0$) produced at the LHC from the decay of a scalar lepton ($\tilde e_L$) through the process $pp\to \tilde e_{L} \to e\tilde \chi_1^0$ in the context of R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetry where $\tilde \chi_1^0$ is the lightest supersymmetric particle. For small masses and RPV couplings, the neutralino is naturally long-lived and its decay products can be identified as displaced tracks. Following existing searches, we propose a displaced-vertex search strategy for such a light neutralino with a single RPV coupling switched on, $\lambda'_{111}$, in the mass range $10\,\mbox{GeV} \lesssim m_{\tilde \chi_1^0}\lesssim 230\,\mbox{GeV}$. We perform Monte Carlo simulations and conclude that at the high-luminosity LHC, the proposed search can probe values of $\lambda'_{111}$ down to two orders of magnitude smaller than current bounds and up to 40 times stronger than projected limits from monolepton searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Standard Model fit to electroweak precision observables using the latest data and the Particle Data Group value of the mass of the W boson. This analysis is repeated for the value reported by CDF. The constraints on the parameter space for dark photons arising from these electroweak precision observables are then evaluated for both values of the W boson mass. We also extend previous work by placing the first electroweak precision observable constraints on the coupling of dark photons to the fermionic dark matter sector.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical generation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $B_{s0}^*$ mesons using a meson-exchange model with a coupled-channelformalism. Our primary focus is on the $D_s^+\pi^0$ channel below the $DK$ threshold. First, we construct the invariant kernel amplitudes, incorporating effective Lagrangians based on heavy-quark symmetry, flavor SU(3) symmetry, and hidden local symmetry. Since the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ state implies isospin symmetry breaking, we introduce $\pi^0-\eta$ isospin mixing. We subsequently solve the coupled-channel integral equations, which include four different channels, i.e., $D_s^+\pi^0$, $D^0 K^+$, $D^+ K^0$, and $D_s^+\eta$. We carefully analyze how the pole corresponding to the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ state emerges from the coupled channels. Our findings reveal that the pole positions of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson are at $\sqrt{s_R}=(2317.9 - i 0.0593)$ MeV and the $\bar{B}_{s0}^*$ meson at $(5756.43-i0.0215)$ MeV, respectively. We also discuss their decay widths and destructive interference of the two sources. In conclusion, our current results provide a clear indication supporting the interpretation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson as a $DK$ molecular state within the present coupled-channel formalism. In addition, we discuss a possible existence of $\bar{B}_{s0}^{*}$.</description>

      <title>Study of a cubic cavity resonator for gravitational waves detection in the microwave frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of frequencies above MHz has recently received considerable attention. In this work we present a precise study of the reach of a cubic cavity resonator to GWs in the microwave range, using for the first time tools allowing to perform realistic simulations. Concretely, the BI-RME 3D method, which allows us to obtain not only the detected power but also the detected voltage (magnitude and phase), is used here. After analyzing three cubic cavities for different frequencies and working simultaneously with three different degenerate modes at each cavity, we conclude that the sensitivity of the experiment is strongly dependent on the polarization and incidence angle of the GW. The presented experiment can reach sensitivities up to $ 1 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 100\, MHz, $ 2 \cdot 10^{-20}$ at 1\, GHz, and $ 6 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 10\, GHz for optimal angles and polarizations, and where in all cases we assumed an integration time of $\Delta t = 1$ ms. These results provide a strong case for further developing the use of cavities to detect GWs. Moreover, the possibility of analyzing the detected voltage (magnitude and phase) opens a new interferometric detection scheme based on the combination of the detected signals from multiple cavities.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the isospin eigenstate $\bar D \Sigma_c$, $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$, and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks by their electromagnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To shed light on the nature of the controversial and not yet fully understood exotic states, we are carrying out a systematic study of their electromagnetic properties. The magnetic moment of a hadron state is as fundamental a dynamical quantity as its mass and contains valuable information on the deep underlying structure. In this study, we use the QCD light-cone sum rule to extract the magnetic moments of the $\mathrm{P_{c}(4312)}$, $\mathrm{P_{c}(4380)}$, and $\mathrm{P_{c}(4440)}$ pentaquarks by considering them as the molecular picture with spin-parity $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{1}{2}^-}$, $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, and $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, respectively. We define the isospin of the interpolating currents of these states, which is the key to solving the puzzle of the hidden-charm pentaquark states, to make these analyses more precise and reliable. We have compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for the interpretation of the hidden-charm pentaquark sector, and we observe that they are not in mutual agreement with each other. We have also calculated higher multipole moments for spin-3/2 $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks, indicating a non-spherical charge distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Primakoff process plays a crucial role in axion production in astrophysical environments and laboratories. Given the rising interest in axion physics and many on-going experimental activities, we conduct a comprehensive calculation of this process and carefully examine several aspects that have been neglected in the literature. In particular, our calculation is valid for axions with significantly large masses, which would be of importance to axion searches utilizing crystal and liquid xenon detectors. We present the most updated calculation of the Primakoff solar axion flux, with a simple parametrization that is applicable to a broad range of axion masses up to a few tens of keV. Our code is publicly available at GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PandaX-4T experiment is a deep-underground dark matter direct search experiment that employs a dual-phase time projection chamber with a sensitive volume containing 3.7 tonne of liquid xenon. The detector of PandaX-4T is capable of simultaneously collecting the primary scintillation and ionization signals, utilizing their ratio to discriminate dark matter signals from background sources such as gamma rays and beta particles. The signal response model plays a crucial role in interpreting the data obtained by PandaX-4T. It describes the conversion from the deposited energy by dark matter interactions to the detectable signals within the detector. The signal response model is utilized in various PandaX-4T results. This work provides a comprehensive description of the procedures involved in constructing and parameter-fitting the signal response model for the energy range of approximately 1 keV to 25 keV for electronic recoils and 6 keV to 90 keV for nuclear recoils. It also covers the signal reconstruction, selection, and correction methods, which are crucial components integrated into the signal response model.</description>

      <title>Deep Probabilistic Direction Prediction in 3D with Applications to Directional Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first method to probabilistically predict 3D direction in a deep neural network model. The probabilistic predictions are modeled as a heteroscedastic von Mises-Fisher distribution on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, giving a simple way to quantify aleatoric uncertainty. This approach generalizes the cosine distance loss which is a special case of our loss function when the uncertainty is assumed to be uniform across samples. We develop approximations required to make the likelihood function and gradient calculations stable. The method is applied to the task of predicting the 3D directions of electrons, the most complex signal in a class of experimental particle physics detectors designed to demonstrate the particle nature of dark matter and study solar neutrinos. Using simulated Monte Carlo data, the initial direction of recoiling electrons is inferred from their tortuous trajectories, as captured by the 3D detectors. For $40\,$keV electrons in a $70\%$ $\textrm{He}$ $30 \%$ $\textrm{CO}_2$ gas mixture at STP, the new approach achieves a mean cosine distance of $0.104$ ($26^\circ$) compared to $0.556$ ($64^\circ$) achieved by a non-machine learning algorithm. We show that the model is well-calibrated and accuracy can be increased further by removing samples with high predicted uncertainty. This advancement in probabilistic 3D directional learning could increase the sensitivity of directional dark matter detectors.</description>

      <title>Enforcing exact permutation and rotational symmetries in the application of quantum neural network on point cloud datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the field of quantum machine learning have promoted the idea of incorporating physical symmetries in the structure of quantum circuits. A crucial milestone in this area is the realization of $S_{n}$-permutation equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) that are equivariant under permutations of input objects. In this work, we focus on encoding the rotational symmetry of point cloud datasets into the QNN. The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products. We provide a novel structure of QNN that is exactly invariant to both rotations and permutations, with its efficacy demonstrated numerically in the problems of two-dimensional image classifications and identifying high-energy particle decays, produced by proton-proton collisions, with the $SO(1,3)$ Lorentz symmetry.</description>

We performed test experiments using quasi-mono energetic neutron beams ($E_n = 30$ and 250~MeV) at Osaka University's Research Center for Nuclear Physics to measure $\gamma$-rays originating from the neutron-oxygen reaction with a high-purity germanium detector. Multiple $\gamma$-ray peaks which are expected to be from excited nuclei after the neutron-oxygen reaction were successfully observed. We measured the neutron beam flux by using a liquid scintillator for the cross section measurement. With a spectral fitting analysis based on the tailored $\gamma$-ray signal and background templates, we measured cross sections for each observed $\gamma$-ray component. The results will be useful to validate neutron models employed in the on-going and future water Cherenkov experiments.</description>
