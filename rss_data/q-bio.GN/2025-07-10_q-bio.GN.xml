      <title>Mix-Geneformer: Unified Representation Learning for Human and Mouse scRNA-seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables single-cell transcriptomic profiling, revealing cellular heterogeneity and rare populations. Recent deep learning models like Geneformer and Mouse-Geneformer perform well on tasks such as cell-type classification and in silico perturbation. However, their species-specific design limits cross-species generalization and translational applications, which are crucial for advancing translational research and drug discovery. We present Mix-Geneformer, a novel Transformer-based model that integrates human and mouse scRNA-seq data into a unified representation via a hybrid self-supervised approach combining Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and SimCSE-based contrastive loss to capture both shared and species-specific gene patterns. A rank-value encoding scheme further emphasizes high-variance gene signals during training. Trained on about 50 million cells from diverse human and mouse organs, Mix-Geneformer matched or outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type classification and in silico perturbation tasks, achieving 95.8% accuracy on mouse kidney data versus 94.9% from the best existing model. It also successfully identified key regulatory genes validated by in vivo studies. By enabling scalable cross-species transcriptomic modeling, Mix-Geneformer offers a powerful tool for comparative transcriptomics and translational applications. While our results demonstrate strong performance, we also acknowledge limitations, such as the computational cost and variability in zero-shot transfer.</description>

      <title>Widespread remote introgression in the grass genomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic transfers are pervasive across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, encompassing canonical genomic introgression between species or genera and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) across kingdoms. However, DNA transfer between phylogenetically distant species, here defined as remote introgression (RI), has remained poorly explored in evolutionary genomics. In this study, we present RIFinder, a novel phylogeny-based method for RI event detection, and apply it to a comprehensive dataset of 122 grass genomes. Our analysis identifies 622 RI events originating from 543 distinct homologous genes, revealing distinct characteristics among grass subfamilies. Specifically, the subfamily Pooideae exhibits the highest number of introgressed genes while Bambusoideae contains the lowest. Comparisons among accepted genes, their donor copies and native homologs demonstrate that introgressed genes undergo post-transfer localized adaptation, with significant functional enrichment in stress-response pathways. Notably, we identify a large Triticeae-derived segment in a Chloridoideae species Cleistogenes songorica, which is potentially associated with its exceptional drought tolerance. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that RI has contributed to the origin and diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters of gramine, a defensive alkaloid chemical, across grass species. Collectively, our study establishes a robust method for RI detection and highlights its critical role in adaptive evolution.</description>

      <title>Motif Caller: Sequence Reconstruction for Motif-Based DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA data storage is rapidly emerging as a promising solution for long-term data archiving, largely due to its exceptional durability. However, the synthesis of DNA strands remains a significant bottleneck in terms of cost and speed. To address this, new methods have been developed that encode information by concatenating long data-carrying DNA sequences from pre-synthesized DNA subsequences - known as motifs - from a library.
  Reading back data from DNA storage relies on basecalling - the process of translating raw nanopore sequencing signals into DNA base sequences using machine learning models. These sequences are then decoded back into binary data. However, current basecalling approaches are not optimized for decoding motif-carrying DNA: they first predict individual bases from the raw signal and only afterward attempt to identify higher-level motifs. This two-step, motif-agnostic process is both imprecise and inefficient.
  In this paper we introduce Motif Caller, a machine learning model designed to directly detect entire motifs from raw nanopore signals, bypassing the need for intermediate basecalling. By targeting motifs directly, Motif Caller leverages richer signal features associated with each motif, resulting in significantly improved accuracy. This direct approach also enhances the efficiency of data retrieval in motif-based DNA storage systems.</description>
