      <title>Regulating Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Finance for an Inclusive Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) marks a significant shift in the financial landscape, making it more accessible, inclusive, and participative for various societal groups. However, this transition from traditional financial institutions to DeFi demands a meticulous policy framework that strikes a balance between innovation and safeguarding consumer interests, security, and regulatory compliance. In this script we explore the imperative need for regulatory frameworks overseeing cryptocurrencies and DeFi, aiming to leverage their potential for inclusive economic advancement. It underscores the prevalent challenges within conventional financial systems, juxtaposing them with the transformative potential offered by these emergent financial paradigms. By highlighting the role of robust regulations, we examine their capacity to ensure user security, fortify market resilience, and spur innovative strides. We aim to proffer viable strategies for formulating regulatory structures that harmonize the twin objectives of fostering innovation and upholding fairness within financial ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Household Leverage Cycle Around the Great Recession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first causal evidence that credit supply expansion caused the 1999-2010 U.S. business cycle mainly through the channel of household leverage (debt-to-income ratio). Specifically, induced by net export growth, credit expansion in private-label mortgages, rather than government-sponsored enterprise mortgages, causes a much stronger boom and bust cycle in household leverage in the high net-export-growth areas. In addition, such a stronger household leverage cycle creates a stronger boom and bust cycle in the local economy, including housing prices, residential construction investment, and house-related employment. Thus, our results are consistent with the credit-driven household demand channel (Mian and Sufi, 2018). Further, we show multiple pieces of evidence against the corporate channel, which is emphasized by other business cycle theories (hypotheses).</description>
