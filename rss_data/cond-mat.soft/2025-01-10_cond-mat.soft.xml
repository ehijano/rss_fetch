      <title>Microscopic structure and dynamics of shear-thinning suspensions of polydisperse, repulsive vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the rheology, microscopic structure, and dynamics of an industrially relevant dispersion made of cationic surfactant vesicles, from dilute to concentrated conditions. We find that these suspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively low concentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-defined transition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak in the static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down and develop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. This low-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light of experiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar composition the interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to propose that the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as an entropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled to crowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as the nonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow. Our work suggests that similar effects might be a generic feature of dense, highly polydisperse charged suspensions.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram, confining strings, and a new universality class in nematopolar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a minimal model of a system with coexisting nematic and polar orientational orders, where one field tends to order and the other prefers isotropy. For strong coupling, the ordered field aligns the isotropic one, locking their orientations. The phase diagram reveals three distinct phases--nematopolar (aligned orders), nematic (independent orders), and isotropic (vanishing orders)--separated by continuous and discontinuous transitions, including a triple and a tricritical point. We find unique critical scaling for the nematopolar-nematic transition, distinct from standard nematic or polar universality classes. Additionally, in the locked nematopolar phase, we show nematic $+1/2$ topological defect pairs are connected and confined by strings with constant tension. These strings arise from frustration in locking the orientational orders and can be interpreted as elongated cores of $+1$ polar topological defects. When a sufficiently strong background field couples to the polar order, all topological defects are expelled from the region. Analytical predictions are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A phase-field model for DNA self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase-field model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation to investigate the kinetics of phase separation in DNA nanostar systems. Leveraging a realistic free-energy functional derived from Wertheim theory, our model captures the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of self-assembling DNA nanostars under various conditions. This approach allows for the study of both one-component and multi-component systems, including mixtures of different nanostar species and cross-linkers. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the model ability to replicate experimental observations, including liquid-liquid phase separation, surface tension variation, and the structural organization of multi-component systems. Our results highlight the versatility and predictive power of the Cahn-Hilliard framework, particularly for complex systems where detailed simulations are computationally prohibitive. This work provides a robust foundation for studying DNA-based materials and their potential applications in nanotechnology and biophysics, including liquid-liquid phase separation in cellular environments.</description>

      <title>Training Allostery-Inspired Mechanical Response in Disordered Elastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered elastic networks are a model material system in which it is possible to achieve tunable and trainable functions. This work investigates the modification of local mechanical properties in disordered networks inspired by allosteric interactions in proteins: applying strain locally to a set of source nodes triggers a strain response at a distant set of target nodes. This is demonstrated first by using directed aging to modify the existing mechanical coupling between pairs of distant source and target nodes, and later as a means for inducing coupling between formerly isolated source-target pairs. The experimental results are compared with those predicted by simulations.</description>

      <title>Stability of a passive viscous droplet in a confined active nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Finite strain continuum phenomenological model describing the shape-memory effects in multi-phase semi-crystalline networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally-driven semi-crystalline polymer networks are capable to achieve both the one-way shape-memory effect and two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions, therefore representing an appealing class of polymers for applications requiring autonomous reversible actuation and shape changes. In these materials, the shape-memory effects are achieved by leveraging the synergistic interaction between one or more crystalline phases and the surrounding amorphous ones that are present within the network itself. The present paper introduces a general framework for the finite strain continuum phenomenological modeling of the thermo-mechanical and shape-memory behavior of multi-phase semi-crystalline polymer networks. Model formulation, including the definition of phase and control variables, kinematic assumptions, and constitutive specifications, is introduced and thoroughly discussed. Theoretical derivations are general and easily adaptable to all cross-linked systems which include two or more crystalline domains or a single crystalline phase with a wide melting range and manifest macroscopically the one-way shape-memory effect and the two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions. Model capabilities are validated against experimental data for copolymer networks with two different crystalline phases characterized by well-separated melting and crystallization transitions. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting all the phenomena involved and in furnishing a useful support for future material and application design purposes.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Particle Collision Framework for Active Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficiently dense intrinsically out-of-equilibrium suspensions, such as those observed in biological systems, can be modelled as active fluids characterised by their orientational symmetry. While mesoscale numerical approaches to active nematic fluids have been developed, polar fluids are simulated as either ensembles of microscopic self-propelled particles or continuous hydrodynamic-scale equations of motion. To better simulate active polar fluids in complex geometries or as a solvent for suspensions, mesoscale numerical approaches are needed. In this work, the coarse-graining Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) framework is applied to three active particle models to produce mesoscale simulations of polar active fluids. The first active-polar MPCD (AP-MPCD) is a variant of the Vicsek model, while the second and third variants allow the speed of the particles to relax towards a self-propulsion speed subject to Andersen and Langevin thermostats, respectively. Each of these AP-MPCD variants exhibit a flocking transition at a critical activity and banding in the vicinity of the transition point. We leverage the mesoscale nature of AP-MPCD to explore flocking in the presence of external fields, which destroys banding, and anisotropic obstacles, which act as a ratchet that biases the flocking direction. These results demonstrate the capacity of AP-MPCD to capture the known phenomenology of polar active suspensions, and its versatility to study active polar fluids in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Force-Velocity Relationship in Branched Actin Networks: Consequences of Entanglement, Drag and Stall Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of a branched actin network under load. Using a combination of simulations and theory, we show that the network adapts to the load and exhibits two regimes: a finite velocity at low stress, followed by a power-law decay of the velocity as a function of stress. This decay is explained by a theoretical model relating branched network elasticity to filament entanglement. The finite maximum velocity is attributed to network drag, which dictates dynamics at low stress. Additionally, analysis of filament stall force contribution reveals a transition from a stalled network to a growing network, when the filament stall force exceeds a critical value controlled by the applied stress.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusion in isotropic and liquid crystalline phases of fd virus colloidal rods: a combined single particle tracking and differential dynamic microscopy study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the dynamics of self-organised suspensions formed by rod-like fd virus colloids. Two methods have been employed for analysing fluorescence microscopy movies: single particle tracking (SPT) in direct space and differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) in reciprocal space. We perform a quantitative analysis on this anisotropic system with complex diffusion across different self-assembled states, ranging from dilute and semi-dilute liquids to nematic and smectic organisations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of SPT and DDM, we provide new insights in the dynamics of viral colloidal rods, such as long time diffusion coefficients in the smectic phase. We further discuss the advantages and limitations of both methods for studying the intricate dynamics of anisotropic colloidal systems.</description>

      <title>Self-propulsion and self-rotation of an inertial chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport feature of an inertial chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle moving on a two-dimensional surface. Using both analytical approach and numerical simulations, we have exactly explored the transient and steady-state behavior of the particle by analyzing the simulated particle trajectories, probability distribution functions for position and velocity, mean square displacement, mean square velocity, and effective kinetic temperature of the medium. From the mean square displacement calculations, we observe that, unlike an inertial active Brownian particle, a chiral active particle manifests an initial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive, and the conventional long-time diffusive behavior. The intermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive behavior is prominent for the self-propulsion of an overdamped particle. It can be understood by chirality-induced transient confinement, which persists for short time intervals and diffuses away in the time asymptotic limit or at the steady state. This behavior is further complemented by the exact calculation of mean square velocity or effective kinetic temperature of the medium, which is a decreasing function of the magnitude of chirality. Moreover, the steady-state MSD and MSV are found to have a dependence both on chirality and activity time scale and hence can be controlled by tuning the persistent duration of activity or strength of the chirality of the particle.</description>

      <title>Active Microrheology and Dynamic Phases for Pattern Forming Systems with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the driven dynamics of a probe particle moving through an assembly of particles with competing long-range repulsive and short-range attractive interactions, which form crystal, stripe, labyrinth, and bubble states as the ratio of attraction to repulsion is varied. We show that the probe particle exhibits a depinning-like threshold from an elastic regime, where the probe particle is trapped by interactions with the other particles, to a plastic flow regime, where the probe particle can break bonds in the surrounding medium. For a fixed particle density, the depinning threshold and sliding velocity of the probe particle vary nonmonotonically as the attraction term is increased. A velocity minimum appears near the crystal to stripe crossover, and there is a significant increase in the depinning threshold in the bubble regime when the probe particle is strongly confined inside the bubbles. For fixed attractive interaction but increasing particle density, the behavior is also nonmonotonic and there are jumps and drops in the velocity and depinning threshold corresponding to points at which the system transitions between different structures. There are also several distinct flow states that can be characterized by the amount of plastic deformation induced by the probe particle in the surrounding medium. Each flow state generates a different amount of effective drag on the probe particle, and there can be jumps in the velocity-force curve at transitions between the states. We also find that when oriented stripes are present, the probe particle can move along the stripe in an edge transport state that has a finite Hall angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become an indispensable tool for investigating mesoscopic features in soft matter and fluid mechanics. Its ability to provide high-resolution, non-invasive measurements in both spatial and temporal domains bridges critical gaps in experimental instrumentation, enabling the study of complex, confined, and dynamic systems. This review serves as both an introduction to OCT and a practical guide for researchers seeking to adopt this technology. A set of tutorials, complemented by Python scripts, are provided for both intensity- and Doppler-based techniques. The versatility of OCT is illustrated through case studies, including time-resolved velocimetry, particle-based velocity measurements, slip velocity characterization, detection of shear-induced structures, and analysis of fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interactions. Drawing on our experiences, we also present a set of practical guidelines for avoiding common pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Stability Exchange near Folds: Analysis of an end-loaded Elastica with a Lever Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous problems in physical sciences can be expressed as parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated family of equilibria may or may not exist realistically and can be determined after examining its stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track its transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near the folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability change can be encoded through a particular projection of the solutions. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends, a class of problems frequently found in mechanics. Using the developed theory, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. The examples revealed several instances of snap-back instability in these systems. These findings may aid in enhancing the design of soft robot arms and other innovative switching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Energy Dynamics Powered by Traction and Stress Control Formation and Motion of +1/2 Topological Defects in Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion occurring at the same time in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity within the epithelial cell monolayer, with their competition defining whether the cells inject or dissipate energy and determining the direction of motion of +1/2 defects. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings reverse the current picture, from one in which defects define the cell forces and motion to one in which coordinated patterns of cell forces and motion cause defects to form and move.</description>

      <title>A Cold Tracer in a Hot Bath: In and Out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature overdamped tracer in a bath of Brownian particles. As the bath density is increased, the passive tracer transitions from an effectively active dynamics, characterized by boundary accumulation and ratchet currents, to a bona-fide equilibrium regime. To account for this, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom under the assumption of linear coupling to the tracer and show convergence to equilibrium in the large density limit. We then develop a perturbation theory to characterize the tracer's departure from equilibrium at large but finite bath densities, revealing an intermediate time-reversible yet non-Boltzmann regime, followed by a fully irreversible one. Finally, we show that when the bath particles are connected as a lattice, mimicking a gel, the cold tracer drives the entire bath out of equilibrium, leading to a long-ranged suppression of bath fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Three Simple Stokeslet Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact results for three trajectories of small numbers of particles interacting hydrodynamically through Stokeslets are presented. First, the middle particle in a vertical trio of particles sediments at a constant velocity for all time. Second, a horizontal pair of particles sedimenting toward a rigid wall undergo a finite and surprisingly constant horizontal displacement in the limit of large initial separations. Third, a pair of particles sedimenting in a quadratic flow, such as that of a fluid pumped in the direction of gravity, oscillates in a periodic orbit and admits a Hamiltonian formulation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic active Brownian particle in two dimensions under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the dynamic behavior of an an-isotropic active Brownian particle under various stochastic resetting protocols in two dimensions. The motion of shape-asymmetric active Brownian particles in two dimensions leads to an-isotropic diffusion at short times, whereas rotational diffusion causes the transport to become isotropic at longer times. We have considered three different resetting protocols: (a) complete resetting, when both position and orientation are reset to their initial states, (b) only position is reset to its initial state, (c) only orientation is reset to its initial state. We reveal that orientation resetting sustains asymmetry even at late times. When both the spatial position and orientation are subject to resetting, a complex position probability distribution forms in the steady state. All the analytical findings are thoroughly validated by corresponding simulation results.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition: A perspective</title>

Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone &amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson &amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>On modeling fracture of soft polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft polymers are ubiquitous materials in nature and as engineering materials with properties varying from rate-independent to rate-dependent depending on the crosslinking mechanisms. Current fracture toughness measures are non-unique for rate-dependent soft materials for varying loading profiles and specimen geometries. Works on modeling fracture in rate-dependent soft polymers are limited to specific pre-cracked geometries. There is no generally agreed-upon model for the fracture of soft polymers. We propose and show that a critical value of stress work $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ obtained from simple homogeneous deformation experiments can be used as a simple experimental scalar measure of fracture resistance in soft polymers. We also develop a damage model to predict fracture in soft polymers through a generalized gradient damage framework based on the method of virtual power. The energetic part of the critical stress work is proposed as a damage initiation criterion. In the model, material strength, which is an important component of phase field damage models, is explicitly accounted for. The fracture model is validated and demonstrated to work well for both elastomers and viscous soft polymers by comparing model predictions against experimental results for different materials (ethylene propylene diene monomer - EPDM, EPS25 vitrimer, styrene butadiene rubber - SBR, and polyborosiloxane - PBS), a variety of specimen geometries, and loading conditions. The model is able to predict key physical phenomena and microstructural physical quantities, such as subchain dissociation energy during the fracture of soft polymers.</description>

      <title>3D Printing of Near-Ambient Responsive Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Enhanced Nematic Order and Pluralized Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid Crystal Elastomers with near-ambient temperature-responsiveness (NAT-LCEs) have been extensively studied for building bio-compatible, low-power consumption devices and robotics. However, conventional manufacturing methods face limitations in programmability (e.g., molding) or low nematic order (e.g., DIW printing). Here, a hybrid cooling strategy is proposed for programmable 3D printing of NAT-LCEs with enhanced nematic order, intricate shape forming, and morphing capability. By integrating a low-temperature nozzle and a cooling platform into a 3D printer, the resulting temperature field synergistically facilitates mesogen alignment during extrusion and disruption-free UV cross-linking. This method achieves a nematic order 3000% higher than NAT-LCEs fabricated using traditional room temperature 3D printing. Enabled by shifting of transition temperature during hybrid cooling printing, printed sheets spontaneously turn into 3D structures after release from the platform, exhibiting bidirectional deformation with heating and cooling. By adjusting the nozzle and plate temperatures, NAT-LCEs with graded properties can be fabricated for intricate shape morphing. A wristband system with enhanced heart rate monitoring is also developed based on 3D-printed NAT-LCE. Our method may open new possibilities for soft robotics, biomedical devices, and wearable electronics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth Model for Magnetodynamics of Single Domain Nanoparticles: Implementation and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth (tSW) model and apply it in the context of Molecular Dynamics simulations. The model is validated against an ensemble of immobilized, randomly oriented uniaxial particles (solid superparamagnet) and a classical dilute ferrofluid for different combinations of anisotropy strength and magnetic field/moment coupling, at a fixed temperature. We compare analytical and simulation results to quantify the viability of the tSW model in reproducing the equilibrium (with and without dipole-dipole interactions) and dynamic (without dipole-dipole interactions) properties of magnetic soft matter systems. We show that if the anisotropy of a particle is more than five times higher than the thermal fluctuations, tSW is applicable and efficient. This approach allows one to consider the interplay between N\'eel and Brownian relaxation, often neglected in the fixed point-dipole representation-based magnetic soft matter theoretical investigations.</description>
