      <title>Backcasting biodiversity at high spatiotemporal resolution using flexible site-occupancy models for opportunistically sampled citizen science data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many taxonomic groups, online biodiversity portals used by naturalists and citizen scientists constitute the primary source of distributional information. Over the last decade, site-occupancy models have been advanced as a promising framework to analyse such loosely structured, opportunistically collected datasets. Current approaches often ignore important aspects of the detection process and do not fully capitalise on the information present in these datasets, leaving opportunities for fine-grained spatiotemporal backcasting untouched. We propose a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal site-occupancy model that aims to mimic the data-generating process that underlies common citizen science datasets sourced from public biodiversity portals, and yields rich biological output. We illustrate the use of the model to a dataset containing over 3M butterfly records in Belgium, collected through the citizen science data portal Observations.be. We show that the proposed approach enables retrospective predictions on the occupancy of species through time and space at high resolution, as well as inference on inter-annual distributional trends, range dynamics, habitat preferences, phenological patterns, detection patterns and observer heterogeneity. The proposed model can be used to increase the value of opportunistically collected data by naturalists and citizen scientists, and can aid the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of species for which rigorously collected data are absent or too costly to collect.</description>

      <title>Genuine and spurious bistability in a simple epidemic model with waning immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an infection-age structured epidemic model in which both the infectivity and the rate of loss of immunity depend on the time-since-infection. The model can be equivalently viewed as a nonlinear renewal equation for the incidence of infection or as a partial differential equation for the density of infected individuals. We explicitly consider gamma, rather than Erlang, distributed durations of infection using a combination of ODE approximations and numerical bifurcation methods. We show that the shape of this distribution strongly influences stability of the endemic equilibrium, even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the mean duration of infectiousness are fixed. Moreover, we establish the existence of regions of bistability, where a stable endemic equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic orbit. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of bistability in infection-age structured models with waning immunity alone. Finally, we show how common compartmental modelling approaches, which impose implicit assumptions on the distribution of the duration of infection, can lead to spurious dynamical outcomes. Taken together, our analysis underscores the crucial role of distributional structure in epidemic modelling and provides new insights into the rich dynamics of infection-age structured SIS/SIRS models.</description>

      <title>Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.</description>
