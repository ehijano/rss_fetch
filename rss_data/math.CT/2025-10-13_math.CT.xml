      <title>Instances of models of double-categorical theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We contribute a chapter in common to categorical database theory and to the study of higher morphisms between double categories. The common thread here is the notion of instance, or right module, which we generalize from functors from a plain category into Set to the models of a (cartesian) double theory. This provides a concept of instance for such objects as a category equipped with a monad, or a (symmetric) multicategory, recovering the multifunctors into Set in the latter case. We also show that instances of models are equivalent to an appropriate concept of discrete opfibration over that model, not recoverable as the representable discrete opfibrations in the 2-category of models. Finally, we give comprehensive factorization systems with these discrete opfibrations as the right class.</description>

      <title>Measure theory via Locales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to measure theory using the theory of locales. This includes concrete constructions of measure algebras associated to Radon measures, such as the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, via Grothendieck topologies constructed from valuations, that circumvent the classical approach via $\sigma$-algebras. As an application we obtain a functorial construction of the induced measure $\mu_*$ on the locale of sublocales $\mathfrak{Sl}(X)$ of a Hausdorff space $X$ equipped with a Radon measure $\mu$, which in particular shows that $\mu_*$ is invariant under measure-preserving homeomorphisms. We furthermore give a construction of the measurable locale associated to a smooth manifold, functorial in submersions, as well as comparison results to classical measure theory.</description>

      <title>Arrow algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14096v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures which induce elementary toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction. This includes localic toposes as well as various realizability toposes, in particular, those realizability toposes which are obtained from partial combinatory algebras. Since there are many examples of arrow algebras and arrow algebras have a number of closure properties, including a notion of subalgebra given by a nucleus, arrow algebras provide a flexible tool for constructing toposes; we illustrate this by providing some general tools for creating toposes for Kreisel's modified realizability.</description>

      <title>Fibrational approach to Grandis exactness for 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an abelian category, the (bi)fibration of subobjects is isomorphic to the (bi)fibration of quotients. This property captures substantial information about the exactness structure of a category. Indeed, as it was shown by the second author and T.~Weighill, categories equipped with a proper factorization system such that the opfibration of subobjects relative to the factorization system is isomorphic to the fibration of relative quotients are precisely the Grandis exact categories. In this paper we characterize those (1,1)-proper factorization systems on a 2-category in the sense of M.~Dupont and E.~Vitale, for which the weak 2-opfibration of relative 2-subobjects is biequivalent to the weak 2-fibration of relative 2-quotients. This results in a new notion of 2-dimensional exactness, which we then compare with similar notions in the context of categories enriched in pointed groupoids arising in the work of M.~Dupont and H.~Nakaoka.</description>
