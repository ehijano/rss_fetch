      <title>JanusDDG: A Thermodynamics-Compliant Model for Sequence-Based Protein Stability via Two-Fronts Multi-Head Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how residue variations affect protein stability is crucial for designing functional proteins and deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying disease-related mutations. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.</description>

      <title>Accurate stochastic simulation of nonlinear reactions between closest particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of diffusing point particles in which any triplet of particles reacts and is removed from the system when the relative proximity of the constituent particles satisfies a predefined condition. Proximity-based reaction conditions of this kind are commonly used in particle-based simulations of chemical kinetics to mimic bimolecular reactions, those involving just two reactants, and have been extensively studied. The rate at which particles react within the system is determined by the reaction condition and particulate diffusion. In the bimolecular case, analytic relations exist between the reaction rate and the distance at which particles react allowing modellers to tune the rate of the reaction within their simulations by simply altering the reaction condition. However, generalising proximity-based reaction conditions to trimolecular reactions, those involving three particles, is more complicated because it requires understanding the distribution of the closest diffusing particle to a point in the vicinity of a spatially dependent absorbing boundary condition. We find that in this case the evolution of the system is described by a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation with no known analytic solution, which makes it difficult to relate the reaction rate to the reaction condition. To resolve this, we use singular perturbation theory to obtain a leading-order solution and show how to derive an approximate expression for the reaction rate. We then use finite element methods to quantify the higher-order corrections to this solution and the reaction rate, which are difficult to obtain analytically. Leveraging the insights gathered from this analysis, we demonstrate how to correct for the errors that arise from adopting the approximate expression for the reaction rate, enabling for the construction of more accurate particle-based simulations than previously possible.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Framework for Determining Conformational Ensembles of Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered proteins play essential roles in myriad cellular processes, yet their structural characterization remains a major challenge due to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature. We here present a community-driven initiative to address this problem by advocating a unified framework for determining conformational ensembles of disordered proteins. Our aim is to integrate state-of-the-art experimental techniques with advanced computational methods, including knowledge-based sampling, enhanced molecular dynamics, and machine learning models. The modular framework comprises three interconnected components: experimental data acquisition, computational ensemble generation, and validation. The systematic development of this framework will ensure the accurate and reproducible determination of conformational ensembles of disordered proteins. We highlight the open challenges necessary to achieve this goal, including force field accuracy, efficient sampling, and environmental dependency, advocating for collaborative benchmarking and standardized protocols.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Under Feedback Covariate Shift for Biomolecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03613v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many applications of machine learning methods involve an iterative protocol in which data are collected, a model is trained, and then outputs of that model are used to choose what data to consider next. For example, one data-driven approach for designing proteins is to train a regression model to predict the fitness of protein sequences, then use it to propose new sequences believed to exhibit greater fitness than observed in the training data. Since validating designed sequences in the wet lab is typically costly, it is important to quantify the uncertainty in the model's predictions. This is challenging because of a characteristic type of distribution shift between the training and test data in the design setting -- one in which the training and test data are statistically dependent, as the latter is chosen based on the former. Consequently, the model's error on the test data -- that is, the designed sequences -- has an unknown and possibly complex relationship with its error on the training data. We introduce a method to quantify predictive uncertainty in such settings. We do so by constructing confidence sets for predictions that account for the dependence between the training and test data. The confidence sets we construct have finite-sample guarantees that hold for any prediction algorithm, even when a trained model chooses the test-time input distribution. As a motivating use case, we demonstrate with several real data sets how our method quantifies uncertainty for the predicted fitness of designed proteins, and can therefore be used to select design algorithms that achieve acceptable trade-offs between high predicted fitness and low predictive uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Virtual Lung Screening Trial (VLST): An In Silico Study Inspired by the National Lung Screening Trial for Lung Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11221</link>

Abstract: Clinical imaging trials play a crucial role in advancing medical innovation but are often costly, inefficient, and ethically constrained. Virtual Imaging Trials (VITs) present a solution by simulating clinical trial components in a controlled, risk-free environment. The Virtual Lung Screening Trial (VLST), an in silico study inspired by the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), illustrates the potential of VITs to expedite clinical trials, minimize risks to participants, and promote optimal use of imaging technologies in healthcare. This study aimed to show that a virtual imaging trial platform could investigate some key elements of a major clinical trial, specifically the NLST, which compared Computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR) for lung cancer screening. With simulated cancerous lung nodules, a virtual patient cohort of 294 subjects was created using XCAT human models. Each virtual patient underwent both CT and CXR imaging, with deep learning models, the AI CT-Reader and AI CXR-Reader, acting as virtual readers to perform recall patients with suspicion of lung cancer. The primary outcome was the difference in diagnostic performance between CT and CXR, measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The AI CT-Reader showed superior diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95) compared to the AI CXR-Reader's AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67-0.77). Furthermore, at the same 94% CT sensitivity reported by the NLST, the VLST specificity of 73% was similar to the NLST specificity of 73.4%. This CT performance highlights the potential of VITs to replicate certain aspects of clinical trials effectively, paving the way toward a safe and efficient method for advancing imaging-based diagnostics.</description>

      <title>BioX-CPath: Biologically-driven Explainable Diagnostics for Multistain IHC Computational Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of biologically interpretable and explainable models remains a key challenge in computational pathology, particularly for multistain immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. We present BioX-CPath, an explainable graph neural network architecture for whole slide image (WSI) classification that leverages both spatial and semantic features across multiple stains. At its core, BioX-CPath introduces a novel Stain-Aware Attention Pooling (SAAP) module that generates biologically meaningful, stain-aware patient embeddings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Disease multistain datasets. Beyond performance metrics, BioX-CPath provides interpretable insights through stain attention scores, entropy measures, and stain interaction scores, that permit measuring model alignment with known pathological mechanisms. This biological grounding, combined with strong classification performance, makes BioX-CPath particularly suitable for clinical applications where interpretability is key.
