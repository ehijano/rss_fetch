      <title>Lattice perspectives on doubly heavy tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly heavy tetraquarks have emerged as new probes to study the heavy hadron spectrum. With the experimental observation of the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{cc}^+$, they pose a unique opportunity to bring together efforts in experiment, phenomenology, and lattice QCD. In lattice calculations they are accessible as ground states, unlike hidden flavor tetraquarks, and this enables accurate determinations of the scattering parameters alongside the binding energies of these tetraquarks. Today, lattice calculations firmly predict $J^P=1^+$ $T_{bb}^{ud}$ and $T_{bb}^{us}$ as QCD bound states, while recent studies approaching the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{cc}^{ud}$ find it to be a virtual bound state at slightly non-physical input quark masses. Studies of the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{bc}^{ud}$ are ongoing and a new focus area. In light of these developments the evolution of this field until this point is reviewed. Emphasis is put on the methods in lattice spectroscopy that enable a robust evaluation of the lattice studies gathered. They are further reviewed towards their limitations and achievements. Current challenges and opportunities are discussed, including possibilities to approach the left-hand cut in the scattering analysis of the charm candidates and towards understanding the structure of those including two bottom quarks.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor in the 2d $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term goal of this project is the non-perturbative renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor in the 2d $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model using different methods which have been developed for QCD applications. As a first step, we have identified all operators that mix with the energy-momentum tensor once a lattice discretization is employed, that is all which are compatible with power counting and with the symmetries of the theory. Since these operators are constrained by non-linear Ward identities arising from the non-linear realization of the $O(3)$ symmetry, this is not entirely straightforward on the technical level. We have also outlined the basics of ongoing numerical simulations with shifted boundary conditions and an optimized constraint action to minimize lattice artifacts.</description>

      <title>Flavor mixing in charmonium and light mesons with optimal distillation profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the light meson - charmonium - glueball mixing using flavor-singlet meson operators built from optimal distillation profiles together with purely gluonic operators in different $J^{PC}$ channels at two different pion masses ($\approx$ $420$, $800$ MeV) in two $N_{\rm f} = 3 + 1$ ensembles at close to physical charm quark mass. We observe non-zero mixing correlations between the different types of operators and quantify the overlaps between states created by them and the energy eigenstates by means of a GEVP formulation. We are particularly interested in the scalar glueball and its possible decay into two pions so we also include two-pion operators in our calculation.</description>

      <title>Pion condensation at non-zero isospin chemical potential with Wilson fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to the case of non-zero baryon chemical potential, the isospin chemical potential does not introduce a sign problem and can be simulated on the lattice. When the isospin chemical potential is large enough, a phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate of pions takes place. Currently available results in the literature on the phase diagram and the equation of state in this setup employ staggered fermions. We present preliminary results on the onset of the pion condensation phase in simulations with Wilson fermions.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering Processes with Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the properties of $X(3872)$ and of its isovector partner $W_{c1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a simultaneous fit to BESIII data on $e^+e^-\to \gamma (D^0\bar{D}^{*0}\pi^0/J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ and LHCb data on $B^+\to K^+(J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ to precisely determine the properties of the $X(3872)$, with full consideration of three-body effects from $D^*\to D\pi$ decay, respecting both analyticity and unitarity. The $X(3872)$ is determined to be a bound state with a significance of $6\sigma$, and its pole is located at $E_X{=}\left(-53^{+~9}_{-24}-\,i\,34^{+~2}_{-12}\right) \rm keV$, relative to the nominal $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ threshold. Moreover, we confirm the presence of an isovector partner state, $W_{c1}$. It is found as a virtual state at $(1.6^{+0.7}_{-0.9}+ i\, 1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.6})\ \rm MeV$ relative to the $D^+ D^{*-}$ threshold on an unphysical Riemann sheet, strongly supporting a molecular nature of both $X(3872)$ and $W_{c1}$. As a highly non-trivial prediction we show that the $W_{c1}$ leads to nontrivial lineshapes in $B^0\to K^0X(3872)\to K^0 D^0\bar D^0\pi^0$ and $K^0J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ -- thus the scheme presented here can be tested further by improved measurements.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective model of cold and dense two-color QCD: The linear sigma model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review is devoted to summarizing recent developments of the linear sigma model (LSM) in cold and dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), in which lattice simulations are straightforwardly applicable thanks to the disappearance of the sign problem. In QC$_2$D, both theoretical and numerical studies derive the presence of the so-called baryon superfluid phase at sufficiently large chemical potential ($\mu_q$), where diquark condensates govern the ground state. The hadron mass spectrum simulated in this phase shows that the mass of an iso-singlet ($I=0$) and $0^-$ state is remarkably reduced, but such a mode cannot be described by the chiral perturbation theory. Motivated by this fact, I invent the LSM constructed upon the linear representation of chiral symmetry, or more precisely the Pauli-G\"ursey symmetry. Then, it is shown that my LSM successfully reproduces the low-lying hadron mass spectrum in a broad range of $\mu_q$ simulated on the lattice. As applications of the LSM, topological susceptibility and sound velocity in cold and dense QC$_2$D are evaluated to compare with lattice results. Besides, generalized Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation and hardon mass spectrum in the presence of a diquark source are analyzed. I also introduce an extended version of the LSM incorporating spin-$1$ hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I will give a brief overview of the Standard Model theory inputs needed for the precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{us}$ from semileptonic kaon decays, focusing on the long-distance electromagnetic corrections. I will then describe our recent effort to pin down this correction at sub-permille level, which further sharpens the so-called ``Cabibbo angle anomaly'', an interesting observation which may point towards new physics.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger Model with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe universal properties of bound states and allow us to calculate scattering amplitudes in processes with large momentum transfer. Calculating PDFs involves the evaluation of matrix elements with a Wilson line in a light-cone direction. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods in Euclidean spacetime, these matrix elements can be directly calculated in Minkowski-space using the Hamiltonian formalism. The necessary spatial- and time-evolution can be efficiently applied using established tensor network methods. We present PDFs in the Schwinger model calculated with matrix product states.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the chiral crossover transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD with M\"{o}bius domain-wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry in QCD with two light flavors is known to be restored through a crossover transition at a pseudo-critical temperature. However, the temperature dependence of the singlet part of the chiral symmetry and whether it is effectively restored at the same temperature is not well understood. Using (2+1)-flavor QCD configurations generated using the M\"{o}bius domain-wall discretization on an $N_\tau=8$ lattice, we construct suitable observables where the singlet and non-singlet chiral symmetries are disentangled in order to study their temperature dependence across the crossover transition. From the peak of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, we obtain a pseudo-critical temperature $T_{pc}=158.7{}_{{}-2.3}^{{}+2.6}$ MeV where the non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry is effectively restored. From a calculation of the topological susceptibility and its temperature dependence we find that the singlet $U_A(1)$ part of the chiral symmetry is not effectively restored at $T&lt;186$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Probing Celestial Energy and Charge Correlations through Real-Time Quantum Simulations: Insights from the Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</description>
