      <title>Transformers Beyond Order: A Chaos-Markov-Gaussian Framework for Short-Term Sentiment Forecasting of Any Financial OHLC timeseries Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-term sentiment forecasting in financial markets (e.g., stocks, indices) is challenging due to volatility, non-linearity, and noise in OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data. This paper introduces a novel CMG (Chaos-Markov-Gaussian) framework that integrates chaos theory, Markov property, and Gaussian processes to improve prediction accuracy. Chaos theory captures nonlinear dynamics; the Markov chain models regime shifts; Gaussian processes add probabilistic reasoning. We enhance the framework with transformer-based deep learning models to capture temporal patterns efficiently. The CMG Framework is designed for fast, resource-efficient, and accurate forecasting of any financial instrument's OHLC time series. Unlike traditional models that require heavy infrastructure and instrument-specific tuning, CMG reduces overhead and generalizes well. We evaluate the framework on market indices, forecasting sentiment for the next trading day's first quarter. A comparative study against statistical, ML, and DL baselines trained on the same dataset with no feature engineering shows CMG consistently outperforms in accuracy and efficiency, making it valuable for analysts and financial institutions.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stock Market Crash with Bayesian Generalised Pareto Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a Bayesian Generalised Pareto Regression (GPR) model to forecast extreme losses in Indian equity markets, with a focus on the Nifty 50 index. Extreme negative returns, though rare, can cause significant financial disruption, and accurate modelling of such events is essential for effective risk management. Traditional Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD) models often ignore market conditions; in contrast, our framework links the scale parameter to covariates using a log-linear function, allowing tail risk to respond dynamically to market volatility. We examine four prior choices for Bayesian regularisation of regression coefficients: Cauchy, Lasso (Laplace), Ridge (Gaussian), and Zellner's g-prior. Simulation results suggest that the Cauchy prior delivers the best trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity, achieving the lowest RMSE, AIC, and BIC values. Empirically, we apply the model to large negative returns (exceeding 5%) in the Nifty 50 index. Volatility measures from the Nifty 50, S&amp;P 500, and gold are used as covariates to capture both domestic and global risk drivers. Our findings show that tail risk increases significantly with higher market volatility. In particular, both S&amp;P 500 and gold volatilities contribute meaningfully to crash prediction, highlighting global spillover and flight-to-safety effects. The proposed GPR model offers a robust and interpretable approach for tail risk forecasting in emerging markets. It improves upon traditional EVT-based models by incorporating real-time financial indicators, making it useful for practitioners, policymakers, and financial regulators concerned with systemic risk and stress testing.</description>

      <title>Stylized Facts of High-Frequency Bitcoin Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses the high-frequency intraday Bitcoin dataset from 2019 to 2022. During this time frame, the Bitcoin market index exhibited two distinct periods, 2019-20 and 2021-22, characterized by an abrupt change in volatility. The Bitcoin price returns for both periods can be described by an anomalous diffusion process, transitioning from subdiffusion for short intervals to weak superdiffusion over longer time intervals. The characteristic features related to this anomalous behavior studied in the present paper include heavy tails, which can be described using a $q$-Gaussian distribution and correlations. When we sample the autocorrelation of absolute returns, we observe a power-law relationship, indicating time dependence in both periods initially. The ensemble autocorrelation of the returns decays rapidly. We fitted the autocorrelation with a power law to capture the decay and found that the second period experienced a slightly higher decay rate. The further study involves the analysis of endogenous effects within the Bitcoin time series, which are examined through detrending analysis. We found that both periods are multifractal and present self-similarity in the detrended probability density function (PDF). The Hurst exponent over short time intervals shifts from less than 0.5 ($\sim$ 0.42) in Period 1 to closer to 0.5 in Period 2 ($\sim$ 0.49), indicating that the market has gained efficiency over time.</description>
