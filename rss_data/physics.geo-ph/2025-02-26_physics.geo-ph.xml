      <title>Synergizing Deep Learning and Full-Waveform Inversion: Bridging Data-Driven and Theory-Guided Approaches for Enhanced Seismic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the integration of deep learning (DL) with full-waveform inversion (FWI) for enhanced seismic imaging and subsurface characterization. It covers FWI and DL fundamentals, geophysical applications (velocity estimation, deconvolution, tomography), and challenges (model complexity, data quality). The review also outlines future research directions, including hybrid, generative, and physics-informed models for improved accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in subsurface property estimation. The synergy between DL and FWI has the potential to transform geophysics, providing new insights into Earth's subsurface.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Pseudo-spectral Full Waveform Inversion via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FWI seeks to achieve a high-resolution model of the subsurface through the application of multi-variate optimization to the seismic inverse problem. Although now a mature technology, FWI has limitations related to the choice of the appropriate solver for the forward problem in challenging environments requiring complex assumptions, and very wide angle and multi-azimuth data necessary for full reconstruction are often not available.
  Deep Learning techniques have emerged as excellent optimization frameworks. These exist between data and theory-guided methods. Data-driven methods do not impose a wave propagation model and are not exposed to modelling errors. On the contrary, deterministic models are governed by the laws of physics.
  Application of seismic FWI has recently started to be investigated within Deep Learning. This has focussed on the time-domain approach, while the pseudo-spectral domain has not been yet explored. However, classical FWI experienced major breakthroughs when pseudo-spectral approaches were employed. This work addresses the lacuna that exists in incorporating the pseudo-spectral approach within Deep Learning. This has been done by re-formulating the pseudo-spectral FWI problem as a Deep Learning algorithm for a data-driven pseudo-spectral approach. A novel DNN framework is proposed. This is formulated theoretically, qualitatively assessed on synthetic data, applied to a two-dimensional Marmousi dataset and evaluated against deterministic and time-based approaches.
  Inversion of data-driven pseudo-spectral DNN was found to outperform classical FWI for deeper and over-thrust areas. This is due to the global approximator nature of the technique and hence not bound by forward-modelling physical constraints from ray-tracing.</description>

  Pseudo-spectral theory-guided FWI using RNN was shown to be more accurate than classical FWI with only 0.05 error tolerance and 1.45\% relative percent-age error. Indeed, this provides more stable convergence, able to identify faults better and has more low frequency content than classical FWI. Moreover, RNN was more suited than classical FWI at edge detection in the shallow and deep sections due to cleaner receiver residuals.</description>

      <title>Wind-driven collisions between floes explain the observed dispersion of Arctic sea ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of sea ice over the polar oceans plays an important role in climate. This transport is driven predominantly by turbulent winds, leading to stochastic motion of ice floes. Observed diffusivities and velocity distributions of sea ice deviate by orders of magnitude from Brownian models, making it challenging to predict ice transport. We fully resolve these gaps through stochastic granular simulations that account for interactions between ice floes as they respond to a noisy wind. Using only directly measured quantities as model inputs, we reproduce the dispersion, diffusivity, velocity distribution, and power spectra of sea ice observed in the Fram Strait with remarkable quantitative accuracy. We understand these features as direct consequences of collisions between floes, which rapidly dissipate the energy injected by wind. A kinetic theory provides insights into these dynamics in terms of environmental properties, and makes predictions in close agreement with observations. The ideas and tools developed here pave the way for a new predictive understanding of global sea ice transport in terms of local floe-scale processes.</description>

      <title>Estimating Magnitude Completeness in Earthquake Catalogs: A Comparative Study of Catalog-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Without rigorous attention to the completeness of earthquake catalogs, claims of new discoveries or forecasting skills cannot be deemed credible. Therefore, estimating the completeness magnitude (Mc) is a critical step. Among various approaches, catalog-based methods are the simplest, most straightforward, and most commonly used. However, current evaluation frameworks for these methods lack a unified simulation strategy for generating catalogs that are independent of specific Mc estimation methods. An effective strategy should also be capable of simulating datasets with non-uniform Mc distributions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this study, we assess nine catalog-based methods under a robust evaluation framework specifically tailored for this purpose. These methods are tested on datasets with homogeneous and heterogeneous Mc distributions, as well as on real-world earthquake catalogs. The method of b-value stability by Woessner and Wiemer (2005), referred to as MBS-WW in this study, demonstrates the best overall performance. The prior model generated by MBS-WW is used as the foundation for generating an updated Mc map for China with the Bayesian Magnitude of Completeness (BMC) method. We also introduce, BSReLU, an augmented Gutenberg-Richter model with a novel probabilistic framework for modeling. The BSReLU model replaces deterministic estimates of Mc with a probabilistic framework that models the smooth transition in detection likelihood from zero to one as earthquake magnitudes increase. By evaluating the limitations of these foundational catalog-based methods, this study seeks to refine our understanding of their appropriate applications, offering a clearer, unbiased perspective on seismicity through improved observational data quality.</description>

      <title>Two-phase immiscible displacement of water by gas accounting for fines migration: analytical model for vertical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fines migration during subterranean CO2 storage is considered as one of major contributors to formation damage and injectivity decline. The main formation damage mechanism by migrating fines is rock clogging by straining of particles in thin pore throats. The main mobilisation mechanism of attached natural reservoir fines is their detachment by capillary forces exerting from the advancing water-gas menisci. The mathematical model for displacement of water by injected CO2 from layer-cake reservoirs under fines mobilisation, migration and straining extends the classical vertical capillary-gravity equilibrium model, where hydrostatic pressure gradient is assumed in each phase. The analytical model generalises classical Buckley-Leverett problem, where the extended fractional flow accounts for permeability damage due to fines migration. We show the significant effect of fines migration on water displacement - while it decreases well injectivity, fines migration simultaneously increases reservoir sweep, increasing CO2 storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Distributed acoustic sensing for ocean applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields, including biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an evolving technique for continuous, wide-coverage measurements of mechanical vibrations, which is suited to ocean applications. DAS illuminates an optical fiber with laser pulses and measures the backscattered wave due to small random variations in the refractive index of the material. Specifically, DAS uses coherent optical interferometry to measure the phase difference of the backscattered wave from adjacent locations along the fiber. External stimuli, such as mechanical strain due to acoustic wavefields impinging on the fiber-optic cable, modulate the backscattered wave. Hence, the differential phase measurements of the optical backscatter are proportional to the underlying physical quantities of the surrounding wavefield. Continuous measurement of the backscattered electromagnetic signal provides a distributed sensing modality that extends spatially along the fiber. We provide an overview of DAS technology and detail the underlying physics, from electromagnetic to mechanical and eventually acoustic quantities. We explain the effect of DAS acquisition parameters in signal processing and show the potential of DAS for sound source detection on data collected from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array https://doi.org/10.58046/5J60-FJ89.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of hydraulic fracture propagation in media with heterogeneous toughness: the energy balance, elastic battery and fluid backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates hydraulic fracture in a media with periodic heterogeneous toughness. Results for the plane-strain (KGD) model are analysed. The energy distribution as the fracture propagates is examined, along with the evolution of the crack geometry. It is shown that the solid layer acts as an elastic battery, discharging to promote rapid propagation through weaker material layers. The limiting case of an infinite-length crack is discussed. The velocity of the fluid throughout the crack length is also considered. For fractures in high-toughness material it is shown that fluid backflow can occur, with its profile dependent on the toughness distribution. The implications of these findings are discussed.</description>
