      <title>Measuring multi-site pulse transit time with an AI-enabled mmWave radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is a measure of arterial stiffness and a physiological marker associated with cardiovascular function, with an inverse relationship to diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We present the first AI-enabled mmWave system for contactless multi-site PTT measurement using a single radar. By leveraging radar beamforming and deep learning algorithms our system simultaneously measures PTT and estimates diastolic blood pressure at multiple sites. The system was evaluated across three physiological pathways - heart-to-radial artery, heart-to-carotid artery, and mastoid area-to-radial artery -- achieving correlation coefficients of 0.73-0.89 compared to contact-based reference sensors for measuring PTT. Furthermore, the system demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.90-0.92 for estimating DBP, and achieved a mean error of -1.00-0.62 mmHg and standard deviation of 4.97-5.70 mmHg, meeting the FDA's AAMI guidelines for non-invasive blood pressure monitors. These results suggest that our proposed system has the potential to provide a non-invasive measure of cardiovascular health across multiple regions of the body.</description>

      <title>AgentChangeBench: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Goal-Shift Robustness in Conversational AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions, yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness, Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency. AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$ recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above $80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.</description>

      <title>Dendritic Computing with Multi-Gate Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although inspired by neuronal systems in the brain, artificial neural networks generally employ point-neurons, which offer far less computational complexity than their biological counterparts. Neurons have dendritic arbors that connect to different sets of synapses and offer local non-linear accumulation - playing a pivotal role in processing and learning. Inspired by this, we propose a novel neuron design based on a multi-gate ferroelectric field-effect transistor that mimics dendrites. It leverages ferroelectric nonlinearity for local computations within dendritic branches, while utilizing the transistor action to generate the final neuronal output. The branched architecture paves the way for utilizing smaller crossbar arrays in hardware integration, leading to greater efficiency. Using an experimentally calibrated device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks incorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison to much larger networks without dendrites ($\sim$17$\times$ fewer trainable weight parameters). These findings suggest that dendritic hardware can significantly improve computational efficiency, and learning capacity of neuromorphic systems optimized for edge applications.</description>

      <title>Neural 3D Object Reconstruction with Small-Scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100 grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger platforms.</description>
