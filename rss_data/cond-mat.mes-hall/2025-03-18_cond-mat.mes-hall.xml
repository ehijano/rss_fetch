      <title>Spin and Charge Transport Mediated by Fractionalized Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport in systems composed of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments of a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. For example, $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$ either intrinsically doped or in proximity to graphene. Our analysis reveals distinct temperature-dependent transport behaviors due to the QSL gap and the Majorana excitation spectrum, which are greatly enhanced when the velocities of itinerant-electrons and QSL excitations become comparable. These transport characteristics could potentially be employed to reveal the fractionalized excitations of the spin liquid.</description>

      <title>A scalable, reproducible platform for molecular electronic technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular electronics and other technologies whose components comprise individual molecules have been pursued for half a century because the molecular scale represents the limit of miniaturisation of objects whose structure is tuneable for function. Despite the promise, practical progress has been hindered by the lack of methodologies for directed assembly of arbitrary structures applicable at the molecular scale.DNA nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale.
  Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of success and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and adaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular components, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of classical and quantum molecular technologies.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Plasmon Interaction in Nanoparticle Assemblies: Role of the Dipole-Quadrupole Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of metallic nanoparticle assemblies is nowadays well-controlled, such that these systems offer the possibility of controlling light at a sub-wavelength scale, thanks, for instance, to surface plasmons. Determining the energy dispersion of plasmons likely to couple to light within these nanostructures is, therefore, a necessary preliminary task on the way to understanding both their photonic properties and their physical nature, namely the role of the quadrupole contribution. Starting with a general model that takes account of all energy modes, we show that its low-lying energy dispersion gained numerically, can be compared to that of a minimal model that treats dipoles and quadrupoles on the same footing. The main advantage of the latter relies on the fact that its formulation is tractable, such that a semi-analytical Bogoliubov transformation allows one to access the experimentally relevant energy bands. Based on this semi-analytical derivation, we determine quantitatively the limit of validity of the dipole-only model, the presently proposed dipole and quadrupole model, compared to a full-plasmon-mode Hamiltonian. The results show that the dispersion relation, which includes dipoles and quadrupoles, is sufficient to capture the low-energy physics at play in most experimental situations. Besides, we show that at small lattice spacing, the contribution of quadrupoles is dominant around the Brillouin zone center.</description>

      <title>Quantized Magneto-Terahertz Effects in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of Strain-Induced Pseudogauge Fields on Exciton Dispersion, Transport, and Interactions in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of strain on exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering as a powerful tool for controlling exciton transport and interactions in TMD-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Hot-carrier thermal breakdown and S-type current-voltage characteristics in perforated graphene structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the carrier transport characteristics of perforated graphene layer (PGL) composed of arrays of interdigital coplanar graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. We analyze their operation at room-temperature. Under an applied bias voltage, two-dimensional electron and hole systems (2DES and 2DHS) form in adjacent GMRs. The terminal current in these PGL structures is primarily governed by thermionic transport across the GNR bridges. As electrons and holes traverse the GNRs, they induce heating in the 2DES and 2DHS, creating a positive feedback loop between carrier heating and thermionic emission. This phenomenon, characterized as hot-carrier thermal breakdown, can give rise to S-shaped inter-GMR current-voltage characteristics. These unique transport properties make PGLs promising candidates for fast, voltage-controlled room-temperature switches and electromagnetic radiation detectors.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant Casimir-Polder repulsion with a monolayer topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable right-circularly polarized state of a two-level atomic system in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in the presence of a chiral molecular potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface and show, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.</description>

      <title>Visualizing isospin magnetic texture and intervalley exchange interaction in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer rhombohedral graphene offers a rich platform for strong electron interactions without a moire superlattice. The in situ tunable band structure and nontrivial topology lead to a variety of novel correlated electronic states with isospin order dictated by the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Hunds exchange interactions. However, versatile methods for mapping local isospin textures and determining the exchange energies are currently lacking. Utilizing a nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device in a vector magnetic field, we image the magnetization textures in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene. We reveal sharp magnetic phase transitions marking spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. In the quarter metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. The half metal phase is shown to have a very small magnetic anisotropy, providing the first experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy, which is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. By contrasting to magnetotransport measurements, we show that high-field electronic states are governed by unique topological magnetic band reconstruction. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies, paves the way to a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.</description>

      <title>In situ engineering hexagonal boron nitride in van der Waals heterostructures with selective SF6 etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures are at the forefront in materials heterostructure engineering, offering the ultimate control in layer selectivity and capability to combine virtually any material. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), the most commonly used dielectric material, has proven indispensable in this field, allowing the encapsulation of active 2D materials preserving their exceptional electronic quality. However, not all device applications require full encapsulation but rather require open surfaces, or even selective patterning of hBN layers. Here, we report on a procedure to engineer top hBN layers within van der Waals heterostructures while preserving the underlying active 2D layers. Using a soft selective SF6 etching combined with a series of pre and post-etching treatments, we demonstrate that pristine surfaces can be exposed with atomic flatness while preserving the active layers electronic quality. We benchmark our technique using graphene encapsulated with hBN Hall bar devices. Using Raman spectroscopy combined with quantum transport, we show high quality can be preserved in etched regions by demonstrating low temperature carrier mobilities of 200,000 cm2Vs-1, ballistic transport probed through magnetic focusing, and intrinsic room temperature phonon-limited mobilities. Atomic force microscopy brooming and O2 plasma cleaning are identified as key pre-etching steps to obtaining pristine open surfaces while preserving electronic quality. The technique provides a clean method for opening windows into mesoscopic van der Waals devices that can be used for local probe experiments, patterning top hBN in situ, and exposing 2D layers to their environment for sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.</description>

      <title>Upper critical magnetic field and multiband superconductivity in artificial high-Tc superlattices of nano quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial high-Tc superlattices (AHTS) composed of quantum building blocks with tunable superconducting critical temperature have been synthesized by engineering their nanoscale geometry using the Bianconi-Perali-Valletta (BPV) two gaps superconductivity theory. These quantum heterostructures consist of quantum wells made of superconducting, modulation-doped Mott insulators (S), confined by a metallic (N) potential barrier. The lattice geometry has been carefully engineered to induce the predicted Fano-Feshbach shape resonance between the gaps, near a topological Lifshitz transition. Here, we validate the BPV theory by providing compelling experimental evidence that AHTS samples, at the peak of the superconducting dome, exhibit resonant two-band, two-gap superconductivity. This is demonstrated by measuring the temperature dependence of the upper critical magnetic field,Bc2, in samples with superlattice periods 3.3&lt;d&lt;5.28 nm and L/d ratios close to the magic value 2/3 (where L is the thickness of the superconducting La2CuO4 layer and d is the superlattice period). The data reveal the predicted upward concavity in Hc2(T) and a characteristic kink in the coherence length as a function of temperature, confirming the predicted two-band superconductivity with Fermi velocity ratio 0.25 and significant pair exchange term among the two condensates.</description>

      <title>Surface-state engineering for nonlinear charge and spin photocurrent generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically explore a pathway for generating nonlinear charge and spin photocurrents using spin-orbit-split surface states. This mechanism enables net charge and spin flow along the surface plane even in centrosymmetric bulk environments like the Rashba prototype Au(111), where we establish the key principles by combining model predictions with density functional calculations. We further identify the Tl/Si(111) surface, characterized by strong non-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, as a prime candidate for experimental validation; with slight doping, it develops metallic spin-orbit-split states featuring remarkable relativistic properties while the bulk remains semiconducting. Our non-linear simulations reveal distinct angular signatures and magnitudes comparable to bulk ferroelectrics, highlighting the potential of surface-state photocurrents for low-bias optoelectronic applications. Moreover, the intricate spin polarization of surface states opens new possibilities as a nonlinear spin filter, providing a far more versatile platform than the spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Effects of time-periodic drive in the linear response for planar-Hall set-ups with Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic drive on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar-Hall/planar-thermal-Hall set-ups. The drive is modelled here by circularly-polarized electromagnetic fields, whose effects are incorporated by a combination of the Floquet theorem and the van Vleck perturbation theory, applicable in the high-frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal and in-plane transverse components of the linear-response coefficients using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport coefficients in certain limits of the system parameters, where it is possible to derive the explicit analytical expressions. Our results demonstrate that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals etch their trademark signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics is a new paradigm of electron transport in high-mobility devices, where frequent electron collisions give rise to a collective electron flow profile. However, conventional descriptions of these flows, which are based on the fluid equations for a classical gas extended to include impurity scattering, do not account for the distinct collisional relaxation in quantum-mechanical systems. In particular, by dint of Pauli blocking even modes of the distribution function relax over significantly shorter length scales than odd modes (dubbed the ``tomographic'' effect). We establish an analytical description of tomographic electron flow in a channel, and find four new distinguishing features: (i) Non-equilibrium effects from the boundaries penetrate significantly deeper into the flow domain; (ii) an additional velocity slip condition leads to a significant increase in the channel conductance; (iii) bulk rarefaction corrections decrease the curvature of the velocity profile in the channel center; and (iv) all these anomalous transport effects are rapidly suppressed with magnetic fields. The latter effect leads to a non-monotonic magneto-conductance, which can be used to measure both the even- and odd-mode mean free paths. Our asymptotic results unveil the underlying physics of tomographic flows and provide an alternative to numerical solutions of the Fermi-liquid equations.</description>

      <title>Tomographic electron flow in confined geometries: Beyond the dual-relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic-like electron flows are typically modeled using the Stokes-Ohm equation or a kinetic description that is based on a dual-relaxation time approximation. Such models assume a short intrinsic mean free path $\ell_e$ due to momentum-conserving electronic scattering and a large extrinsic mean free path $\ell_\text{MR}$ due to momentum-relaxing impurity scattering. This assumption, however, is overly simplistic and falls short at low temperatures, where it is known from exact diagonalization studies of the electronic collision integral that another large electronic mean free path $\ell_o$ emerges, which describes long-lived odd electron modes -- this is sometimes known as the tomographic effect. Here, using a matched asymptotic expansion of the Fermi liquid kinetic equation that includes different electron relaxation times, we derive a general asymptotic theory for tomographic flows in arbitrary smooth boundary geometries. Our key results are a set of governing equations for the electron density and electron current, their slip boundary conditions and boundary layer corrections near diffuse edges. We find that the tomographic effect strongly modifies previous hydrodynamic theories for electron flows: In particular, we find that (i) an equilibrium is established in the bulk, where the flow is governed by Stokes-Ohm like equations with significant finite-wavelength corrections, (ii) the velocity slip conditions for these equations are strongly modified from the widely-used hydrodynamic slip-length condition (iii) a large kinetic boundary layer arises near diffuse boundaries of width $\sim\sqrt{\ell_e \ell_o}$, and (iv) all these effects are strongly suppressed by an external magnetic field. We illustrate our findings for electron flow in a channel. The equations derived here represent the fundamental governing equations for tomographic electron flow in arbitrary smooth geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berry curvature characterizes one aspect of the geometry of quantum states. It materializes, among other consequences, as an anomalous velocity of wave packets. In non-Hermitian systems, wave packet dynamics is enriched by additional terms that can be expressed as generalizations of the Berry connection to non-orthogonal eigenstates. Here, we contextualize these anomalous non-Hermitian contributions by showing that they directly arise from the geometry of the underlying quantum states as corrections to the distance between left and perturbed right eigenstates. By calculating the electric susceptibility for a single-band wave packet and comparing it with the wave packet's localization, we demonstrate that these terms can, in some circumstances, lead to a violation of fluctuation-dissipation relations in non-Hermitian systems. We discuss experimental signatures in terms of response functions and transport signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of nominally bulk modes, not only drastically reshapes the spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems, but also dramatically modifies the real-time dynamics therein. Here we investigate the time evolution of waves (or quantum-mechanical particles) initialized around the edge of non-Hermitian lattices. The non-Hermitian skin effect tends to localize the wave to the edge, meaning that the real-time dynamics differs from the Bloch-theory picture. We focus on the long-time decay or growth rate of wave function, which is quantified by the Lyapunov exponents. These exponents can be obtained from the saddle points in the complex momentum space. We propose an efficient yet unambiguous criterion for identifying the dominant saddle point that determines the Lyapunov exponents. Our criterion can be precisely formulated in terms of a mathematical concept known as the Lefschetz thimble. Counterintuitively, the seemingly natural criterion based on the imaginary part of the energy fails. Our work provides a coherent theory for characterizing the real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices. Our predictions are testable in various non-Hermitian physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes, concentrating photovoltaic cells and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and how this changes with respect to both the time in the excited state of the exciton and its energy. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number only rises to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophoric units that facilitates highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. Our results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is naturally difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised that control exciton-exciton annihilation.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically exact few-body algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking advantage of time-dependent rotations of electronic orbitals, we introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopic bath, revealing that almost all rotated orbitals can be made inactive (in a trivial product state). Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimension saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow precisely the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the temporal and spatial domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <title>Carbonic anhydrase II simulated with a universal neural network potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carbonic anhydrase II enzyme (CA II) is one of the most significant enzymes in nature, reversibly converting CO$_2$ to bicarbonate at a remarkable rate. The precise mechanism it uses to achieve this rapid turnover remains unclear due to our inability to directly observe or simulate the full process dynamically. Here, we use a recently developed universal neural network potential (Orb) to simulate the active site of CA II. We reproduce several known features of the reaction mechanism, including the proton relay that conducts protons out of the active site to the His64 residue. Additionally, we observe a new reaction pathway where CO$_2$ reacts with a water molecule in the active site, which donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide. This differs from the established mechanism where CO$_2$ directly reacts with hydroxide. Existing experimental data and independent quantum chemistry calculations are used to support the plausibility of this new mechanism. This demonstrates the potential of Orb to efficiently generate novel insights into important molecular scale processes that can potentially be harnessed to improve CO$_2$ capture technologies and drug design.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cooperativity on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Light-induced Spin-State Switching of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ Spin-Crossover Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly flexible bistable molecular switches with two distinct spin states that can be switched into each other by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. In the condensed phase, this spin switching phenomenon is determined not only by the chemical and structural properties of the SCO compound but also by intermolecular interactions within the SCO material and their coupling to surfaces. These interactions lead to cooperative effects in the spin switching behavior that are, for instance, reflected in the thermal hysteresis of the spin switching or determine the speed of the thermal and optical spin transition within a thin film of SCO complexes.
  In this study, we shed new light on the cooperativity-driven spatial and temporal dynamics of the collective light-induced spin switching of thin SCO films on a gold single crystal. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transition between the low-spin and high-spin light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) states of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ compound. Using real-time photoemission electron microscopy with millisecond time resolution, we uncover spectroscopic signatures of the light-induced spin state switching to the LIESST state even $200\, \mu$m outside the spot of direct optical excitation. This observation is identical for both continuous wave and femtosecond laser light excitations in the visible spectral range. The timescale of the spin-switching dynamics is indicative of a photothermal process in which molecules far from the laser spot relax back to the low-spin ground state faster than those within the directly illuminated region. All of these observations highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions in the spin state switching of the SCO thin film.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is underpinned by their vibrational dynamics, yet surface phonons in layered materials remain poorly understood due to limitations in conventional experimental techniques. We employ helium-3 spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy to resolve the lowest energy (&lt;10 meV) dispersions of surface phonons on bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS\textsubscript{2}) with sub-meV energy resolution near $\Gamma$. We identify two low-energy optical modes, E_2g and A_1g, exhibiting unexpected quasi-acoustic dispersion, and crucially do not find evidence of an acoustic mode at the surface. A_1g follows a purely quadratic dispersion (\(\omega_{A_{1g}} \propto q^2\)), while \(E_{2g}\) displays quartic behaviour (\(\omega_{E_{2g}} \propto q^4\)), indicative of strong anharmonicity. These modes, absent in inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) measurements and theoretical predictions of the bulk, exhibit finite-layer confinement equivalent to 4.5 and 6 layers, respectively. Their rapid dispersion yields substantial group velocities at small wavevectors, suggesting a dominant role in surface and few-layer thermal transport. This work establishes optical surface phonons as key drivers of thermal management in 2D materials and highlights the necessity of understanding surface phononics for designing next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optics of a charge-tunable quantum dot: Observation of a negative diamagnetic shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present magneto-optical studies of a self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot in neutral and positively charged states. The diamagnetic shifts and Zeeman splitting of many well-identified optical transitions are precisely measured. Remarkably, a pronounced negative diamagnetic shift is observed for spectral lines resulting from a doubly positively charged excitonic complex. We use the Hartree - Fock approximation for describing the direct Coulomb and exchange interactions between the quantum dot confined carriers in various configurations. A simple harmonic potential model, which we extend to capture the influence of an externally applied magnetic field in Faraday configuration, is then used to quantitatively account for all the measured diamagnetic shifts. We show that the negative shift is due to the change in the hole-hole exchange interaction energy induced by the magnetic field. Using this model and the measured shifts we extract the dielectric constant of the quantum dot material and get a decent estimate of the quantum dot dimensions. Further, the measured Zeeman splitting of the various spectral lines are also explained by a simple model using algebraic sums and differences of the $g$-factors of the confined charge carriers in their respective first and second discrete energy levels. Finally, the obtained values of the electronic $g$-factor and that of the dielectric constant are independently used to determine the effective composition (x) of the ternary In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As quantum dot. Both agree to within the experimental uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the elastic properties, structural effects, and low-energy physics of a sheared nanoribbon placed on top of graphene, which creates a gradually changing moire pattern. By means of a classical elastic model we derive the strains in the ribbon and we obtain its electronic energy spectrum with a scaled tight-binding model. The size of the sheared region is determined by the balance between elastic and van der Waals energy, and different regimes are identified. Near the clamped edge, moderate strains and small twist angles lead to one-dimensional channels. Near the sheared edge, a long region behaves like magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), showing a sharp peak in the density of states, mostly isolated from the rest of the spectrum. We also calculate the band topology along the ribbon and we find that it is stable for large intervals of strains and twist angles. Together with the experimental observations, these results show that the sheared nanoribbon geometry is ideal for exploring superconductivity and correlated phases in TBG in the very sought-after regime of ultralow twist angle disorder.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time, recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity. We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS), we experimentally investigate the quantum geometry and quantum information in the large-gap insulator, LiF. Using sum rules for the density-density response function measured in IXS, we compute the quantum Fisher information of the equilibrium density matrix of LiF associated with density perturbations. Next, by exploiting universal relations between the quantum Fisher information, the optical conductivity, and the quantum metric tensor, we extrapolate the diagonal $(h,k,l) = (1,0,0)$ component of the quantum metric of LiF, known as the quantum weight. We compare our results to recently-proposed bounds on the quantum weight and find that the quantum weight in LiF comes close to saturating a theoretical upper bound, showing that quantum-mechanical delocalization plays an important role even in ionic insulators. Our work serves as a proof-of-principle that IXS techniques can be used to quantify state-of-the-art quantum geometric quantities of materials, and establishes the quantum Fisher information as an experimentally-accessible generalization of quantum geometry to real materials.</description>

      <title>Designing Flat Bands and Pseudo-Landau Levels in GaAs with Patterned Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial band topology. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial band topology and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.</description>

      <title>Efficiency and Mechanism of Heat Flux Rectification with Non-Reciprocal Surface Waves in Weyl-Semi-Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the mechanism of near-field heat transfer rectification between two Weyl semimetal nanoparticles and a planar Weyl semimetal substrate via the coupling to non-reciprocal surface modes. We first show that the previously predicted rectification ratio of 2673 is incorrect and should rather be 1502. Furthermore we show that depending on the distance between the nanoparticles there can be a much more efficient heat flux rectification with ratios of about 6000. Furthermore, we identify a previously overlooked range of forward rectification and a range of strong backward rectification with rectification ratios larger than 8000 for relatively small Weyl node separations. We investigate the mechanism behind this large heat flux rectification and study its sensitivity with respect to certain material parameters and temperature showing that even larger rectification ratios up to 15000 are possible highlighting that certain Weyl semimetals are strong candidates for highly efficient heat flux rectification.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12010v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. We theoretically prove the topological behavior and phase transition of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Also, Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha&lt;1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term $(C_s=1$ and $C_v=0)$, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha&gt;1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of non-trivial and trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Current Flow Mapping in Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls using Scanning NV-Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of parallel plate capacitors, with ferroelectric lithium niobate as the dielectric layer, can be extensively and progressively modified by the controlled injection of conducting domain walls. Domain wall-based memristor devices hence result. Microstructures, developed as a result of partial switching, are complex and so simple models of equivalent circuits, based on the collective action of all conducting domain wall channels acting identically and in parallel, may not be appropriate. Here, we directly map the current density in ferroelectric domain wall memristors in-situ, by mapping Oersted fields, using nitrogen vacancy centre microscopy. Current density maps were found to directly correlate with the domain microstructure, revealing that a strikingly small fraction of the total domain wall network is responsible for the majority of the current flow. This insight forces a two order of magnitude correction to the carrier densities, previously inferred from standard scanning probe or macroscopic electrical characterisation.</description>

      <title>Coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamics and viscous thermoelectric equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</description>

      <title>Spin pumping effect in non-Fermi liquid metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin pumping effect is a sensitive and well-established experimental method in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials. We propose that spin pumping effect can be a valuable probe for non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors at the 2D interface of magnetic heterostructures. We show that the modulations of ferromagnetic resonance exhibit power-law scalings in frequency and temperature for NFL metals induced near a quantum critical point (QCP). At the Ising nematic QCP, we demonstrate that the enhanced Gilbert damping coefficient $\delta \alpha$ acquires negative power-law exponents in distinct frequency regimes. The exponents convey universal parameters inherited from the QCP and reflect the non-quasiparticle nature of the spin carriers in the NFL metal. At finite temperature, we show that the Gilbert damping mechanism is restored in the quantum critical regime and $\delta \alpha$ measures the temperature dependence of the correlation length. Our theoretical proposal has the potential to stimulate the development of an interdisciplinary research domain where insights from non-equilibrium spin physics in spintronics are integrated into strongly correlated matter.</description>

      <title>On the role of geometric phase in the dynamics of elastic waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric phase provides important mathematical insights to understand the fundamental nature and evolution of the dynamic response in a wide spectrum of systems ranging from quantum to classical mechanics. While the concept of geometric phase, which is an additional phase factor occurring in dynamical systems, holds the same meaning across different fields of application, its use and interpretation can acquire important nuances specific to the system of interest. In recent years, the development of quantum topological materials and its extension to classical mechanical systems have renewed the interest in the concept of geometric phase. This review revisits the concept of geometric phase and discusses, by means of either established or original results, its critical role in the design and dynamic behavior of elastic waveguides. Concepts of differential geometry and topology are put forward to provide a theoretical understanding of the geometric phase and its connection to the physical properties of the system. Then, the concept of geometric phase is applied to different types of elastic waveguides to explain how either topologically trivial or non-trivial behavior can emerge based on the geometric features of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a photonic flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</description>

      <title>Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.</description>

      <title>Scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of over 100 NV centers in parallel. We show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 108 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 5,778 unique correlation coefficients. We discuss how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable parallelized high-throughput sensing experiments that retain the nanoscale spatial resolution of single defects, and will thereby help to unlock advances in applications such as single-molecule NMR and characterization of integrated circuits. In addition, our approach to multiplexing provides a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.</description>

      <title>Zero energy modes with Gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as Gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>
