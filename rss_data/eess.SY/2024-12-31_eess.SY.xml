      <title>Online Low-Carbon Workload, Energy, and Temperature Management of Distributed Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Towards influence centrality: where to not add an edge in the network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a strongly connected group of individuals involved in decision-making. The opinions of the individuals evolve using the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model. We consider that there are two competing `influencers' (stubborn agents) vying for control over the final opinion of the group. We investigate the impact of modifying the network interactions on their respective control over the final opinions (influence centrality). We use signal flow graphs (SFG) to relate the network interactions with the influence that each `influencer' exerts on others. We present the sufficient conditions on the edge modifications which lead to the increase of the influence of an `influencer' at the expense of the other. Interestingly, the analysis also reveals the existence of redundant edge modifications that result in no change in the influence centrality of the network. We present several numerical examples to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Model Predictive Control for Quadcopters with Formal Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel cascade control structure with formal guarantees of uniform almost global asymptotic stability for the state tracking error dynamics of a quadcopter. The proposed approach features a model predictive control strategy for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for the non-zero total thrust constraint. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude, angular velocity and acceleration references, subsequently tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. The proposed cascade control strategy is validated through numerical case studies, underlying high-fidelity models, demonstrating its ability to track fast trajectories with small error.</description>

      <title>Distributed Convex Optimization with State-Dependent (Social) Interactions over Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at distributed multi-agent convex optimization where the
  communications network among the agents are presented by a random
  sequence of possibly state-dependent weighted graphs. This is the first work to consider both random arbitrary communication networks and state-dependent interactions among agents. The state-dependent weighted random operator of the graph is shown to be quasi-nonexpansive;
  this property neglects a priori distribution assumption
  of random communication topologies to be imposed on the operator. Therefore, it contains more general class of
  random networks with or without asynchronous protocols. A more general mathematical optimization
  problem than that addressed in the literature is presented, namely minimization of a convex function over the fixed-value point set of a quasi-nonexpansive random operator.
  A discrete-time algorithm is provided that is able to converge both almost surely and in mean square to the global solution of the optimization problem. Hence, as a special case,
  it reduces to a totally asynchronous algorithm for the
  distributed optimization problem. The algorithm is able to converge even if the weighted matrix of the graph is periodic and irreducible under synchronous protocol. Finally, a case study on a network of robots in an automated warehouse is
  given where there is distribution dependency among random communication graphs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Supervisory Control Algorithm to Avoid Deadlock in a Manufacturing System Based on Petri Net in Presence of Resource Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that resource failure, including robots and machines, in a manufacturing system can result in deadlocks. This issue not only hampers the system's performance but can also inflict significant damage on the manufacturing process. In this paper, we present a new algorithm developed through modeling of a manufacturing system using Petri net that ensures the liveness of the net in the event of such a failure. To detect possible failures, we first design a recovery subnet that is integrated into the resource. Next, we analyze the effects of failures on each state of the network to identify forbidden states. Finally, we propose an algorithm that optimally adds control places and establishes new constant vectors within the network, enabling effective management of remaining resources across different parts of the net. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a system featuring three manufacturing lines, demonstrating its error-free operation while ensuring key properties such as boundedness, liveness, and performance continuity within the net.</description>

      <title>Low-Thrust Under-Actuated Satellite Formation Guidance and Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents autonomous guidance and control strategies for the purpose of reconfiguring close-range multi-satellite formations. The formation under consideration includes $N$ under-actuated deputy satellites and an uncontrolled virtual or physical chief spacecraft. The guidance problem is formulated as a trajectory optimization problem that incorporates typical dynamical and physical constraints, alongside a minimum acceleration threshold. This latter constraint arises from the physical limitations of the adopted low-thrust technology, which is commonly employed for precise, close-range relative orbital maneuvers. The guidance and control problem is addressed in two frameworks: centralized and distributed. The centralized approach provides a fuel-optimal solution, but it is practical only for formations with a small number of deputies. The distributed approach is more scalable but yields sub-optimal solutions. In the centralized framework, the chief is a physical satellite responsible for all calculations, while in the distributed framework, the chief is treated as a virtual point mass orbiting the Earth, and each deputy performs its own guidance and control calculations onboard. The study emphasizes the spaceborne implementation of the closed-loop control system, aiming for a reliable and automated solution to the optimal control problem. To this end, the risk of infeasibility is mitigated through first identifying the constraints that pose a potential threat of infeasibility, then properly softening them. Two Model Predictive Control architectures are implemented and compared, namely, a shrinking-horizon and a fixed-horizon schemes. Performances, in terms of fuel expenditure and achieved control accuracy, are analyzed on typical close-range reconfigurations requested by Earth observation missions and are compared against different implementations proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Nanosatellite Design Considerations for a Mission to Explore the Propellant Sloshing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sloshing Platform for In-Orbit Controller Experimentation is an ambitious, student run mission to design and fly a cubesat to study fluid sloshing in spacecraft. The project will examine zero-g propellant sloshing from an experimental standpoint. Despite the small size and limited payload capacity, we intend to use the cubesat platform to mimic larger spacecraft and implement novel detection and computer vision methods in our analysis. Many modern spacecraft rely on propellant-filled tanks to perform attitude control and station-keeping maneuvers. When a large percentage of the spacecraft's mass is comprised of liquid propellant, sloshing becomes a critical aspect of spacecraft attitude control and stability. The mission will study the tank/fluid dynamics using new methods to gain an enhanced understanding of low-gravity fluid disturbance effects and improve simulations using equivalent mechanical models (EMMs). Active control of the fluid leading to the reduction of propellant slosh settling times will improve the maneuverability and performance of spacecraft. This paper will focus on satellite payload research and design requirements used to inform other aspects of the SPICEsat design. In this paper, mission objectives will be discussed, numerical simulations for the proposed control algorithms are demonstrated, and a satellite experiment design is presented. Finally, we examine computational fluid dynamics models to validate the satellite design and propellant sensing components of the proposed spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Highway Managed Lane Usage and Tolling for Mixed Traffic Flows with Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and High-Occupancy Vehicles (HOVs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates managed lane (ML) toll setting and its effect under mixed traffic of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), with a goal to avoid flow breakdown and minimize total social cost. A mesoscopic finite-difference traffic simulation model considers the flow-density relationship at different CAV market penetration rates, lane-changing behavior, and multiple entries/exits, interacting with a reactive toll setting mechanism. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation suggest an optimal policy of untolled HOV/CAV use with HDV tolls in particular scenarios of limited CAV market penetration. Small and targeted tolling avoids flow breakdown in ML while prioritizing HOVs and other vehicles with high values of time. Extensions of the formulation and sensitivity analysis quantify the benefits of converting high-occupancy HDVs to CAVs. The optimal tolling regime combines traffic science notions of flow stability and the economics of resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Wideband Double-Directional Channel Measurements and Statistical Modeling in Urban Microcellular Environments for the Upper-Midband/FR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper midband, designated as Frequency Range 3 (FR3), is increasingly critical for the next-generation of wireless networks. Channel propagation measurements and their statistical analysis are essential first steps towards this direction. This paper presents a comprehensive ultra-wideband (UWB) double-directional channel measurement campaign in a large portion of FR3 (6-14 GHz) for urban microcellular environments. We analyze over 25,000 directional power delay profiles and providing key insights into line-of-sight (LoS) and obstructed line-of-sight (OLoS) conditions. This is followed by statistical modeling of path loss, shadowing, delay spread and angular spread. As the first UWB double-directional measurement campaign in this frequency range, this work offers critical insights for spectrum allocation, channel modeling, and the design of advanced communication systems, paving the way for further exploration of FR3.</description>

      <title>Data-Based Efficient Off-Policy Stabilizing Optimal Control Algorithms for Discrete-Time Linear Systems via Damping Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy iteration is one of the classical frameworks of reinforcement learning, which requires a known initial stabilizing control. However, finding the initial stabilizing control depends on the known system model. To relax this requirement and achieve model-free optimal control, in this paper, two different reinforcement learning algorithms based on policy iteration and variable damping coefficients are designed for unknown discrete-time linear systems. First, a stable artificial system is designed, and this system is gradually iterated to the original system by varying the damping coefficients. This allows the initial stabilizing control to be obtained in a finite number of iteration steps. Then, an off-policy iteration algorithm and an off-policy $\mathcal{Q}$-learning algorithm are designed to select the appropriate damping coefficients and realize data-driven. In these two algorithms, the current estimates of optimal control gain are not applied to the system to re-collect data. Moreover, they are characterized by the fast convergence of the traditional policy iteration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Practical Implementation and Experimental Validation of an Optimal Control based Eco-Driving System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of Eco-Driving (ED) is to maximize energy efficiency. This study evaluates the energy gains of an ED system for an electric vehicle, obtained from a predictive optimal controller, in a real-world traffic scenario. To this end, a Visual driver Advisory System (VAS) in the form of a personal tablet is used to advise the driver to follow a target eco-speed via a screen. Two Renault Zoe electric cars, one equipped with the different modules for ED and one without, are used to perform field tests on a route between Rueil-Malmaison and Bougival in France. Overall, the ED consumed, on average, 4.6~$\%$ less energy than the non-eco-driven car with a maximum of 2~$\%$ change in average speed.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Multi-Device Cooperative Edge Inference with Distributed Resource Bidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) has empowered mobile devices (MDs) in supporting artificial intelligence (AI) applications through collaborative efforts with proximal MEC servers. Unfortunately, despite the great promise of device-edge cooperative AI inference, data privacy becomes an increasing concern. In this paper, we develop a privacy-aware multi-device cooperative edge inference system for classification tasks, which integrates a distributed bidding mechanism for the MEC server's computational resources. Intermediate feature compression is adopted as a principled approach to minimize data privacy leakage. To determine the bidding values and feature compression ratios in a distributed fashion, we formulate a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) model, for which, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in privacy-preserving cooperative edge inference. Specifically, given a sufficient level of data privacy protection, the proposed algorithm achieves 0.31-0.95% improvements in classification accuracy compared to the approach being agnostic to the wireless channel conditions. The performance is further enhanced by 1.54-1.67% by considering the difficulties of inference data.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Based Deep Neural Networks for Adaptive Control of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems involves substantial challenges when the dynamics contain unknown and unstructured nonlinear state-dependent terms. For such complex systems, deep neural networks can serve as powerful black box approximators for the unknown drift and diffusion processes. Recent developments construct Lyapunov-based deep neural network (Lb-DNN) controllers to compensate for deterministic uncertainties using adaptive weight update laws derived from a Lyapunov-based analysis based on insights from the compositional structure of the DNN architecture. However, these Lb-DNN controllers do not account for non-deterministic uncertainties. This paper develops Lb-DNNs to adaptively compensate for both the drift and diffusion uncertainties of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems. Through a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, a DNN-based approximation and corresponding DNN weight adaptation laws are constructed to eliminate the unknown state-dependent terms resulting from the nonlinear diffusion and drift processes. The tracking error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded in probability. Simulations are performed on a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system to show efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>LINKs: Large Language Model Integrated Management for 6G Empowered Digital Twin NetworKs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital twins (DT) and 6G networks, the integration of large language models (LLMs) presents a novel approach to network management. This paper explores the application of LLMs in managing 6G-empowered DT networks, with a focus on optimizing data retrieval and communication efficiency in smart city scenarios. The proposed framework leverages LLMs for intelligent DT problem analysis and radio resource management (RRM) in fully autonomous way without any manual intervention. Our proposed framework -- LINKs, builds up a lazy loading strategy which can minimize transmission delay by selectively retrieving the relevant data. Based on the data retrieval plan, LLMs transform the retrieval task into an numerical optimization problem and utilizing solvers to build an optimal RRM, ensuring efficient communication across the network. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvements in data planning and network management, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance the integration of DT and 6G technologies.</description>

Abstract: Preliminary spacecraft trajectory optimization is a parameter dependent global search problem that aims to provide a set of solutions that are of high quality and diverse. In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Convex Data-Driven Contraction With Riemannian Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of dynamical systems and advances in data collection necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming nonlinearities are lipschitz bounded in subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We extend the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its potential for robust data-driven contraction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Feedback Control for Global Navigation with Locally Optimal Obstacle Avoidance in n-Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid feedback control framework for autonomous robot navigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical obstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe navigation and global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the target location by dynamically switching between two operational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal obstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures collision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance maneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with range sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown environments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by experimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and robustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency and real-world feasibility.</description>

      <title>Slow and fast dynamics in measure functional differential equations with state-dependent delays through averaging principles and applications to extremum seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a new class of equations called measure functional differential equations with state-dependent delays. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions and present a discussion concerning the appropriate phase space to define these equations. Also, we prove a version of periodic averaging principle to these equations. This type of result was completely open in the literature. These equations involving measure bring the advantage to encompass others such as impulsive, dynamic equations on time scales and difference equations, expanding their application potential. Additionally, we apply our theoretical insights to a real-time optimization strategy, using extremum seeking to validate the stability of an innovative algorithm under state-dependent delays. This application confirm the relevance of our findings in practical scenarios, offering valuable tools for advanced control system design. Our research provides significant contributions to the mathematical field and suggests new directions for future technological developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel targeted exploration strategy designed specifically for uncertain linear time-invariant systems with energy-bounded disturbances, i.e., without making any assumptions on the distribution of the disturbances. We use classical results characterizing the set of non-falsified parameters consistent with energy-bounded disturbances. We derive a semidefinite program which computes an exploration strategy that guarantees a desired accuracy of the parameter estimate. This design is based on sufficient conditions on the spectral content of the exploration data that robustly accounts for initial parametric uncertainty. Finally, we highlight the applicability of the exploration strategy through a numerical example involving an unmodeled nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptive Platoon Control for Connected and Automated Vehicles via Physics Enhanced Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a physics enhanced residual learning (PERL) framework for connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon control, addressing the dynamics and unpredictability inherent to platoon systems. The framework first develops a physics-based controller to model vehicle dynamics, using driving speed as input to optimize safety and efficiency. Then the residual controller, based on neural network (NN) learning, enriches the prior knowledge of the physical model and corrects residuals caused by vehicle dynamics. By integrating the physical model with data-driven online learning, the PERL framework retains the interpretability and transparency of physics-based models and enhances the adaptability and precision of data-driven learning, achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and control accuracy in dynamic scenarios. Simulation and robot car platform tests demonstrate that PERL significantly outperforms pure physical and learning models, reducing average cumulative absolute position and speed errors by up to 58.5% and 40.1% (physical model) and 58.4% and 47.7% (NN model). The reduced-scale robot car platform tests further validate the adaptive PERL framework's superior accuracy and rapid convergence under dynamic disturbances, reducing position and speed cumulative errors by 72.73% and 99.05% (physical model) and 64.71% and 72.58% (NN model). PERL enhances platoon control performance through online parameter updates when external disturbances are detected. Results demonstrate the advanced framework's exceptional accuracy and rapid convergence capabilities, proving its effectiveness in maintaining platoon stability under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study of Passive UAV Tracking with Digital Arrays and Cellular Downlink Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the prospects of the low-altitude economy (LAE) and the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there are increasing demands on monitoring flying objects at low altitude in wide urban areas. In this work, the widely deployed long-term evolution (LTE) base station (BS) is exploited to illuminate UAVs in bistatic trajectory tracking. Specifically, a passive sensing receiver with two digital antenna arrays is proposed and developed to capture both the line-of-sight (LoS) signal and the scattered signal off a target UAV. From their cross ambiguity function, the bistatic range, Doppler shift and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the target UAV can be detected in a sequence of time slots. In order to address missed detections and false alarms of passive sensing, a multi-target tracking framework is adopted to track the trajectory of the target UAV. It is demonstrated by experiments that the proposed UAV tracking system can achieve a meter-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Potential detrimental effects of real-time route recommendations in traffic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigation apps have become pervasive in providing real-time route recommendations to travelers willing to minimize their travel times. However, such technologies introduce new complexities, raising concerns about their overall impact on traffic networks. This paper focuses on evaluating the effect of navigation apps on traffic flows, particularly examining how real-time route recommendations influence network efficiency and congestion. Using a dynamical network flow model, we study traffic dynamics between an origin-destination pair, where a fraction of drivers follow app recommendations while others rely on fixed route preferences. By incorporating supply-demand mechanisms to account for capacity and volume constraints on routes, we uncover partial demand transfer, i.e., only a portion of the traffic demand is able to traverse the network, while the rest builds up congestion at the origin. We prove that the dynamics converges to a globally stable equilibrium and we provide a detailed analysis of this equilibrium when the choices of the informed drivers follow a logit model, correlating the emergence of partial demand transfer to the penetration rate of navigation apps among users.</description>

      <title>Learning with Delayed Payoffs in Population Games using Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent decision problem in large population games. Agents from multiple populations select strategies for repeated interactions with one another. At each stage of these interactions, agents use their decision-making model to revise their strategy selections based on payoffs determined by an underlying game. Their goal is to learn the strategies that correspond to the Nash equilibrium of the game. However, when games are subject to time delays, conventional decision-making models from the population game literature may result in oscillations in the strategy revision process or convergence to an equilibrium other than the Nash. To address this problem, we propose the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model, along with an algorithm that iteratively updates the model's regularization parameter across a network of communicating agents. Using passivity-based convergence analysis techniques, we show that the KLD-RL model achieves convergence to the Nash equilibrium without oscillations, even for a class of population games that are subject to time delays. We demonstrate our main results numerically on a two-population congestion game and a two-population zero-sum game.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Fast Optimisation in Model Predictive Control: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control algorithm with strong stability and robustness guarantees. Despite its popularity in robotics and industrial applications, the main challenge in deploying MPC is its high computation cost, stemming from the need to solve an optimisation problem at each control interval. There are several methods to reduce this cost. This survey focusses on approaches where a neural network is used to approximate an existing controller. Herein, relevant and unique neural approximation methods for linear, nonlinear, and robust MPC are presented and compared. Comparisons are based on the theoretical guarantees that are preserved, the factor by which the original controller is sped up, and the size of problem that a framework is applicable to. Research contributions include: a taxonomy that organises existing knowledge, a summary of literary gaps, discussion on promising research directions, and simple guidelines for choosing an approximation framework. The main conclusions are that (1) new benchmarking tools are needed to help prove the generalisability and scalability of approximation frameworks, (2) future breakthroughs most likely lie in the development of ties between control and learning, and (3) the potential and applicability of recently developed neural architectures and tools remains unexplored in this field.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-time adaptive fuzzy tracking control problem for a class of pure-feedback system with full-state constraints. With the help of Mean-Value Theorem, the pure-feedback nonlinear system is transformed into strict-feedback case. By employing finite-time-stable like function and state transformation for output tracking error, the output tracking error converges to a predefined set in a fixed finite interval. To tackle the problem of state constraints, integral Barrier Lyapunov functions are utilized to guarantee that the state variables remain within the prescribed constraints with feasibility check. Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. In addition, all the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be semi-global ultimately uniformly bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Fuzzy Tracking Control for Nonlinear State Constrained Pure-Feedback Systems With Input Delay via Dynamic Surface Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This brief constructs the adaptive backstepping control scheme for a class of pure-feedback systems with input delay and full state constraints. With the help of Mean Value Theorem, the pure-feedback system is transformed into strict-feedback one. Barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to guarantee all of the states remain constrained within predefined sets. By introducing the Pade approximation method and corresponding intermediate, the impact generated by input delay on the output tracking performance of the system can be eliminated. Furthermore, a low-pass filter driven by a newly-defined control input, is employed to generate the actual control input, which facilitates the design of backstepping control. To approximate the unknown functions with a desired level of accuracy, the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilized by choosing appropriate fuzzy rules, logics and so on. The minimal learning parameter (MLP) technique is employed to decrease the number of nodes and parameters in FLSs, and dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is leveraged to avoid so-called "explosion of complexity". Moreover, smooth robust compensators are introduced to circumvent the influences of external disturbance and approximation errors. By stability analysis, it is proved that all of signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately uniform bounded, and the tracking error can be within a arbitrary small neighbor of origin via selecting appropriate parameters of controllers. Finally, the results of numerical illustration are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed method.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Population Games And Perturbed Best Response Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to mitigate epidemic spread in a population of strategic agents by encouraging safer behaviors through carefully designed rewards. These rewards, which adapt to the evolving state of the epidemic, are ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents' strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic's spread rate is influenced by the time scale of the payoff mechanism's dynamics. Additionally, we derive anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing us to quantify the trade-off between peak infection prevalence and the corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.</description>

      <title>Timing Analysis and Priority-driven Enhancements of ROS 2 Multi-threaded Executors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second generation of Robotic Operating System, ROS 2, has gained much attention for its potential to be used for safety-critical robotic applications. The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and scheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some pioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of processing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded executors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not been studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2 multi-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default scheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present priority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the default scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and constrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback groups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and schedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results demonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times under various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not only reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical bounds.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</description>

      <title>Recommender systems and reinforcement learning for human-building interaction and context-aware support: A text mining-driven review of scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The indoor environment significantly impacts human health and well-being; enhancing health and reducing energy consumption in these settings is a central research focus. With the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL) have emerged as promising approaches to induce behavioral changes to improve the indoor environment and energy efficiency of buildings. This study aims to employ text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to thoroughly examine the connections among these approaches in the context of human-building interaction and occupant context-aware support. The study analyzed 27,595 articles from the ScienceDirect database, revealing extensive use of recommendation systems and RL for space optimization, location recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Although these systems are broadly applied to specific content, their use in optimizing indoor environments and energy efficiency remains limited. This gap likely arises from the need for interdisciplinary knowledge and extensive sensor data. Traditional recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based and knowledge-based methods, are commonly employed. However, the more complex challenges of optimizing indoor conditions and energy efficiency often depend on sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques like reinforcement and deep learning. Furthermore, this review underscores the vast potential for expanding recommender systems and RL applications in buildings and indoor environments. Fields ripe for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendation, and optimization of environments tailored for specific needs, such as sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.13306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To solve the problem of power supply limitation of machines working in wireless industry automation, we evaluated the workload aware service rate control design implanted in the medium access control component of these small devices and proposed a bio-intelligence based algorithm to optimise the design regarding the delay constraint while minimizing power consumption. To achieve this, we provide an accurate analysis of the delay cost of this design and for the first time pinpoint an exact departure process model in order to evaluate the overall delay cost in consideration of the medium access time.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Upper Confidence Bound Algorithms for Homogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10933v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a decentralized homogeneous multi-armed bandit problem in a multi-agent network. The problem is simultaneously solved by $N$ agents assuming they face a common set of $M$ arms and share the same arms' reward distributions. Each agent can receive information only from its neighbors, where the neighbor relationships among the agents are described by a fixed graph. Two fully decentralized upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms are proposed for undirected graphs, respectively based on the classic algorithm and the state-of-the-art Kullback-Leibler upper confidence bound (KL-UCB) algorithm. The proposed decentralized UCB1 and KL-UCB algorithms permit each agent in the network to achieve a better logarithmic asymptotic regret than their single-agent counterparts, provided that the agent has at least one neighbor, and the more neighbors an agent has, the better regret it will have, meaning that the sum is more than its component parts. The same algorithm design framework is also extended to directed graphs through the design of a variant of the decentralized UCB1 algorithm, which outperforms the single-agent UCB1 algorithm.</description>

      <title>Online Learning and Control for Data-Augmented Quadrotor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to adapt to changing conditions is a key feature of a successful autonomous system. In this work, we use the Recursive Gaussian Processes (RGP) for identification of the quadrotor air drag model online, without the need of training data. The identified drag model then augments a physics-based model of the quadrotor dynamics, which allows more accurate quadrotor state prediction with increased ability to adapt to changing conditions. This data-augmented physics-based model is utilized for precise quadrotor trajectory tracking using the suitably modified Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The proposed modelling and control approach is evaluated using the Gazebo simulator and it is shown that the proposed approach tracks a desired trajectory with a higher accuracy compared to the MPC with the non-augmented (purely physics-based) model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Importance Learning using Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for Nonlinear Dynamic Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding output variance is critical in modeling nonlinear dynamic systems, as it reflects the system's sensitivity to input variations and feature interactions. This work presents a methodology for dynamically determining relevance scores in black-box models while ensuring interpretability through an embedded decision module. This interpretable module, integrated into the first layer of the model, employs the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and logistic regression to compute relevance scores, interpreted as the probabilities of input neurons being active based on their contribution to the output variance. The proposed method leverages a gradient-based framework to uncover the importance of variance-driven features, capturing both individual contributions and complex feature interactions. These relevance scores are applied through element-wise transformations of the inputs, enabling the black-box model to prioritize features dynamically based on their impact on system output. This approach effectively bridges interpretability with the intricate modeling of nonlinear dynamics and time-dependent interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the method's ability to infer feature interactions while achieving superior performance in feature relevance compared to existing techniques. The practical utility of this approach is showcased through its application to an industrial pH neutralization process, where critical system dynamics are uncovered.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Overview of Reward Engineering and Shaping in Advancing Reinforcement Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world applications is to create systems capable of making autonomous decisions by learning from their environment through trial and error. This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Control and Dynamical Structure of Global Trajectory Search Problems with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacecraft trajectory design is a global search problem, where previous work has revealed specific solution structures that can be captured with data-driven methods. This paper explores two global search problems in the circular restricted three-body problem: hybrid cost function of minimum fuel/time-of-flight and transfers to energy-dependent invariant manifolds. These problems display a fundamental structure either in the optimal control profile or the use of dynamical structures. We build on our prior generative machine learning framework to apply diffusion models to learn the conditional probability distribution of the search problem and analyze the model's capability to capture these structures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.</description>
