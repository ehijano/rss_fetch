      <title>Optimizing Surgical Plans for Parenchyma-Sparing Liver Resections through Contour-Guided Resection and Surface Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This study introduces a novel method for defining virtual resections in liver cancer surgery, aimed at enhancing the adaptability of parenchyma-sparing resection (PSR) plans. By comparing these with traditional anatomical resection (AR) plans, we explore the potential for optimization in surgical planning. Methods: Leveraging contours and spline surface approximations directly from the liver's surface, our method aligns closely with actual surgical procedures, offering a more realistic representation of curved resection paths. This technique, tested against 14 cases from the OSLO-COMET study, incorporates surface deformation for versatile plan modeling, comparing volumetric outcomes of PSR and AR. Results: The study highlights significant benefits of PSR over AR, including reduced resected volume ($32.71 \pm 13.80$ ml for PSR vs. $249.53 \pm 135.23$ ml for AR, $p &lt;0.0001$) and higher remnant liver volume ($1922.77 \pm 442.86$ ml for PSR vs. $1716.87 \pm 403.00$ ml for AR, $p &lt;0.0001$). PSR also showed a considerably higher remnant percentage ($98.16 \pm 0.81%$) compared to AR ($87.40 \pm 6.49%$, $p &lt;0.0001$). Conclusion: The proposed approach is able to define virtual resections accommodating a wide variety of resections (i.e., PSR and AR). Careful surgical planning using virtual resections can optimize the resection strategy. Significance: This study presents a novel computer-aided planning system for liver surgery, demonstrating its efficacy and flexibility for definition of virtual resections. Virtual surgery planning can be used for optimization of resection strategies leading to increased preservation of healthy tissue.</description>

      <title>Real-time Adaptive and Localized Spatiotemporal Clutter Filtering for Ultrasound Small Vessel Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective clutter filtering is crucial in suppressing tissue clutter and extracting blood flow signal in Doppler ultrasound. Recent advances in eigen-based clutter filtering techniques have enabled ultrasound imaging of microvasculature without the need for contrast agents. However, simultaneously achieving fully adaptive, highly sensitive and real-time implementation of such eigen-based filtering techniques in clinical scanning scenarios for broad translation remains challenging. To address this, here we propose a fast spatiotemporal clutter filtering technique based on eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and a novel localized data processing framework for robust and high-definition ultrasound imaging of blood flow. Unlike the existing local clutter filter that hard splits the ultrasound data into small blocks, our approach applies a series of 2D spatial Gaussian windows to the original data to generate local data subsets. This approach improves performance of flow detection while effectively avoiding undesired grid artifacts with dramatically reduced number of subsets required in local EVD filtering to shorten computation time. By leveraging the computational power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), we demonstrate the real-time implementation capability of the proposed approach. We also introduce and systematically evaluate several adaptive and automatic eigenvalue thresholding methods tailored for EVD-based filtering to facilitate optimization of blood flow imaging for either global or localized processing. The feasibility of the proposed clutter filtering technique is validated by experimental results from phantom and different in vivo studies, revealing robust clinical application potential. A tradeoff between improved performance and computational cost associated with the packet size and subset number in local processing is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Permittivity Characterization of Human Skin Based on a Quasi-optical System at Sub-THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to experimentally characterize effective human skin permittivity at sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies, specifically from $140$~to $210$~GHz, utilizing a quasi-optical measurement system. To ensure accurate measurement of the reflection coefficients of human skin, a planar, rigid, and thick reference plate with a low-loss dielectric is utilized to flatten the human skin surface. A permittivity characterization method is proposed to reduce permittivity estimation deviations resulting from the pressure effects on the phase displacements of skins under the measurements but also to ensure repeatability of the measurement. In practical permittivity characterizations, the complex permittivities of the finger, palm, and arm of seven volunteers show small standard deviations for the repeated measurements, respectively, while those show significant variations across different regions of the skins and for different persons. The proposed measurement system holds significant potential for future skin permittivity estimation in sub-THz bands, facilitating further studies on human-electromagnetic-wave interactions based on the measured permittivity values.</description>

      <title>Histotripsy of blood clots within a hollow cylindrical transducer for aspiration thrombectomy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thrombolytic occlusions in stroke, pulmonary embolism and the peripheral vasculature are increasingly treated with aspiration, a catheter-based approach that employs suction to extract clots through a hollow catheter lumen. Unfortunately, aspiration is frequently unsuccessful in extracting more challenging clots, which can become corked in the distal tip. We hypothesize that clot extraction can be enhanced by using histotripsy to degrade the mechanical integrity of clot material within the lumen of a hollow cylindrical transducer which can be situated at the tip of an aspiration catheter. To demonstrate the feasibility of degrading clot material within the lumen of a hollow cylindrical transducer, the effect of pulsing schemes on lesion generation within clots was assessed using a retracted clot model. A radially polarized cylindrical transducer (2.5 mm and 3.3 mm for inner and outer diameter, 2.5 mm length, PZT) working at 6.1 MHz was used to degrade retracted porcine clots with pulse lengths of 10, 20, and 100 us, pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) of 100, 500, and 1000 Hz, using treatment times from 0.1 to 10 seconds (n = 5 clots per condition). 3D ultrasound scans and bisected optical examinations of treated clots confirmed the formation of liquified zones. Lesions could form within 0.1 seconds along the central axis of the transducer and then grow in diameter and length over time. The lesion volume was found to be highly dependent on the exposure scheme, with the largest lesion volume associated with the 10 us pulse length 1000 kHz PRF case. Collectively these results demonstrate the feasibility of degrading blood clots within hollow cylindrical transducers, which suggests their potential for enhancing aspiration based mechanical thrombectomy.</description>

      <title>From Generalist to Specialist: Improving Large Language Models for Medical Physics Using ARCoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their application in specialized fields, such as medical physics, remains challenging due to the need for domain-specific knowledge. This study introduces ARCoT (Adaptable Retrieval-based Chain of Thought), a framework designed to enhance the domain-specific accuracy of LLMs without requiring fine-tuning or extensive retraining. ARCoT integrates a retrieval mechanism to access relevant domain-specific information and employs step-back and chain-of-thought prompting techniques to guide the LLM's reasoning process, ensuring more accurate and context-aware responses. Benchmarking on a medical physics multiple-choice exam, our model outperformed standard LLMs and reported average human performance, demonstrating improvements of up to 68% and achieving a high score of 90%. This method reduces hallucinations and increases domain-specific performance. The versatility and model-agnostic nature of ARCoT make it easily adaptable to various domains, showcasing its significant potential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in specialized fields.</description>

      <title>Advancing fNIRS Neuroimaging through Synthetic Data Generation and Machine Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an integrated approach for advancing functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging through the synthesis of data and application of machine learning models. By addressing the scarcity of high-quality neuroimaging datasets, this work harnesses Monte Carlo simulations and parametric head models to generate a comprehensive synthetic dataset, reflecting a wide spectrum of conditions. We developed a containerized environment employing Docker and Xarray for standardized and reproducible data analysis, facilitating meaningful comparisons across different signal processing modalities. Additionally, a cloud-based infrastructure is established for scalable data generation and processing, enhancing the accessibility and quality of neuroimaging data. The combination of synthetic data generation with machine learning techniques holds promise for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of fNIRS tomography, potentially revolutionizing diagnostics and treatment strategies for neurological conditions. The methodologies and infrastructure developed herein set new standards in data simulation and analysis, paving the way for future research in neuroimaging and the broader biomedical engineering field.</description>

      <title>Quality assurance of organs-at-risk delineation in radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The delineation of tumor target and organs-at-risk is critical in the radiotherapy treatment planning. Automatic segmentation can be used to reduce the physician workload and improve the consistency. However, the quality assurance of the automatic segmentation is still an unmet need in clinical practice. The patient data used in our study was a standardized dataset from AAPM Thoracic Auto-Segmentation Challenge. The OARs included were left and right lungs, heart, esophagus, and spinal cord. Two groups of OARs were generated, the benchmark dataset manually contoured by experienced physicians and the test dataset automatically created using a software AccuContour. A resnet-152 network was performed as feature extractor, and one-class support vector classifier was used to determine the high or low quality. We evaluate the model performance with balanced accuracy, F-score, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiving operator characteristic curve. We randomly generated contour errors to assess the generalization of our method, explored the detection limit, and evaluated the correlations between detection limit and various metrics such as volume, Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and mean surface distance. The proposed one-class classifier outperformed in metrics such as balanced accuracy, AUC, and others. The proposed method showed significant improvement over binary classifiers in handling various types of errors. Our proposed model, which introduces residual network and attention mechanism in the one-class classification framework, was able to detect the various types of OAR contour errors with high accuracy. The proposed method can significantly reduce the burden of physician review for contour delineation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the vulnerability of space habitats to cosmic radiation, which consists of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, raises important safety concerns for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation consists of experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators, marking a notable advancement in this field. Intriguingly, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth offer potential solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. Additionally, we recommend assessing the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing quality and speed in database-free neural network reconstructions of undersampled MRI with SCAMPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08143v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: We present SCAMPI (Sparsity Constrained Application of deep Magnetic resonance Priors for Image reconstruction), an untrained deep Neural Network for MRI reconstruction without previous training on datasets. It expands the Deep Image Prior approach with a multidomain, sparsity-enforcing loss function to achieve higher image quality at a faster convergence speed than previously reported methods. Methods: Two-dimensional MRI data from the FastMRI dataset with Cartesian undersampling in phase-encoding direction were reconstructed for different acceleration rates for single coil and multicoil data. Results: The performance of our architecture was compared to state-of-the-art Compressed Sensing methods and ConvDecoder, another untrained Neural Network for two-dimensional MRI reconstruction. SCAMPI outperforms these by better reducing undersampling artifacts and yielding lower error metrics in multicoil imaging. In comparison to ConvDecoder, the U-Net architecture combined with an elaborated loss-function allows for much faster convergence at higher image quality. SCAMPI can reconstruct multicoil data without explicit knowledge of coil sensitivity profiles. Moreover, it is a novel tool for reconstructing undersampled single coil k-space data. Conclusion: Our approach avoids overfitting to dataset features, that can occur in Neural Networks trained on databases, because the network parameters are tuned only on the reconstruction data. It allows better results and faster reconstruction than the baseline untrained Neural Network approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering of light by biological tissue has hindered applications of spectroscopy to medical diagnosis. We describe here a combination of feature selection techniques and several discriminant statistics that may mitigate this problem. In the particular case of spectroscopy, a useful feature should have linewidth, which in practice means that the discriminant statistic should have significant values on several contiguous pixels of the detector. We also suggest a definition for optical taxonomic signal as a measure of how efficacious a particular combination may be and how much other variables such as source-detector separation and fiber width may affect discrimination.</description>

      <title>Microstructural investigation of hybrid CAD/CAM restorative dental materials by micro-CT and SEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: An increasing number of CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) hybrid materials have been introduced to the dental market in recent years. In addition, CAD/CAM hybrid materials for additive manufacturing (AM) are becoming more attractive in digital dentistry. Studies on material microstructures using micro-computed tomography ($\mu$-CT) combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have only been available to a limited extent so far.
  Methods: One CAD/CAM three-dimensional- (3D-) printable hybrid material (VarseoSmile Crown plus) and two CAD/CAM millable hybrid materials (Vita Enamic; Voco Grandio), as well as one direct composite material (Ceram.x duo), were included in the present study. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 2 mm were produced from each material and investigated by means of synchrotron radiation $\mu$-CT at a voxel size of 0.65 $\mu$m. Different samples from the same materials, obtained by cutting and polishing, were investigated by SEM.
  Results: The 3D-printed hybrid material showed some agglomerations and a more irregular distribution of fillers, as well as a visible layered macrostructure and a few spherical pores due to the printing process. The CAD/CAM millable hybrid materials revealed a more homogenous distribution of ceramic particles. The direct composite material showed multiple air bubbles and microstructural irregularities based on manual processing.
  Significance: The $\mu$-CT and SEM analysis of the materials revealed different microstructures even though they belong to the same class of materials. It could be shown that $\mu$-CT and SEM imaging are valuable tools to understand microstructure and related mechanical properties of materials.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for a variety of clinical applications. However, acoustic inhomogeneities within the skull cause significant wave interactions, leading to difficulties in predicting the energy delivered to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure attenuation was $3.1 \pm 1.4$ dB, $9.0 \pm 1.7$ dB, and $14.6 \pm 4.1$ dB, respectively. The average power attenuation was $5.0 \pm 2.4$ dB, $14.9 \pm 3.2$ dB, and $24.1 \pm 6.3$ dB, respectively. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure and power was investigated and linear fits produced. Our results demonstrate that Thiel-embalmed samples fall within the confidence intervals of fits for historical samples. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Results indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>
