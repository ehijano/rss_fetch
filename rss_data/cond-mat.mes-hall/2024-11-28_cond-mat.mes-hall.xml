      <title>Topological finite size effect in one-dimensional chiral symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter have been widely studied for their robustness against impurities and disorder. The broad applicability of topological materials relies on the reliable transition from idealized, mathematically perfect models to finite, real-world implementations. In this paper, we explore the effects of finite size and disorders on topological properties. We propose a new criterion for characterizing finite topological systems based on the bulk conductivity of topological edge modes. We analyze the behavior of bulk conductivity and real space topological invariants both analytically and numerically for the family of SSH models. We show that our approach offers practical insights for topology determination in contemporary intermediate scale experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Spin flip locking by the tunneling and relaxation in a driven double quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled spin evolution and tunneling together with the relaxation and decoherence effects are studied for the double quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire and driven by the periodic electric field. Such system represents a model of the spin and charge qubits interacting via the strong spin-orbit coupling. It is found that at certain regimes the combination of fast relaxation in the coordinate channel with the slower relaxation in the spin channel leads to the promising combination of fast spin manipulation and slow spin relaxation, locking the flipped spin in an excited state in one of the dots for a sufficiently long time. The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.</description>

      <title>Disentangling morphology and conductance in amorphous graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Realization of a one-dimensional topological insulator in ultrathin germanene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing a one-dimensional (1D) topological insulator and identifying the lower dimensional limit of two-dimensional (2D) behavior are crucial steps toward developing high-density quantum state networks, advancing topological quantum computing, and exploring dimensionality effects in topological materials. Although 2D topological insulators have been experimentally realized, their lower dimensional limit and 1D counterparts remain elusive. Here, we fabricated and characterized arrays of zigzag-terminated germanene nanoribbons, a 2D topological insulator with a large topological bulk gap. The electronic properties of these nanoribbons strongly depend on their width, with topological edge states persisting down to a critical width (approx. 2 nm), defining the limit of 2D topology. Below this threshold, contrary to the tenfold way classification, we observe zero-dimensional (0D) states localized at the ends of the ultrathin nanoribbons. These end states, topologically protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries, mark the first realization of a 1D topological insulator with strong spin-orbit coupling. Our findings establish germanene nanoribbons as a platform for investigating 1D topology and dimensionality effects in topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and verification of mumax+, an extensible GPUaccelerated micromagnetic simulator with a Python user interface. It is a general solver for the space- and time-dependent evolution of the magnetization and related vector quantities, using a finite-difference discretization. In this work, we test the new features of mumax+, which are antiferromagnetism and elasticity, against several theoretical models including a dispersion relation for (elastic) antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the chiral anomaly. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ are constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios -- the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of the same pseudospin variety or of two distinct pseudospin-representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Shift spin photocurrents in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of nonlinear spin photocurrents by circularly polarized light in two-dimensional systems is theoretically investigated by calculating the shift spin conductivities. In time-reversal symmetric systems, shift spin photocurrent can be generated under the irradiation of circularly polarized light , while the shift charge photoccurrent is forbidden by symmetry. We show that $k$-cubic Rashba-Dresselhaus system, the $k$-cubic Wurtzite system and Dirac surface states can support the shift spin photocurrent. By symmetry analysis, it is found that in the Rashba type spin-orbit coupled systems, mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent are parallel, which we name as longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. The Dirac surface states with warping term exhibit mirror symmetry, similar to the Rashba type system, and support longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. In contrast, in the Dresselhaus type spin-orbit coupled systems, the parity-mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent are perpendicular, which we dub as transverse shift spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we find that the shift spin photocurrent always vanishes in any $k$-linear spin-orbit coupled system unless the Zeeman coupling is turned on. We find that the splitting of degenerate energy bands due to Zeeman coupling $\mu_z$ causes the van Hove singularity. The resulting shift spin conductivity has a significant peak at optical frequency $\omega=2\mu_z/\hbar$.</description>

      <title>Second-order correlation and squeezing of photons in cavities with ultrastrong magnon-photon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultra-strong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhance the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and imposes a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade and quantum information processing in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Topological Magnons on the Ferromagnetic Zigzag Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental identification of magnetic compounds consisting of zigzag chains, we analyze the band structure topology of magnons in ferromagnets on a zigzag lattice. We account for the general lattice geometry by including spatially anisotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions and by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on inversion asymmetric bonds. Within the linear spin-wave theory, we find two magnon branches, whose band structure topology (i.e., Chern numbers) we map out in a comprehensive phase diagram. Notably, besides topologically trivial and gapless phases, we identify topologically nontrivial phases that support chiral edge magnons. We show that these edge states are robust against elastic defect scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive semiclassical Boltzmann equations describing thermalization of an ensemble of excitons due to exciton-phonon interactions taking into account the fact that excitons are not ideal bosons but composite particles consisting of electrons and holes. We demonstrate that with a standard definition of excitonic creation and annihilation operators, one faces a problem of the total particle number nonconservation and propose its possible solution based on the introduction of operators with angular momentum algebra. We then derive a set of kinetic equations describing the evolution of the excitonic density in the reciprocal space and analyze how the composite statistics of the excitons affects the thermalization processes in the system.</description>

      <title>Robust translational invariance in topological bands against lattice potentials and disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically show that the continuous magnetic translational invariance within the Hilbert (sub-)space of a single Landau level (LL) can persist even in the presence of a superlattice electrostatic potential modulation, while such invariance is broken in the full real-space Hilbert space. This is due to the interplay of the superlattice constant and the fundamental length scale of the quantum Hall fluids. In particular for the lowest LL (LLL), when the spacing of superlattice is below the magnetic length, continuous magnetic translational symmetry is very robust. For the fractional quantum Hall phases, the continuous translational symmetry is preserved when the superlattice spacing is below the corresponding fundamental lengths which we can now quantitatively define, which is different from the length scale from the quantum metric. Moreover, our analysis implies that the dynamics of the anyonic excitations can be robust against the long wavelength part of the disorder, and we discuss the related experimental ramifications.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Forces in Photon-Medium Interactions Using Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines dissipative forces in photon-medium interactions through time-independent perturbation theory, with a specific focus on single Helium-4 atoms. Utilizing a Hamiltonian framework, energy corrections induced by dissipative gravitational frictional effects in low-density systems are derived and analyzed as a function of inter-atomic distance. The calculations reveal an energy correction peak at $r_1 = 0.1 nm$, followed by rapid exponential decay, highlighting the dominance of nonlinear dissipative effects at nanoscale separations. These findings emphasize the critical role of short-range interactions, governed by the de-Broglie wavelength of Helium-4, and provide a rigorous theoretical basis for understanding photon-medium interactions at quantum scales. This novel single-particle approach departs from macroscopic mean-field models, offering unique insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying energy dissipation. The results have potential implications for advancing quantum information processing, nonlinear optics, and the study of dissipative mechanisms in quantum fluids. Experimental validation of the theoretical predictions is proposed using state-of-the-art techniques in optical media, levitated nanoparticle systems, and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Probing topological degeneracy on a torus using superconducting altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of topological order (TO) can be defined through the characteristic ground state degeneracy of a system placed on a manifold with non-zero genus $g$, such as a torus. This ground state degeneracy has served as a key tool for identifying TOs in theoretical calculations but it has never been possible to probe experimentally because fabricating a device in the requisite toroidal geometry is generally not feasible. Here we discuss a practical method that can be used to overcome this difficulty in a class of topologically ordered systems that consist of a TO and its time reversal conjugate $\overline{\rm TO}$. The key insight is that a system possessing such ${\rm TO}\otimes\overline{\rm TO}$ order fabricated on an annulus behaves effectively as TO on a torus, provided that one supplies a symmetry-breaking perturbation that gaps out the edge modes. We illustrate this general principle using a specific example of a spin-polarized $p_x\pm ip_y$ chiral superconductor which is closely related to the Moore-Read Pfaffian fractional quantum Hall state. Specifically, we introduce a simple model with altermagnetic normal state which, in the presence of an attractive interaction, hosts a helical $(p_x-ip_y)^\uparrow\otimes(p_x+ip_y)^\downarrow$ superconducting ground state. We demonstrate that when placed on an annulus with the appropriate symmetry-breaking edge perturbation this planar two-dimensional system, remarkably, exhibits the same pattern of ground state degeneracy as a $p_x+ ip_y$ superconductor on a torus. We discuss broader implications of this behavior and ways it can be tested experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Field-free Josephson diode effect in interacting chiral quantum dot junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free Josephson diode (JD) based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan anomaly using holography, finding that the $U(1)$ axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We also compute the thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term, revealing its characteristic $T^2$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Spin shuttling in a silicon double quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.03598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of quantum information between different nodes of a quantum device is among the challenging functionalities of a quantum processor. In the context of spin qubits, this requirement can be met by coherent electron spin shuttling between semiconductor quantum dots. Here we theoretically study a minimal version of spin shuttling between two quantum dots. To this end, we analyze the dynamics of an electron during a detuning sweep in a silicon double quantum dot (DQD) occupied by one electron. Possibilities and limitations of spin transport are investigated. Spin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect in an inhomogeneous magnetic field play an important role for spin shuttling and are included in our model. Interactions that couple the position, spin and valley degrees of freedom open a number of avoided crossings in the spectrum allowing for diabatic transitions and interfering paths. The outcomes of single and repeated spin shuttling protocols are explored by means of numerical simulations and an approximate analytical model based on the solution of the Landau--Zener problem. We find that a spin infidelity as low as $1-F_s\lesssim 0.002$ with a relatively fast level velocity of $\alpha = 600\, {\mu}$eV/ns is feasible for optimal choices of parameters or by making use of constructive interference.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a cavity-induced measurement of the exchange coupling in quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spin qubit arrays the exchange coupling can be harnessed to implement two-qubit gates and to realize intermediate-range qubit connectivity along a spin bus. In this work, we propose a scheme to characterize the exchange coupling between electrons in adjacent quantum dots. We investigate theoretically the transmission of a microwave resonator coupled to a triple quantum dot (TQD) occupied by two electrons. We assume that the right quantum dot (QD) is always occupied by one electron while the second electron can tunnel between the left and center QD. If the two electrons are in adjacent dots they interact via the exchange coupling. By means of analytical calculations we show that the transmission profile of the resonator directly reveals the value of the exchange coupling strength between two electrons. From perturbation theory up to second order we conclude that the exchange can still be identified in the presence of magnetic gradients. A valley splitting comparable to the inter-dot tunnel coupling will lead to further modifications of the cavity transmission dips that also depend on the valley phases.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Pauli blockade with electron-photon coupling in quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both quantum transport measurements in the Pauli blockade regime and microwave cavity transmission measurements are important tools for spin-qubit readout and characterization. Based on a generalized input-output theory we derive a theoretical framework to investigate how a double quantum dot (DQD) in a transport setup interacts with a coupled microwave resonator while the current through the DQD is rectified by Pauli blockade. We show that the output field of the resonator can be used to infer the leakage current and thus obtain insight into the blockade mechanisms. In the case of a silicon DQD, we show how the valley quasi-degeneracy can impose limitations on this scheme. We also demonstrate that a large number of unknown DQD parameters including (but not limited to) the valley splitting can be estimated from the resonator response simultaneous to a transport experiment, providing more detailed knowledge about the microscopic environment of the DQD. Furthermore, we describe and quantify a back-action of the resonator photons on the steady state leakage current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a paradigm of multiplexed dispersive qubit measurement performed while the qubits dephase. A Laplace transformation of the time-dependent cavity response allows to separate contributions from multiple qubits coupled to the same resonator mode, thus allowing for simultaneous single-shot read out. With realistic parameters for silicon spin qubits we find a competitive readout fidelity, while the measurement time compares favourably to conventional dispersive readout. We extend the multiplexed readout method to quantum non-demolition measurements using auxiliary qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Chirality of Vibrational Modes in Helical Molecular Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16352v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of quantitative methods for studying chirality has stunted our theoretical understanding of chirality-induced physical phenomena. The chiral phonon has been proposed to be involved in various physical phenomena, but it is not yet well defined mathematically. Here we examine two approaches for assigning and quantifying the chirality of molecular normal modes in double-helical molecular wires with various levels of twist. First, associating with each normal mode a structure obtained by imposing the corresponding motion on a common atomic origin, we apply the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to quantitatively assess the relationship between the chirality-weighted normal mode spectrum and the chirality of the underlying molecular structure. We find that increasing the amount of twist in the double helix shifts the mean normal mode CCM to drastically higher values, implying that the chirality of molecular normal modes is strongly correlated with that of the underlying molecular structure. Second, we assign to each normal mode a pseudoscaler defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms, and we analyze the handedness of the normal mode spectrum with respect to this quantity. We find that twisting the double-chain structure introduces asymmetry between right and left-handed normal modes so that in twisted structures different frequency bands are characterized by distinct handedness. This may give rise to global phenomena such as thermal chirality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking and more recently entanglement are two cornerstones of quantum matter. We introduce the notion of anisotropic entanglement ordered phases, where the spatial profile of spin-pseudospin entanglement spontaneously lowers the four-fold rotational symmetry of the underlying crystal to a two-fold one, while the charge density retains the full symmetry. The resulting phases, which we term $\textit{entanglement smectic}$ and $\textit{entanglement stripe}$, exhibit a rich Goldstone mode spectrum and a set of phase transitions as a function of underlying anisotropies. We discuss experimental consequences of such anisotropic entanglement phases distinguishing them from more conventional charge or spin stripes. Our discussion of this interplay between entanglement and spontaneous symmetry breaking focuses on multicomponent quantum Hall systems realizing textured Wigner crystals, as may occur in graphene or possibly also in moir\'e systems, highlighting the rich landscape and properties of possible entanglement ordered phases.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturization of integrated circuits is facing an obstruction due to the escalating electrical resistivity of conventional copper interconnects. The underlying reason for this problem was unveiled by Fuchs and Sondheimer, who showed that thinner wires are more resistive because current-carrying electrons encounter the rough surfaces of the wire more frequently therein. Here, we present a generalization of the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory to Dirac and Weyl materials, which are candidates for next-generation interconnects. We predict a nonlinear longitudinal electric current originating from the combined action of the Berry curvature and non-specular surface-scattering.</description>

Abstract: Despite many reports of valley-related phenomena in graphene and its multilayers, current transport experiments cannot probe valley phenomena without the application of external fields. Here we propose a gate-defined valley splitter as a direct transport probe for valley phenomenon in graphene multilayers. First, we show how the device works, its magnetotransport response, and its robustness against fabrication errors. Secondly, we present two applications for valley splitters: (i) resonant tunneling of quantum dots probed by a valley splitter shows the valley polarization of dot levels; (ii) a combination of two valley splitters resolves the nature of order parameters in mesoscopic samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</description>

Abstract: Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian band structures, exceptional points generically form gapless lines or loops that give rise to extensively many defective eigenstates. In this work, we investigate how they non-trivially contribute to higher-order nonlinear responses by introducing unique singularities in the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) or Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Using a tilted 2D dissipative Dirac model ansatz that harbors an exceptional ring, broken inversion symmetry is shown to give rise to extrinsic (BCD) and intrinsic (BCP) nonlinear Hall behaviors unique to systems with extensive exceptional singularities. In particular, when the non-Hermiticity is increased while keeping the ring radius fixed, the BCD response exhibits a power-law increase, while the BCP response correspondingly decreases. Our work sheds light on how non-Hermiticity can qualitatively control the extent and nature of higher harmonic generation in solids.</description>

      <title>Giant Heat Flux Effect in Non-Chiral Transmission Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of heat transport in non-chiral transmission lines (TLs) of quantum Hall edge channels coupled to Ohmic contacts (OCs) that accounts for a dynamical accumulation of charge in the reservoirs. As a consequence, heat transport is driven by charge fluctuations in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. This framework challenges conventional paradigms by revealing a giant heat flux effect-a significant amplification in heat transport arising from non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation relations. Through a Langevin-based approach, we derive the effective noise power in the chiral currents, which underlies this enhanced heat flux. Our findings predict clear experimental signatures unique to non-chiral TLs, as well as provide insights into finite-frequency effects, showing crossovers to more conventional diffusive behavior. This work offers a perspective on feedback mechanisms in quasi-1D heat transport with implications for dissipation control in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Approaching ideal visibility in singlet-triplet qubit operations using energy-selective tunneling-based Hamiltonian estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report energy selective tunneling readout-based Hamiltonian parameter estimation of a two-electron spin qubit in a GaAs quantum dot array. Optimization of readout fidelity enables a single-shot measurement time of 16 on average, with adaptive initialization and efficient qubit frequency estimation based on real-time Bayesian inference. For qubit operation in a frequency heralded mode, we observe a 40-fold increase in coherence time without resorting to dynamic nuclear polarization. We also demonstrate active frequency feedback with quantum oscillation visibility, single-shot measurement fidelity, and state initialization fidelity up to 97.7%, 99%, and over 99.7%, respectively. By pushing the sensitivity of the energy selective tunneling-based spin to charge conversion to the limit, the technique is useful for advanced quantum control protocols such as error mitigation schemes, where fast qubit parameter calibration with a large signal-to-noise ratio is crucial.</description>

      <title>Exotic synchronization in continuous time crystals outside the symmetric subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring continuous time crystals (CTCs) within the symmetric subspace of spin systems has been a subject of intensive research in recent times. Thus far, the stability of the time-crystal phase outside the symmetric subspace in such spin systems has gone largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the effect of including the asymmetric subspaces on the dynamics of CTCs in a driven dissipative spin model. This results in multistability, and the dynamics becomes dependent on the initial state. Remarkably, this multistability leads to exotic synchronization regimes such as chimera states and cluster synchronization in an ensemble of coupled identical CTCs. Interestingly, it leads to other nonlinear phenomena such as oscillation death and signature of chaos.</description>

      <title>Revelation of new magnetic domain wall category and spin-density-wave boundary state in itinerant magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are typically characterized by the reorientation of local moments. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic boundaries of spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we observed that the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation, which generated a double-Q SDW state accompanied by a second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. The screw dislocations induced "half" vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. We find the spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls; while for the first time, we observed intriguing SDW in-gap states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new category of magnetic domain wall - the "interference wall", with a mechanism rooted in itinerant nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Theory of Tunneling Spectroscopy in Unconventional $p$-wave Magnet-Superconductor Hybrid Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional unconventional $p$-wave magnet (UPM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing symmetries. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are insensitive against varying the magnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic change as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a UPM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing symmetries of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of UPM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum machines using $\rm{Cu}_{3}$-like compounds modeled by Heisenberg antiferromagnetic in a triangular ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theoretical study of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{X}$ $(\rm{X=As, Sb})$, characterized by a slightly distorted equilateral triangle configuration is presented. Using the Heisenberg model with exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, g-factors, and an external magnetic field, three quantum machines are investigated using this system as the working substance, assuming reversible processes. For ${\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{X}}$ he magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is significant at low temperatures (around 1K) under a perpendicular magnetic field ($\sim5$T). Although only the $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{As}$ compound is considered, since the $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{Sb}$ compound behaves quite similarly. How MCE influences the Carnot machine, which operates as a heat engine or refrigerator when varying the external magnetic field is analyzed. In contrast, the Otto and Stirling machines can operate as heat engines, refrigerators, heaters, or thermal accelerators, depending on the magnetic field intensity. The results indicate that enhanced MCE broadens the operating regions for these machines, with the Otto and Stirling machines primarily functioning as refrigerators and accelerators. The corresponding thermal efficiencies are also discussed for all operating modes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction in nanofluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length scales all the way down to 1 nm. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Synthetic gain for electron-beam spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-beam microscopy and spectroscopy featuring atomic-scale spatial resolution have become essential tools used daily in almost all branches of nanoscale science and technology. As a natural supercontinuum source of light, free electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and intra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations, intertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present significant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst complex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic complex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron--light interaction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed coherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer virtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral features, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence measurements on multi-layer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and film-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can retrieve resonance excitation completely buried underneath the zero-loss peak, substantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve entangled multiple-photon-electron events in their quantum interaction. Our findings indicate the versatile utility of complex frequency waves in various electron-beam spectroscopy and their promising diagnostic capabilities in free-electron quantum optics.</description>
