      <title>Spectral Coarse-Graining and Rescaling for Preserving Structural and Dynamical Properties in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a graph renormalization procedure based on the coarse-grained Laplacian, which generates reduced-complexity representations for characteristic scales identified through the spectral gap. This method retains both diffusion probabilities and large-scale topological structures, while reducing redundant information, facilitating the analysis of large graphs by decreasing the number of vertices. Applied to graphs derived from EEG recordings of human brain activity, our approach reveals macroscopic properties emerging from neuronal interactions, such as collective behavior in the form of coordinated neuronal activity. Additionally, it shows dynamic reorganization of brain activity across scales, with more generalized patterns during rest and more specialized and scale-invariant activity in the occipital lobe during attention-focused tasks.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust One-Bit Diffraction Tomography and Optimal Dose Fractionation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a noise-robust framework for 1-bit diffraction tomography, a novel imaging approach that relies on intensity-only binary measurements obtained through coded apertures. The proposed reconstruction scheme leverages random matrix theory and iterative algorithms, including power iteration and shifted inverse power iteration, to effectively recover 3D object structures under high-noise conditions. Theoretical analysis highlights the de-noising capabilities of the 1-bit scheme, with numerical experiments validating its robustness across varying noise levels, projection densities, and mask configurations.
  A key contribution is the investigation of dose fractionation, revealing optimal performance at a signal-to-noise ratio near 1, independent of the total dose. This finding addresses the dose-damage trade-off critical in radiation-sensitive imaging applications, such as biological microscopy. The study also explores the spectral properties of the reconstruction process, providing insights into algorithmic convergence and the interplay between eigenvector correlations and spectral gaps.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation (emulator) used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (&lt;=8% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, making it particularly relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Designing a Dataset for Convolutional Neural Networks to Predict Space Groups Consistent with Extinction Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a dataset of one-dimensional powder diffraction patterns was designed with new strategy to train Convolutional Neural Networks for predicting space groups. The diffraction pattern was calculated based on lattice parameters and Extinction Laws, instead of the traditional approach of generating it from a crystallographic database. This paper demonstrates that the new strategy is more effective than the conventional method. As a result, the model trained on the cubic and tetragonal training set from the newly designed dataset achieves prediction accuracy that matches the theoretical maximums calculated based on Extinction Laws. These results demonstrate that machine learning-based prediction can be both physically reasonable and reliable. Additionally, the model trained on our newly designed dataset shows excellent generalization capability, much better than the one trained on a traditionally designed dataset.</description>
