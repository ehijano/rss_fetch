      <title>AI-Augmented Visible Light Communication: A Framework for Noise Mitigation and Secure Data Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a proposed AI Deep Learning model that addresses common challenges encountered in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. In this work, we run a Python simulation that models a basic VLC system primarily affected by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is then trained to equalize the noisy signal received and improve signal integrity. The system evaluates and compares the Bit Error Rate (BER) before and after equalization to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. This paper starts by introducing the concept of visible light communication, then it dives deep into some details about the process of VLC and the challenges it faces, shortly after we propose our project which helps overcome these challenges. We finally conclude with a lead for future work, highlighting the areas that are most suitable for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity Function Analysis of AFDM Signals for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-based waveform with high flexibility and resilience, making it well-suited for next-generation wireless networks, particularly in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the ambiguity functions (AFs) of AFDM signals, which fundamentally characterize their range and velocity estimation capabilities in both monostatic and bistatic settings. Specifically, we first derive the auto-ambiguity function (AAF) of an AFDM chirp subcarrier, revealing its "spike-like" local property and "periodic-like" global property along the rotated delay and Doppler dimensions. This structure naturally forms a parallelogram for each localized pulse of the AAF of the AFDM chirp subcarrier, enabling unambiguous target sensing. Then, we study the cross-ambiguity function (CAF) between two different AFDM chirp subcarriers, which exhibits the same local and global properties as the AAF but with an additional shift along the Doppler dimension. We then extend our analysis to the AF of various typical AFDM frames, considering both deterministic pilot and random data symbols. In particular, we demonstrate that inserting guard symbols in AFDM facilitates interference-free sensing. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, highlighting AFDM's strong potential for ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>Unobtrusive Reflectance Photoplethysmography for Detecting and Severity Grading of Sleep Apnea via Oxygen Desaturation Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep apnea is a common chronic sleep-related disorder which is known to be a comorbidity for cerebro- and cardio-vascular disease. Diagnosis of sleep apnea usually requires an overnight polysomnography at the sleep laboratory. In this paper, we used a wearable device which measures reflectance photoplethysmography (PPG) at the wrist and upper arm to estimate continuous SpO2 levels during sleep and subsequently derive an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) for each patient. On a cohort of 170 patients undergoing sleep apnea screening, we evaluated whether this ODI value could represent a surrogate marker for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for the diagnosis and severity assessment of sleep apnea. As the ODI was simultaneously obtained at the fingertip, upper arm and wrist, we compared ODI diagnostic performance depending on the measurement location. We then further evaluated the accuracy of ODI as a direct predictor for moderate and severe sleep apnea as defined by established AHI thresholds. We found that ODI values obtained at the upper arm were good predictors for moderate or severe sleep apnea, with 86% accuracy, 96% sensitivity and 70% specificity, whereas ODI values obtained at the wrist were less reliable as a diagnostic tool.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Cognition in ISAR Processing for Spectral Compatibility Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes the concept of a cognitive inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) ensuring spectral compatibility in crowded electromagnetic environments. In such a context, the proposed approach alternates between environmental perception, recognizing possible emitters in its frequency range, and an action stage, synthesizing and transmitting a tailored radar waveform to achieve the desired imaging task while guaranteeing spectral coexistence with overlaid emitters. The perception is carried out by a spectrum sensing module providing the true relevant spectral parameters of the sources in the environment. The action stage employs a tailored signal design process, synthesizing a radar waveform with bespoke spectral notches, enabling ISAR imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth without interfering with the other radio frequency (RF) sources. A key enabling requirement for the proposed application is the capability to successfully recover possible missing data in the frequency domain (induced by spectral notches) and in the slow-time dimension (enabling concurrent RF activities still in a cognitive fashion). This process is carried out by resorting to advanced methods based on either the compressed-sensing framework or a rank-minimization recovery strategy. The capabilities of the proposed system are assessed exploiting a dataset of drone measurements in the frequency band between 13 GHz and 15 GHz. Results highlight the effectiveness of the devised architecture to enable spectral compatibility while delivering high-quality ISAR images as well as additional RF activities.</description>

      <title>A Temporal Gaussian Noise Model for Equalization-enhanced Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equalization-enhanced Phase Noise causes burst-like distortions in high symbol-rate transmission systems. We propose a temporal Gaussian noise model that captures these distortions by introducing a time-varying distortion power. Validated through simulations and experiments, it enables accurate and simple performance prediction for high symbol-rate transmission systems.</description>

      <title>Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation with Peak Age of Information Violation Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent (student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher rewards, and greater stability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Symbol Digital AirComp via Modulation Design and Power Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider digital over-the-air computation (AirComp) and introduce a new multi-symbol modulation framework called sequential modulation for AirComp (SeMAC). Building upon ChannelComp, a general framework for designing modulation schemes to support arbitrary function computation over a multiple access channel (MAC), SeMAC maps each input value to a sequence of modulated symbols using distinct constellation diagrams across multiple time slots. This extension generalizes ChannelComp by enabling flexible modulation design across multiple transmissions, thereby enhancing reliability against channel noise. We formulate the modulation design as a non-convex optimization problem, apply matrix lifting to relax it into a semidefinite programming (SDP), and recover a feasible modulation solution by solving a low rank approximation. For scenarios where the modulation formats cannot be changed, we further develop a power adaptation scheme that adjusts amplitude and phase of the modulated symbols while preserving the modulation structure. Numerical results show that SeMAC can achieve a reliable computation by reducing the computation error up to 18 dB compared to other existing methods, particularly for the product function.</description>

Abstract: Room impulse response estimation is essential for tasks like speech dereverberation, which improves automatic speech recognition. Most existing methods rely on either statistical signal processing or deep neural networks designed to replicate signal processing principles. However, combining statistical and physical modeling for RIR estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating both aspects through a theoretically grounded model. The RIR is decomposed into interpretable parameters: white Gaussian noise filtered by a frequency-dependent exponential decay (e.g. modeling wall absorption) and an autoregressive filter (e.g. modeling microphone response). A variational free-energy cost function enables practical parameter estimation. As a proof of concept, we show that given dry and reverberant speech signals, the proposed method outperforms classical deconvolution in noisy environments, as validated by objective metrics.</description>

      <title>A Review on Deep Learning Autoencoder in the Design of Next-Generation Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional mathematical models used in designing next-generation communication systems often fall short due to inherent simplifications, narrow scope, and computational limitations. In recent years, the incorporation of deep learning (DL) methodologies into communication systems has made significant progress in system design and performance optimisation. Autoencoders (AEs) have become essential, enabling end-to-end learning that allows for the combined optimisation of transmitters and receivers. Consequently, AEs offer a data-driven methodology capable of bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexities. The paper presents a comprehensive survey of the application of AEs within communication systems, with a particular focus on their architectures, associated challenges, and future directions. We examine 120 recent studies across wireless, optical, semantic, and quantum communication fields, categorising them according to transceiver design, channel modelling, digital signal processing, and computational complexity. This paper further examines the challenges encountered in the implementation of AEs, including the need for extensive training data, the risk of overfitting, and the requirement for differentiable channel models. Through data-driven approaches, AEs provide robust solutions for end-to-end system optimisation, surpassing traditional mathematical models confined by simplifying assumptions. This paper also summarises the computational complexity associated with AE-based systems by conducting an in-depth analysis employing the metric of floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). This analysis encompasses the evaluation of matrix multiplications, bias additions, and activation functions. This survey aims to establish a roadmap for future research, emphasising the transformative potential of AEs in the formulation of next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Physically Large Apertures for Wireless Power Transfer: Performance and Regulatory Aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising service for the Internet of Things, providing a cost-effective and sustainable solution to deploy so-called energy-neutral devices on a massive scale. The power received at the device side from a conventional transmit antenna with a physically small aperture decays rapidly with the distance. New opportunities arise from the transition from conventional far-field beamforming to near-field beam focusing. We argue that a physically large aperture, i.e., large with respect to the distance to the receiver, enables a power budget that remains practically independent of distance. Distance-dependent array gain patterns allow focusing the power density maximum precisely at the device location, while reducing the power density near the infrastructure. Physical aperture size is a key resource in enabling efficient yet regulatory-compliant WPT. We use real-world measurements to demonstrate that a regulatory-compliant system operating at sub-10GHz frequencies can increase the power received at the device into the milliwatt range. Our empirical demonstration shows that power-optimal near-field beam focusing inherently exploits multipath propagation, yielding both increased WPT efficiency and improved human exposure safety.</description>

      <title>A Novel Shape-Aware Topological Representation for GPR Data with DNN Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks. However, existing ISAC systems are based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which inevitably incur a loss in performance when balancing the trade-off between sensing and communication. Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to enhance ISAC performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. Nevertheless, exploiting more spatial channel variations requires larger antenna moving regions, which may invalidate the conventional far-field assumption for channels between transceivers. Therefore, this paper utilizes the MA to enhance sensing and communication capabilities in near-field ISAC systems, where a full-duplex base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit and receive MAs movable in large-size regions to simultaneously sense multiple targets and serve multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users for communication. We aim to maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication rates (WSR) by jointly designing the transmit beamformers, sensing signal covariance matrices, receive beamformers, and MA positions at the BS, as well as the UL power allocation. The resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve. Thus, we propose an efficient two-layer random position (RP) algorithm to tackle it. In addition, to reduce movement delay and cost, we design an antenna position matching (APM) algorithm based on the greedy strategy to minimize the total MA movement distance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the substantial performance improvement achieved by deploying MAs in near-field ISAC systems. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the proposed APM algorithm in reducing the antenna movement distance, which is helpful for energy saving and time overhead reduction for MA-aided near-field ISAC systems with large moving regions.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>QubitLens: An Interactive Learning Tool for Quantum State Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum computing, involving the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state from measurement outcomes. Although essential, it is typically introduced at the graduate level due to its reliance on advanced concepts such as the density matrix formalism, tensor product structures, and partial trace operations. This complexity often creates a barrier for students and early learners. In this work, we introduce QubitLens, an interactive visualization tool designed to make quantum state tomography more accessible and intuitive. QubitLens leverages maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), a classical statistical method, to estimate pure quantum states from projective measurement outcomes in the X, Y, and Z bases. The tool emphasizes conceptual clarity through visual representations, including Bloch sphere plots of true and reconstructed qubit states, bar charts comparing parameter estimates, and fidelity gauges that quantify reconstruction accuracy. QubitLens offers a hands-on approach to learning quantum tomography without requiring deep prior knowledge of density matrices or optimization theory. The tool supports both single- and multi-qubit systems and is intended to bridge the gap between theory and practice in quantum computing education.</description>

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to enrich the comprehension of iterative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstructions, including compressed sensing (CS) and iterative deep learning (DL) reconstructions, by describing them in the general framework of finite-dimensional inner-product spaces. In particular, we show that image-space preconditioning (ISP) and data-space preconditioning (DSP) can be formulated as non-conventional inner-products. The main gain of our reformulation is an embedding of ISP in the variational formulation of the MRI reconstruction problem (in an algorithm-independent way) which allows in principle to naturally and systematically propagate ISP in all iterative reconstructions, including many iterative DL and CS reconstructions where preconditioning is lacking. The way in which we apply linear algebraic tools to MRI reconstructions as presented in this article is a novelty.
  A secondary aim of our article is to offer a certain didactic material to scientists who are new in the field of MRI reconstruction. Since we explore here some mathematical concepts of reconstruction, we take that opportunity to recall some principles that may be understood for experts, but which may be hard to find in the literature for beginners. In fact, the description of many mathematical tools of MRI reconstruction is fragmented in the literature or sometimes missing because considered as a general knowledge. Further, some of those concepts can be found in mathematic manuals, but not in a form that is oriented toward MRI. For example, we think of the conjugate gradient descent, the notion of derivative with respect to non-conventional inner products, or simply the notion of adjoint. The authors believe therefore that it is beneficial for their field of research to dedicate some space to such a didactic material.</description>
