      <title>Right Place, Right Time: Market Simulation-based RL for Execution Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Execution algorithms are vital to modern trading, they enable market participants to execute large orders while minimising market impact and transaction costs. As these algorithms grow more sophisticated, optimising them becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for discovering optimal execution strategies, evaluated within a reactive agent-based market simulator. This simulator creates reactive order flow and allows us to decompose slippage into its constituent components: market impact and execution risk. We assess the RL agent's performance using the efficient frontier based on work by Almgren and Chriss, measuring its ability to balance risk and cost. Results show that the RL-derived strategies consistently outperform baselines and operate near the efficient frontier, demonstrating a strong ability to optimise for risk and impact. These findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning as a powerful tool in the trader's toolkit.</description>

      <title>Causal and Predictive Modeling of Short-Horizon Market Risk and Systematic Alpha Generation Using Hybrid Machine Learning Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic trading framework that forecasts short-horizon market risk, identifies its underlying drivers, and generates alpha using a hybrid machine learning ensemble built to trade on the resulting signal. The framework integrates neural networks with tree-based voting models to predict five-day drawdowns in the S&amp;P 500 ETF, leveraging a cross-asset feature set spanning equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, commodities, and volatility markets. Interpretable feature attribution methods reveal the key macroeconomic and microstructural factors that differentiate high-risk (crash) from benign (non-crash) weekly regimes. Empirical results show a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and an annualized CAPM alpha of +0.28, with a market beta of 0.51, indicating that the model delivers substantial systematic alpha with limited directional exposure during the 2005--2025 backtest period. Overall, the findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid ensemble architectures in capturing nonlinear risk dynamics and identifying interpretable, potentially causal drivers, providing a robust blueprint for machine learning-driven alpha generation in systematic trading.</description>

      <title>TABL-ABM: A Hybrid Framework for Synthetic LOB Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent application of deep learning models to financial trading has heightened the need for high fidelity financial time series data. This synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model. This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to help account for tail events.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multilevel Splitting: First Application to Rare-Event Derivative Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the computational burden of pricing binary options in rare-event settings and introduces an adaptation of the adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) method for financial derivatives. Standard Monte Carlo is inefficient for deep out of the money binaries due to discontinuous payoffs and low exercise probabilities, requiring very large samples for accurate estimates. An AMS scheme is developed for binary options under Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics, reformulating the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events. Numerical experiments compare the method to Monte Carlo and to other techniques such as antithetic variables and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) across four contracts: European digital calls and puts, and Asian digital calls and puts. Results show up to a 200-fold computational gain for deep out-of-the-money cases while preserving unbiasedness. No evidence is found of prior applications of AMS to financial derivatives. The approach improves pricing efficiency for rare-event contracts such as parametric insurance and catastrophe linked securities. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided, supporting multiple discretizations and importance functions.</description>

      <title>Temporal Relational Reasoning of Large Language Models for Detecting Stock Portfolio Crashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stock portfolios are often exposed to rare consequential events (e.g., 2007 global financial crisis, 2020 COVID-19 stock market crash), as they do not have enough historical information to learn from. Large Language Models (LLMs) now present a possible tool to tackle this problem, as they can generalize across their large corpus of training data and perform zero-shot reasoning on new events, allowing them to detect possible portfolio crash events without requiring specific training data. However, detecting portfolio crashes is a complex problem that requires more than reasoning abilities. Investors need to dynamically process the impact of each new piece of information found in news articles, analyze the relational network of impacts across different events and portfolio stocks, as well as understand the temporal context between impacts across time-steps, in order to obtain the aggregated impact on the target portfolio. In this work, we propose an algorithmic framework named Temporal Relational Reasoning (TRR). It seeks to emulate the spectrum of human cognitive capabilities used for complex problem-solving, which include brainstorming, memory, attention and reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we show that TRR is able to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on detecting stock portfolio crashes, and demonstrate how each of the proposed components help to contribute to its performance through an ablation study. Additionally, we further explore the possible applications of TRR by extending it to other related complex problems, such as the detection of possible global crisis events in Macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD) for CVaR-Constrained Portfolio Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios combined with a convex CVaR allocator improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We present MARCD, a generative-to-decision framework with: (i) a Gaussian HMM to infer latent regimes; (ii) a diffusion generator that produces regime-conditioned scenarios; (iii) signal extraction via blended, shrunk moments; and (iv) a governed CVaR epigraph quadratic program. Contributions: Within the Scenario stage we introduce a tail-weighted diffusion objective that up-weights low-quantile outcomes relevant for drawdowns and a regime-expert (MoE) denoiser whose gate increases with crisis posteriors; both are evaluated end-to-end through the allocator. Under strict walk-forward on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD exhibits stronger scenario calibration and materially smaller drawdowns: MaxDD 9.3% versus 14.1% for BL (a 34% reduction) over 2020-2025 out-of-sample. The framework provides an auditable pipeline with explicit budget, box, and turnover constraints, demonstrating the value of decision-aware generative modeling in finance.</description>
