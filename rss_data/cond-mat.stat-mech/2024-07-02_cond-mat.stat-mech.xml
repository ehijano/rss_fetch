      <title>Fickian Insights Using Probability Theory as Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Clearing Up Mysteries -- The Original Goal (Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods: Cambridge, England, 1988 Springer, pp. 1-27) Jaynes derived Fick's Law for a dilute binary solution from Bayes' Theorem by considering, probabilistically, the motion of dilute solute molecules. Modifying Jaynes' prior, changing the frame of reference, and allowing for multicomponent systems, one can follow Jaynes' logic to arrive at several expressions for the diffusion coefficient that are widely used in application to solvent-polymer systems. These results, however, do not generally satisfy required conditions over the full concentration range. This limitation is resolved by considering the joint motion of all components in the solution with the inclusion of known physical constraints. Doing so, one arrives at a new set of constitutive equations for binary and multicomponent diffusion that include Darken's form as a limit and provide means to characterize inter-species correlations, removing the need for the ad hoc modifications of the thermodynamic term or substitution of bulk compositions with local compositions that have been proposed in the literature. In binary systems, the Bayesian expression for the mutual diffusion coefficient provides explicit limits on non-ideal mutual diffusion behavior, given component self-diffusion coefficients, that can be attributed to inter-species correlation versus stronger intra- and inter-species clustering. Applications of the model to published data for a set of binary systems are presented, along with pointers to further directions for research.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Molecular Dynamics and Method of Moments in Two-Dimensional Concentric Circular Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we undertake an examination of a classical plasma deployed on two finite co-planar surfaces: a circular region $\Omega_{in}$ into an annular region $\Omega_{out}$ with a gap in between. It is studied both from the point of view of statistical mechanics and the electrostatics of continua media. We employ a dual perspective: the first one is by using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to find the system's positional correlation functions and velocity distributions. That by modeling the system as a classical two-dimensional Coulomb plasma of point-like charged particles $q_1$ and $q_2$ on the layers $\Omega_{in}$ and $\Omega_{out}$ respectively with no background density. The second one corresponds to a finite surface electrode composed of planar metallic layers displayed on the regions $\Omega_{in}$, $\Omega_{out}$ at constant voltages $V_{in}$, $V_{out}$ considering axial symmetry. The surface charge density is calculated by the Method of Moments (MoM) under the electrostatic approximation. Point-like and differential charges elements interact via a $1/r$ - electric potential in both cases. The thermodynamic averages of the number density, and electric potential due to the plasma depend on the coupling and the charge ratio $\xi=q_1/q_2$ once the geometry of the layers is fixed. On the other hand, the fields due to the SE depend on the layer's geometry and their voltage. In the document, is defined a protocol to properly compare the systems. We show that there are values of the coupling parameter, where the thermodynamic averages computed via MD agree with the results of MoM for attractive $\xi=-1$ and repulsive layers $\xi=1$.
  Keywords: molecular dynamics, method of moments, Coulomb systems, long-range interaction.</description>

      <title>Short-time large deviation of constrained random acceleration process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By optimal fluctuation method, we study short-time distribution $P(\mathcal{A}=A)$ of the functionals, $\mathcal{A}=\int_{0}^{t_f} x^n(t) dt$, along constrained trajectories of random acceleration process for a given time duration $t_f$, where $n$ is a positive integer. We consider two types of constraints: one is called the total constraint, where the initial position and velocity and the final position and velocity are both fixed, and the other is called the partial constraint, where the initial position and velocity, the final position are fixed, and letting the final velocity be free. Via the variation of constrained action functionals, the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations are analytically solved for $n=1$ and 2, and the optimal path, i.e., the most probable realization of the random acceleration process $x(t)$, conditioned on specified $A$ and $n$, are correspondingly obtained. For $n \geq 3$, a numerical scheme is proposed to find the optimal path. We show that, for $n=1$, $P(A)$ is a Gaussian distribution with the variance proportional to $Dt_f^5$ ($D$ is the particle velocity diffusion constant). For $n \geq 2$, $P(A)$ exhibits the non-Gaussian feature. In the small-$A$ limit, $P(A)$ show a essential singularity, $-\ln P(A) \sim A^{-3}$, and the optimal path localizes around the initial state over a long-time window, and then escapes to the final position sharply at a late time. For $A$ much larger than its typical value, there are multiple optimal paths with the same $A$ but with different actions (or probability densities). Among these degenerate paths, one with the minimum action is dominant, and the others are exponentially unlikely. All the theoretical results are validated by simulating the effective Langevin equations governing the constrained random acceleration process.</description>

      <title>Bethe $M$-layer construction for the percolation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-optimization theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fluctuation theorem relating the work to its optimal average work is presented. The function mediating the relation is increasing and convex, and depends on the switching time $\tau$, driving strength $\delta\lambda/\lambda_0$, and protocol $g(t)$. The result is corroborated by an example of an overdamped white noise Brownian motion subjected to a moving laser harmonic trap. Observing also that the fluctuation-optimization theorem is an Euler-Lagrange equation, I conclude that the function minimizing $\langle h(-\beta W)\rangle$ obeys the relation proposed. The optimal work can now be calculated with numerical methods without knowing the optimal protocol, using only a work distribution of an arbitrary protocol.</description>

      <title>The most uniform distribution of points on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to distribute a set of points uniformly on a spherical surface is a very old problem that still lacks a definite answer. In this work, we introduce a physical measure of uniformity based on the distribution of distances between points, as an alternative to commonly adopted measures based on interaction potentials. We then use this new measure of uniformity to characterize several algorithms available in the literature. We also study the effect of optimizing the position of the points through the minimization of different interaction potentials via a gradient descent procedure. In this way, we can classify different algorithms and interaction potentials to find the one that generates the most uniform distribution of points on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for 1-matric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Probing Random-Bond Disorder Effects on Ferromagnetic Skyrmion Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examined the impact of disorder in a ferromagnetic skyrmion lattice by introducing random-bond disorder based on two different models for both exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions: Model I, where both interactions present the same disorder distribution and thus the same local distortion, and Model II, where both interactions have different disorder distributions. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we explored the effect of bond disorder on the emergent phases induced by an external magnetic field at different temperatures, varying the disorder amplitude across a range from weak (10%) to strong (200%) regimes. Our study shows that for both models, moderate disorder at low magnetic fields breaks the helical order and induces a topologically non-trivial bimeron phase. We also found that the skyrmion lattice phase loses its periodicity, but surprisingly, the resulting phases retain topological characteristics up to high disorder amplitudes. Moreover, a significant difference between both disorder models is found at large magnetic fields: while in the first model, the high-field skyrmion phase is suppressed by disorder, in the second model, this phase is enhanced and expanded in temperature and magnetic field. Furthermore, for the second model, intermediate values of disorder induce a diluted skyrmion phase and chiral textures emerging from the ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures. Our results are relevant for layered magnets and provide valuable insights into the intricate behavior of skyrmion systems under varying disorder conditions.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros in Quantum Phase Transition: An Entanglement Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Yang-Lee theory to quantum phase transitions to show how singularity enters the phase transition points in one-dimensional many-body systems. We primarily focus on the distribution of Yang-Lee zeros and its associated Yang-Lee edge singularity of two prototypical models: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the XXZ spin chain. By taking the zero-temperature limit, we show how the Yang-Lee zeros approach the quantum phase transition points on the complex plane of parameters. To characterize the edge singularity induced by Yang-Lee zeros in quantum phase transition, we introduce the entanglement entropy of the ground state to show the edges of Yang-Lee zeros lead to the entanglement transition. We further show our results are also applicable to the general non-interacting parity-time-symmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least important nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. Furthermore, we introduce the core-periphery score to properly separate the core and periphery with our decomposition scheme. By extending the method combined with the network community structure, we successfully detect multiple core-periphery structures by decomposition inside each community. Moreover, the application of our decomposition to supernode networks defined from the communities reveals the intricate relation between the two representative mesoscale structures.</description>

      <title>Dissipative chaos and steady state of open Tavis-Cummings dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled atom-photon system described by the Tavis-Cummings dimer (two coupled cavities) in the presence of photon loss and atomic pumping, to investigate the quantum signature of dissipative chaos. The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

Abstract: The description of thermodynamic phase transitions in terms of percolation transitions of suitably defined clusters has a long tradition and boasts a number of important successes, the most prominent ones being in ferromagnetic lattice models. Spin glasses and other frustrated systems are not among them as the clusters of aligned spins usually considered in this context start to percolate in the disordered phase and hence fail to indicate the onset of ordering. In this mini-review we provide an overview of the state of the art in this field, including recent advances, and outline the main open questions in the area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. Based on the equivalence with the four-derivative action I argue that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions is described by the (4,3) minimal model analogously to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>

      <title>Limiting free energy per particle for Ising Model by approximating its functional integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10349v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been a lot of methods aimed at studying the limiting free energy per particle (LFEPP) for 3D Ising model in absence of an external magnetic field. These methods are elegant, but most of them are complicated and often require specialized knowledge and special skills. Here we approximate the LFEPP for Ising model from its corresponding functional integral. The resulting Ising LFEPP, which includes an integral of a special function, is exact asymptotically. For 1D and 2D Ising model, this LFEPPs in two limiting cases are consistent or formally consistent with those well-known, respectively. Based on these consistences, we infer the LFEPPs for 3D model in these special cases. Additionally, with this LFEPP, we derive a further approximate one for 3D Ising model, from which we infer the critical temperature $z_c\approx 0.21\sim 0.22$. Furthermore, we suggest similar LFEPPs for 1D-3D Ising models with an external magnetic field, although they are too complicated.</description>

Abstract: We provide a simple algorithm for constructing Hamiltonian graph cycles (visiting every vertex exactly once) on a set of arbitrarily large finite subgraphs of aperiodic two-dimensional Ammann-Beenker (AB) tilings. Using this result, and the discrete scale symmetry of AB tilings, we find exact solutions to a range of other problems which lie in the complexity class NP-complete for general graphs. These include the equal-weight traveling salesperson problem, providing, for example, the most efficient route a scanning tunneling microscope tip could take to image the atoms of physical quasicrystals with AB symmetries; the longest path problem, whose solution demonstrates that collections of flexible molecules of any length can adsorb onto AB quasicrystal surfaces at density one, with possible applications to catalysis; and the three-coloring problem, giving ground states for the $q$-state Potts model ($q \ge 3$) of magnetic interactions defined on the planar dual to AB, which may provide useful models for protein folding.</description>

      <title>Absorbing State Phase Transition with Clifford Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of quantum fluctuations in modifying the critical behavior of non-equilibrium phase transitions is a fundamental but unsolved question. In this study, we examine the absorbing state phase transition of a 1D chain of qubits undergoing a contact process that involves both coherent and classical dynamics. We adopt a discrete-time quantum model with states that can be described in the stabilizer formalism, and therefore allows for an efficient simulation of large system sizes. The extracted critical exponents indicate that the absorbing state phase transition of this Clifford circuit model belongs to the directed percolation universality class. This suggests that the inclusion of quantum fluctuations does not necessarily alter the critical behavior of non-equilibrium phase transitions of purely classical systems. Finally, we extend our analysis to a non-Clifford circuit model, where a tentative scaling analysis in small systems reveals critical exponents that are also consistent with the directed percolation universality class.</description>

Abstract: We propose a loop optimization algorithm based on nuclear norm regularization for tensor network. The key ingredient of this scheme is to introduce a rank penalty term proposed in the context of data processing. Compared to standard variational periodic matrix product states method, this algorithm can circumvent the local minima related to short-ranged correlation in a simpler fashion. We demonstrate its performance when used as a part of the tensor network renormalization algorithms [S. Yang, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 110504 (2017)] for the critical 2D Ising model. The scale invariance of the renormalized tensors is attained with higher accuracy while the higher parts of the scaling dimension spectrum are obtained in a more stable fashion.</description>

Abstract: Alternative computing paradigms open the door to exploiting recent innovations in computational hardware to probe the fundamental thermodynamic limits of information processing. One such paradigm employs superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to execute classical computations. This, though, requires constructing sufficiently complex superconducting circuits that support a suite of useful information processing tasks and storage operations, as well as understanding these circuits' energetics. First-principle circuit design, though, leads to prohibitive algebraic complications when deriving the effective equations of motion -- complications that to date have precluded achieving these goals, let alone doing so efficiently. We circumvent these complications by (i) specializing our class of circuits and physical operating regimes, (ii) synthesizing existing derivation techniques to suit these specializations, and (iii) implementing solution-finding optimizations which facilitate physically interpreting circuit degrees of freedom that respect physically-grounded constraints. This leads to efficient, practical circuit prototyping and access to scalable circuit architectures. The analytical efficiency is demonstrated by reproducing the potential energy landscape generated by the quantum flux parametron (QFP). We then show how inductively coupling two QFPs produces a device that is capable of executing 2-bit computations via its composite potential energy landscape. More generally, the synthesis methods detailed here provide a basis for constructing universal logic gates and investigating their thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics in $d$ spatial dimensions of a Fermi gas subject to binary annihilation reactions $A+A \to \emptyset$. These systems display collective nonequilibrium long-time behavior, which is signalled by an algebraic decay of the particle density. Building on the Keldysh formalism, we devise a field theoretical approach for the reaction-limited regime, where annihilation reactions are scarce. By means of a perturbative expansion of the dissipative interaction, we derive a description in terms of a large-scale universal kinetic equation. Our approach shows how the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble assumption, which is often employed for treating low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, emerges from systematic diagrammatics. It also allows to exactly compute -- for arbitrary spatial dimension -- the decay exponent of the particle density. The latter is based on the large-scale description of the quantum dynamics and it differs from the mean-field prediction even in dimension larger than one. We moreover consider spatially inhomogeneous setups involving an external potential. In confined systems the density decay is accelerated towards the mean-field algebraic behavior, while for deconfined scenarios the power-law decay is replaced by a slower non-algebraic decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a toy model for the study of monitored dynamics in a many-body quantum systems. We study the stochastic Schrodinger equation resulting from the continuous monitoring with a rate $\Gamma$ of a random hermitian operator chosen at every time from the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Due to invariance by unitary transformations, the dynamics of the eigenvalues $\{\lambda_\alpha\}_{\alpha=1}^n$ of the density matrix can be decoupled from that of the eigenvectors. Thus, stochastic equations are derived that exactly describe the dynamics of $\lambda$'s. We consider two regimes: in the presence of an extra dephasing term, which can be generated by imperfect quantum measurements, the density matrix has a stationary distribution, and we show that in the limit of large sizes the distribution of $\lambda$'s is described by an inverse Marchenko Pastur distribution. In the case of perfect measurements instead, purification eventually occurs and we focus on finite-time dynamics. In this case, remarkably, we find an exact solution for the joint probability distribution of $\lambda$'s at each time $t$ and for each size $n$. Two relevant regimes emerge: at small times $t\Gamma= O(1)$, the spectrum is in a Coulomb gas regime, with a well-defined continuous spectral distribution in the limit of $n\to\infty$. In that case, all moments of the density matrix become self-averaging and it is possible to characterize the entanglement spectrum exactly. In the limit of large times $t \Gamma = O(n)$ one enters instead a regime in which the eigenvalues are exponentially separated $\log(\lambda_\alpha/\lambda_\beta) = O(\Gamma t/n)$, but fluctuations $\sim O(\sqrt{\Gamma t/n})$ play an essential role. We are still able to characterize the asymptotic behaviors of entanglement entropy in this regime.</description>

      <title>Markov generators as non-hermitian supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonians: spectral properties via bi-orthogonal basis and Singular Value Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuity equations associated to continuous-time Markov processes can be considered as Euclidean Schr\"odinger equations, where the non-hermitian quantum Hamiltonian $\bold{H}={\bold{div}}{\bold J}$ is naturally factorized into the product of the divergence operator ${\bold {div}}$ and the current operator ${\bold J}$. For non-equilibrium Markov jump processes in a space of $N$ configurations with $M$ links and $C=M-(N-1)\geq 1$ independent cycles, this factorization of the $N \times N$ Hamiltonian ${\bold H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ involves the incidence matrix ${\bold I}$ and the current matrix ${\bold J}$ of size $M \times N$, so that the supersymmetric partner ${\hat{\bold H}}= {\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ governing the dynamics of the currents living on the $M$ links is of size $M \times M$. To better understand the relations between the spectral decompositions of these two Hamiltonians $\bold{H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ and ${\hat {\bold H}} ={\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ with respect to their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors that characterize the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state and the steady currents, it is useful to analyze the properties of the Singular Value Decompositions of the two rectangular matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J} $ of size $M \times N$ and the interpretations in terms of discrete Helmholtz decompositions. This general framework concerning Markov jump processes can be adapted to non-equilibrium diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations in dimension $d$, where the number $N$ of configurations, the number $M$ of links and the number $C=M-(N-1)$ of independent cycles become infinite, while the two matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J}$ become first-order differential operators acting on scalar functions to produce vector fields.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Brownian particles under resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of an anisotropic particle subjected to different stochastic resetting schemes in two dimensions. The Brownian motion of shape-asymmetric particles in two dimensions results in anisotropic diffusion at short times, while the late-time transport is isotropic due to rotational diffusion. We show that the presence of orientational resetting promotes the anisotropy to late times. When the spatial and orientational degrees of freedom are reset, we find that a non-trivial spatial probability distribution emerges in the steady state that is determined by the initial orientation, particle asymmetry and the resetting rate. When only spatial degrees of freedom are reset while the orientational degree of freedom is allowed to evolve freely, the steady state is independent of the particle asymmetry. When only particle orientation is reset, the late-time probability density is given by a Gaussian with an effective diffusion tensor, including off-diagonal terms, determined by the resetting rate. Generally, the coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, when combined with stochastic resetting, gives rise to unique behaviour at late times not present in the case of symmetric particles. Considering recent developments in experimental implementations of resetting, our results can be useful for the control of asymmetric colloids, for example in self-assembly processes.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic properties and hysteresis loops for the hexagonal Ising nanowire (HIN) with a core-shell structure consisting of mixed spins with the core spin being spin-5/2 and the shell spins being spin-3/2 are studied. The Blume-Capel model is considered by using the mean-field approximation (MFA) based on the Gibbs--Bogoliubov inequality for free energy. The impact of different bilinear interaction parameters ($J_{cc}, J_{ss}, J_{cs}$) between the core, shell, and core and shell spins, respectively, including the crystal ($D_c, D_s$) and external magnetic fields ($h=h_c=h_s$) at the core and shell sites, are taken into consideration. In order to obtain phase diagrams on various planes, the thermal changes of the net, core, and shell magnetizations are investigated for various values of our system parameters. It is discovered that the model exhibits only second-order phase transitions when $h=0.0$ for $D$ greater or equal to zero, first- and second-order phase transitions for $h\neq0.0$ and compensation temperatures for all $h$.</description>

Abstract: The exactly solvable spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg distorted diamond chain in the presence of the external magnetic field is investigated for the case of antiferromagnetic Ising and ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg interactions. The influence of quantum fluctuations and the distortion on the ground state, magnetic and thermal properties of the model are studied in detail. In particular, it is established that the zero-temperature magnetization curve may involve intermediate plateaus just at zero and 1/3 of the saturation magnetization. It is demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the specific heat reveals up to four distinct peaks at zero magnetic field and up to five distinct peaks at a weak magnetic field. The physical origin of all observed additional peaks of the specific heat has been clarified on the grounds of dominating thermal excitations. We have shown that the quantum fluctuations give rise to an effective geometrical frustration in this chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Xi_n \subset \mathbb R^d$, $n\ge 1$, be a sequence of finite sets and consider a $\Xi_n$-valued, irreducible, reversible, continuous-time Markov chain $(X^{(n)}_t:t\ge 0)$. Denote by $\mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) $ the set of probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$ and by $I_n\colon \mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) \to [0,+\infty)$ the level two large deviations rate functional for $X^{(n)}_t$ as $t\to\infty$. We present a general method, based on tools used to prove the metastable behaviour of Markov chains, to derive a full expansion of $I_n$ expressing it as $I_n = I^{(0)} \,+\, \sum_{1\le p\le q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_n)\, I^{(p)}$, where $I^{(p)}\colon \mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ represent rate functionals independent of $n$ and $\theta^{(p)}_n$ sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_n \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_n / \theta^{(p+1)}_n \to 0$ for $1\le p&lt; q$. The speed $\theta^{(p)}_n$ corresponds to the time-scale at which the Markov chains $X^{(n)}_t$ exhibits a metastable behavior, and the $I^{(p-1)}$ zero-level sets to the metastable states. To illustrate the theory we apply the method to random walks in potential fields.</description>

Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the analysis of the fixed-density Ising lattice gas in the presence of a gravitational field. This is a seen as a particular instance of an Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field in the fixed magnetization ensemble. We first characterize the typical magnetization profiles in the regime in which the contribution of the magnetic field competes with the bulk energy term. We then discuss in more detail the particular case of a gravitational field and the arising interfacial phenomena. In particular, we identify the macroscopic profile and propose several conjectures concerning the interface appearing in the phase coexistence regime. The latter are supported by explicit computations in an effective model. Finally, we state some conjectures concerning equilibrium crystal shapes in the presence of a gravitational field, when the latter contributes to the energy only to surface order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical simulation of highly-entangling quantum dynamics is conjectured to be generically hard. Thus, recently discovered measurement-induced transitions between highly entangling and low-entanglement dynamics are phase transitions in classical simulability. Here, we study simulability transitions beyond entanglement: noting that some highly-entangling dynamics (e.g., integrable systems or Clifford circuits) are easy to classically simulate, thus requiring "magic"--a subtle form of quantum resource--to achieve computational hardness, we ask how the dynamics of magic competes with measurements. We study the resulting "dynamical magic transitions" focusing on random monitored Clifford circuits doped by T gates (injecting magic). We identify dynamical "stabilizer-purification"--the collapse of a superposition of stabilizer states by measurements--as the mechanism driving this transition. We find cases where transitions in magic and entanglement coincide, but also others with a magic and simulability transition in a highly (volume-law) entangled phase. In establishing our results, we use Pauli-based computation, a scheme distilling the quantum essence of the dynamics to a magic state register subject to mutually commuting measurements. We link stabilizer-purification to "magic fragmentation" wherein these measurements separate into disjoint, O(1)-weight blocks, and relate this to the spread of magic in the original circuit becoming arrested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase transitions have been found experimentally or by computer simulations in many compounds such as water, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, silica, and silicon. Limited valence model implemented via event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm provides a simple generic mechanism for the liquid-liquid phase transitions in all these diverse cases. Here, we introduce a variant of the limited valence model with a well defined Hamiltonian, i.e., a unique algorithm by which the potential energy of the system of particles can be computed solely from the coordinates of the particles and is thus equivalent to a complex multi-body potential. We present several examples of the model which can be used to reproduce liquid-liquid phase transition in systems with maximum valence $z=1$ (hydrogen), $z=2$ (sulfur) and $z=4$ (water), where $z$ is the maximum number of bonds an atom is allowed to have. For $z=1$, we find a set of parameters for which the system has a liquid-liquid and an isostructural solid--solid critical points. For $z=4$, we find a set of parameters for which the phase diagram resembles that of water with a wide region of negative thermal expansion coefficient (density anomaly) extending into the metastable region of negative pressures. The limited valence model can be modified to forbid not only too large valences but also too low valences. In the case of sulfur, we forbid the formation of monomers, thus restricting the valence $v$ of an atom to be within an interval $1=v_{\rm min}\leqslant v\leqslant v_{\rm max}\equiv z=2$.</description>

Abstract: Boundary effects play an interesting role in finite-size physical systems. In this work, we study the boundary-induced properties of 1+1-dimensional critical systems driven by inhomogeneous M\"obius-like quenches. We focus on the entanglement entropy in BCFTs with a large central charge and a sparse spectrum of low-dimensional operators. We find that the choice of boundary conditions leads to different scenarios of dynamical phase transitions. We also derive these results in a holographic description in terms of intersecting branes in AdS$_3$, and find a precise match.</description>

      <title>On some features of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO or UBQP) is concerned with
  maximizing/minimizing the quadratic form
  $H(J, \eta) = W \sum_{i,j} J_{i,j} \eta_{i} \eta_{j}$ with $J$ a matrix of coefficients,
  $\eta \in \{0, 1\}^N$ and $W$ a normalizing constant.
  In the statistical mechanics literature, QUBO is a lattice gas counterpart to the (generalized) Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass model.
  Finding the optima of $H$ is an NP-hard problem.
  Several problems in combinatorial optimization and data analysis can be mapped to QUBO in a straightforward manner.
  In the combinatorial optimization literature, random instances of QUBO are often used to test the effectiveness of heuristic algorithms.
  Here we consider QUBO with random independent coefficients and show that if
  the $J_{i,j}$'s have zero mean and finite variance then, after proper normalization,
  the minimum and
  maximum \emph{per particle} of $H$ do not depend on the details of the distribution
  of the couplings and are concentrated around their expected values.
  Further, with the help of numerical simulations, we study the
  minimum and maximum of the objective function and provide some insight
  into the structure of the minimizer and the maximizer of $H$.
  We argue that also this structure is rather robust.
  Our findings hold also in the diluted case where each of the $J_{i,j}$'s is allowed
  to be zero with probability going to $1$ as $N \to \infty$ in a suitable way.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics: fluctuations in fission reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic modeling for a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. We particularly focus on the distribution of the fission probability. We find that it approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom $\nu$ of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding. We also show that $\nu$ corresponds to the number of eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian whose energy is close to the excitation energy of the system and at the same time which have significant components on both sides of a fission barrier.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of chaotic relaxation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The established thermodynamic formalism of chaotic dynamics, valid at statistical equilibrium, is here generalized to systems out of equilibrium, that have yet to relax to a steady state. A relation between information, escape rate, and the phase-space average of an integrated observable (e.g. Lyapunov exponent, diffusion coefficient) is obtained for finite time. Most notably, the thermodynamic treatment may predict the phase-space profile of any finite-time integrated observable from the leading and subleading eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius/Koopman transfer operator. Examples of that equivalence are shown, and the theory is tested analytically on the Bernoulli map, while numerically on the perturbed cat map, the H\'enon map, and the Ikeda map, all paradigms of chaos.</description>

      <title>Controlled Erasure as a Building Block for Universal Thermodynamically-Robust Superconducting Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12153</link>

Abstract: Reducing the energy inefficiency of conventional CMOS-based computing devices -- which rely on logically irreversible gates to process information -- remains both a fundamental engineering challenge and a practical social challenge of increasing importance. We extend an alternative computing paradigm that manipulates microstate distributions to store information in the metastable minima determined by an effective potential energy landscape. These minima serve as mesoscopic memories that are manipulated by a dynamic landscape to perform information processing. Central to our results is the control erase (CE) protocol that controls the landscape's metastable minima to determine whether information is preserved or erased. Importantly, successive protocol executions can implement a NAND gate -- a logically-irreversible universal logic gate. We show how to practically implement this in a device created by two inductively-coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). We identify circuit parameter ranges that give rise to effective CEs and establish the device's robustness against logical errors. These SQUID-based logical devices are capable of operating above GHz frequencies and at the $k_\text{B} T$ energy scale. Due to this, optimized devices and associated protocols provide a universal-computation substrate that is both computationally fast and energy efficient.</description>

      <title>Phase boundaries promote chemical reactions through localized fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hypothesized functions of biomolecular condensates is to act as chemical reactors, where chemical reactions can be modulated, i.e. accelerated or slowed down, while substrate molecules enter and products exit from the condensate. Likewise, the components themselves that take part in the architectural integrity of condensates might be modified by active (energy consuming, non-equilibrium) processes, e.g. by ATPase chaperones or by kinases and phosphatases. In this work, we study how the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, such as in the case of liquid-liquid phase separation, affects active chemical reactions and results in the presence of directional flows of matter, which are one of the hallmarks of non-equilibirum processes. We establish the minimal conditions for the existence of such spatial currents, and we furthermore find that these fluxes are maximal at the condensate interface. These results propose that some condensates might be most efficient as chemical factories due to their interfaces rather than their volumes, and could suggest a possible biological reason for the the observed abundance of small non-fusing condensates inside the cell, thus maximizing their surface and the associated fluxes.</description>
