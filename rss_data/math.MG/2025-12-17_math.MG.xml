      <title>An improved lower bound to Erdos' problem concerning products of distances for fixed diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erdos, Herzog and Piranian asked whether, for $n$ points in the plane with fixed diameter (maximum distance between points), an arrangement of a regular $n$-gon maximizes their product of all pairs of distances. Recently, it was discovered that, for every even $n \geq 4$, a regular $n$-gon is not a maximizer. However, the discovered improvement turns out to be very small. Indeed, for a fixed diameter of $2$, let $\Delta$ be the square of the product of all pairs of distances (the "square" is here due to connections with polynomial discriminants). Then, for a regular $n$-gon, $\Delta = n^n$ for even $n$. The discovered arrangements have proven $\Delta = (1+o(1))n^n$ thus far, and it was not known whether one can have $\Delta \geq C n^n$ for some $C &gt; 1$ and all sufficiently large even $n$. In this note, we show that indeed $\liminf_{n\to\infty} \Delta_{\max}/n^n &gt; 1.037$ for even $n$ which settles this conjecture. Other arrangements with higher conjectured $\Delta/n^n$ values are in fact known, but we have not been able to obtain proofs that they have large products of distances. Finally, no arrangements such that $\Delta/n^n \to \infty$ are known and we do not know whether they exist.</description>

      <title>On finite local approximations of isometric actions of residually finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any isometric action of a residually finite group admits approximate local finite models. As a consequence, if $G$ is residually finite, every isometric $G$-action embeds isometrically into a metric ultraproduct of finite isometric $G$-actions.</description>

      <title>On Viscosity Solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations in the Wasserstein space and the Vanishing Viscosity Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is twofold. First, we develop a unified framework for viscosity solutions to both first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations and semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations driven by the idiosyncratic operator. Second, we establish a vanishing-viscosity limit-extending beyond the classical control-theoretic setting-for solutions of semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations, proving their convergence to the corresponding first-order solution as the idiosyncratic noise vanishes. Our approach provides an optimal convergence rate.
  We also present some results of independent interest. These include existence theorems for the first-order equation, obtained through an appropriate Hopf-Lax representation, and a useful description of the action of the idiosyncratic operator on geodesically convex functions.</description>

      <title>On planar sections of the dodecahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the analysis of three-dimensional biological microstructures such as organoids, microscopy frequently yields two-dimensional optical sections without access to their orientation. Motivated by the question of whether such random planar sections determine the underlying three-dimensional structure, we investigate a discrete analogue in which the ambient structure is the vertex set of a Platonic solid and the observed data are congruence classes of planar intersections. For the regular dodecahedron with vertex set $V$, we define the planar statistic of a subset $X\subseteq V$ of vertices as the distribution of isometry types of inclusions $\Pi\cap X \subseteq \Pi \cap V \subseteq V$, and ask whether this statistic determines $X$ up to isometry. We show that this is not the case: there exist two non-isometric $7$-element subsets with identical planar statistics.
  As a consequence, there exist two polytopes in $\mathbb R^3$, whose distribution of isometry classes of two-dimensional intersections is identical, while the polytopes are not themselves isometric. This result is an analogue of classical non-uniqueness phenomena in geometric tomography.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>
