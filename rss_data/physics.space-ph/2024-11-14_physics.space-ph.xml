      <title>Graph-GIC: A Smart and Parallelized Geomagnetically Induced Current Modelling Algorithm Based on Graph Theory for Space Weather Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC) refers to the electromagnetic response of the Earth and its conductive modern infrastructures to space weather and would pose a significant threat to high-voltage power grids designed for the alternative current operation. To assess the impact of space weather on the power grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale. In this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm, Graph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a single-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and transmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its electric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and an admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to expedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The Graph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation of the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary analysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC algorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph representation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy calculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This algorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power grid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space weather modelling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Arrival of Multiple Coronal Mass Ejections that Triggered the Gannon Superstorm on May 10, 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The May 10, 2024 space weather event stands out as the most powerful storm recorded during the current solar cycle. This study employs a numerical framework utilizing a semi-empirical coronal model, along with HUXt (Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation with time-dependence) and cone-CME models for the inner heliosphere, to forecast solar wind velocity and the arrival of CMEs associated with this event. The simulations were also carried out using Space Weather Adaptive SimulaTion (SWASTi) and a drag-based model (DBM) for this complex event of multiple CMEs. Predicted arrival times and velocities from these models are compared with actual observations at the Sun-Earth L1 point. These simulations reveal that three coronal mass ejections (CMEs) reached Earth nearly simultaneously, resulting in the extreme space weather event, followed by the arrival of a few more eruptions. The simulations accurately predicted arrival times with a discrepancy of approximately 5 hours or less for these CMEs. Further, the ensemble study of DBM shows the sensitivity of the CME arrival time to the background solar wind speed and drag parameters. All three models have done fairly well in reproducing the arrival time closely to the actual observation of the CMEs responsible for the extreme geomagnetic storm of May 10, 2024. These rare solar storms offered a unique opportunity to thoroughly evaluate and validate our advanced models for predicting their arrival on the Earth.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>
