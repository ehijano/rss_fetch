      <title>Number of Edges in 3-Connected Graphs with Cyclic Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chernyshev, Rauch and Rautenbach [Discrete Math., 2025] introduce forest cuts, i.e., vertex separators that induce a forest. They conjecture that, similar to a result by Chen and Yu [Discrete Math., 2002], every $n$-vertex graph with less than $3n-6$ edges has a forest cut. As an intermediate goal they ask how many edges an $n$-vertex $3$-connected graph must have such that the neighborhood of every vertex contains a cycle. Li, Tang and Zhan [arXiv, 2024] resolve this problem by showing that every such graph has at least $15n/8$ edges, while there are examples of such graphs with exactly $15n/8$ edges. We give a much shorter proof for this.</description>

      <title>Effective Resistance in Simplicial Complexes as Bilinear Forms: Generalizations and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of effective resistance, originally introduced in electrical circuit theory, has been extended to the setting of graphs by interpreting each edge as a resistor. In this context, the effective resistance between two vertices quantifies the total opposition to current flow when a unit current is injected at one vertex and extracted at the other. Beyond its physical interpretation, the effective resistance encodes rich structural and geometric information about the underlying graph: it defines a metric on the vertex set, relates to the topology of the graph through Foster's theorem, and determines the probability of an edge appearing in a random spanning tree. Generalizations of effective resistance to simplicial complexes have been proposed in several forms, often formulated as matrix products of standard operators associated with the complex.
  In this paper, we present a twofold generalization of the effective resistance. First, we introduce a novel, basis-independent bilinear form, derived from an algebraic reinterpretation of circuit theory, that extends the classical effective resistance from graphs. Second, we extend this bilinear form to simplices, chains, and cochains within simplicial complexes. This framework subsumes and unifies all existing matrix-based formulations of effective resistance. Moreover, we establish higher-order analogues of several fundamental properties known in the graph case: (i) we prove that effective resistance induces a pseudometric on the space of chains and a metric on the space of cycles, and (ii) we provide a generalization of Foster's Theorem to simplicial complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Postnikov's Le-diagrams, decorated permutations, and Grassmann necklaces, we classify which positroids are sparse paving matroids. This allows us to enumerate sparse paving positroids, making connections to a known sequence involving the golden ratio and to the Lucas numbers.</description>

      <title>Four plane unit vectors generate a $3$-colorable graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given an arbitrary set of four plane unit vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$, the Cayley graph generated by $\{\pm v_1, \pm v_2, \pm v_3, \pm v_4\}$ is always $3$-colorable. Indeed, we show that this is a specific case of a much more general result wherein we determine the chromatic number of an arbitrary abelian Cayley graph generated by a set of four elements and their negatives, subject to the constraint that the group of relations between those elements has rank no more than $2$.</description>

      <title>Minimal simplicial spherical mappings with a given degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the minimal number of vertices $\lambda(n,d)$ required in a triangulation of the $n$-sphere to admit a simplicial map to the boundary of a $(n+1)$-simplex with a given degree $d$. We establish upper bounds for $\lambda(n,d)$ in dimensions $n \geq 3$ and introduce a new function $\alpha(n):=\limsup_{d \to \infty}{\frac{\lambda(n,d)}{d}}. $ Our main result establishes that it does not exceed $\frac{n+2}{n}$. Furthermore, we provide exact formulas for small values of $d$, showing that $\lambda(n,d)=n+d+3$ for $n \geq 3$ and $d=2,3,4$. A key technical result is the identity $\lambda(n,d) = \lambda(d-1,d) + n - d + 1$ for $n \geq d$, which allows us to reduce higher-dimensional cases to lower-dimensional ones. The proofs involve constructive methods based on local modifications of triangulations and combinatorial arguments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the 3-Token Graph of Particular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the properties of the 3-token graph derived from path graphs, with a particular focus on its structural characteristics and key attributes. We analyze how the 3-token graph is constructed from path graphs and explore fundamental properties such as connectivity, diameter, and chromatic number. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the 3-token graph of the disjoint union of two given graphs, examining its unique features and how the structure of the original graphs influences the resulting 3-token graph. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of token graphs and their applications in graph theory. (We would like to note that an earlier version of this manuscript was previously made available as a preprint on Preprints.org (DOI: 10.20944/preprints202505.1605.v1). The current submission corresponds to the revised version that has been uploaded to arXiv, in accordance with the journal's requirement for preprint deposition. We confirm that both versions refer to the same work and no duplicate submission is intended.)</description>

Abstract: This is the first in a series of two papers dealing with $(2P_3,C_4,C_6)$-free graphs, or equivalently, $(2P_3,\text{even hole})$-free graphs. In this two-paper series, we give a full structural description of $(2P_3,C_4,C_6)$-free graphs that contain no simplicial vertices, and we show that such graphs have bounded clique-width. This implies that Graph Coloring can be solved in polynomial time for $(2P_3,C_4,C_6)$-free graphs. In this paper, we describe the structure of $(2P_3,C_4,C_6)$-free graphs that contain an induced $C_7$ or an induced $T_0$ (where $T_0$ is a certain 2-connected graph on nine vertices in which all holes are of length five), and we show that such graphs either contain a simplicial vertex or have bounded clique-width. In the second part of this series, we describe the structure of all $(2P_3,C_4,C_6,C_7,T_0)$-free graphs that contain no simplicial vertices, and we show that such graphs have bounded clique-width. The full statement of the theorem describing the structure of $(2P_3,C_4,C_6)$-free graphs that contain no simplicial vertices is given in the second paper of this series.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic and Erd\H{o}s-Moon approaches to tournament rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tournament ranking is a function that assigns each vertex of a tournament (i.e., a directed graph without loops, in which each pair of different vertexes is connected by exactly one arc) a number called the rank of the vertex. One of approaches to constructing tournament rankings suggests choosing a ranking that satisfies a fixed set of axioms. In another approach, proposed by Erd\H{o}s and Moon, only injective rankings are considered, and among them, one that minimises the number of backward arcs is selected (an arc $x\to y$ is called backward iff the rank of $x$ is less than the rank of $y$). We combine these two approaches as follows: among the rankings that satisfy a fixed set of axioms, we choose one that minimises the number of backward arcs.
  The Erd\H{o}s-Moon approach naturally leads to the question of how small the proportion of backward arcs can be guaranteed when using injective rankings. Erd\H{o}s and Moon showed that the answer to this question is $1/2$. A similar question arises in our approach: how small the proportion of backward arcs can be guaranteed when using rankings that satisfy a set of axioms $\mathcal{A}$? We call this number the Erd\H{o}s-Moon number of $\mathcal{A}$. We prove that the Erd\H{o}s-Moon number of the Copeland axiom equals $3/4$.</description>

      <title>Subexponential upper bound on the number of rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R(n)$ denote the number of rich words of length $n$ over a given finite alphabet. In 2017 it was proved that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sqrt[n]{R(n)}=1$; it means the number of rich words has a subexponential growth. However, up to now, no subexponential upper bound on $R(n)$ has been presented. The current paper fills this gap. Let $\frac{1}{2}&lt;\lambda&lt;1$ and $\gamma&gt;1$ be real constants, let $q$ be the size of the alphabet, and let $\phi$ be a positive function with $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\phi(n)=\infty$ and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{n}{\phi(n)}=\infty$. Let $\ln^*(x)$ denote the iterated logarithm of $x&gt;0$. We prove that there are $n_0$ and $c&gt;0$ such that if $n&gt;n_0$, \[f(n)=\sqrt[\gamma]{c\ln^*{(\frac{n}{\phi(n)}}\ln{q})}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad B(n)=q^{\frac{n}{\phi(n)}+\frac{n}{(2\lambda)^{f(n)-1}}}\mbox{}\] then $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{B(n)}=1$ and $R(n)\leq B(n)$.</description>

      <title>An Approximation Framework for Parametric Matroid Interdiction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matroid interdiction problems are well-researched in the field of combinatorial optimization. In the matroid $\ell$-interdiction problem, an interdiction strategy removes a subset of cardinality $\ell$ from the matroid's ground set. The goal is to maximize the weight of a remaining optimal basis. We examine the multi-parametric generalization of this problem, where every weight is given by a linear function depending on a parameter vector. For every parameter value, we are interested in an optimal interdiction strategy and the weight of an optimally interdicted basis. We develop the first framework for lifting approximation algorithms for the non-parametric matroid $\ell$-interdiction problem to its multi-parametric variant. Whenever there exists a $\beta$-approximation algorithm for the non-parametric problem, we obtain an approximation algorithm for the multi-parametric problem with an approximation quality arbitrarily close to $\beta$. Our method yields an FPTAS for partition matroids and a $(1-\varepsilon)\frac{1}{4}$-approximation for graphic matroids. As part of the construction, we develop the first approximation algorithm for a conventional multi-parametric optimization problem in which the parameter vector varies in an arbitrary polytope.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Lattice Structures to Hypergraphs: Spectra of Clique and Hyperedge-based Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice structures play a central role in spectral graph theory, offering analytical insight into diffusion, synchronization, and transport processes on regular discrete spaces. While their spectral properties are completely characterized in the classical graph setting, an extension to hypergraphs, where interactions involve more than two nodes, remains largely unexplored in the matrix-based formulation. In this work, we generalize the notion of a lattice to the hypergraph framework and study its Laplacian spectra under two alternative definitions: the clique Laplacian, obtained through pairwise projection, and the hyperedge-based Laplacian, defined via normalized hyperedge incidences. For both definitions, we derive the corresponding Laplacian matrices, analyze their eigenvalue spectra, and discuss how they reflect the underlying topological and dynamical structure of the hyperlattice. Our main result is a theorem giving a full spectral characterization in the periodic case, together with a Toeplitz-type open analogue whose spectrum retains a separable trigonometric structure. The obtained eigenvalues are expressed explicitly in terms of the hyperedge size, the number of directional families, and the lattice side length, thereby capturing how the geometry of higher-order interactions shapes the spectral structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the concept of positive definite functions on finite groups, we present a new necessary condition for the existence of Butson Hadamard matrices $BH(n,q)$. We use this condition to prove some nonexistence results for a sequence of values of $(n,q)$, and also to facilitate a computer search and discover a matrix $BH(18,14)$. Furthermore, we use cyclotomic cosets to construct matrices $BH(34,10)$, $BH(62,6)$, $BH(82,6)$, and $BH(146,6)$ for the first time. These matrices have a $2$-circulant structure.</description>

      <title>$q$-analogs of rational numbers: from Ostrowski numeration systems to perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $q$-deformation of rational numbers introduced recently by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko. We propose three enumerative interpretations of these $q$-rationals: in terms of a new version of Ostrowski's numeration system for integers, in terms of order ideals of fence posets and in terms of perfect matchings of snake graphs. Contrary to previous results which are restricted to rational numbers greater than one, our interpretations work for all positive rational numbers and are based on a single combinatorial object for defining both the numerator and denominator. The proofs rest on order-preserving bijections between posets over these objects. We recover a formula for a $q$-analog of Markoff numbers. We also deduce a fourth interpretation given in terms of the integer points inside a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^k$ on both sides of a hyperplane where $k$ is the length of the continued fraction expansion.</description>

      <title>Ore-type condition for antidirected Hamilton cycles in oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antidirected cycle in a digraph $G$ is a subdigraph whose underlying graph is a cycle, and in which no two consecutive arcs form a directed path in $G$. Let $\sigma_{+-}(G)$ be the minimum value of $d^+(x)+d^-(y)$ over all pairs of vertices $x, y$ such that there is no arc from $x$ to $y$, that is, $$\sigma_{+-}(G)=\min\{d^+(x)+d^-(y): \{x,y\}\subseteq V(G), xy\notin E(G)\}.$$ In 1972, Woodall extended Ore's theorem to digraphs by showing that every digraph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\sigma_{+-}(G)\geqslant n$ contains a directed Hamilton cycle. Very recently, this result was generalized to oriented graphs under the condition $\sigma_{+-}(G)\geqslant(3n-3)/4$. In this paper, we give the exact Ore-type degree threshold for the existence of antidirected Hamilton cycles in oriented graphs. More precisely, we prove that for sufficiently large even integer $n$, every oriented graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\sigma_{+-}(G)\geqslant(3n+2)/4$ contains an antidirected Hamilton cycle. Moreover, we show that this degree condition is best possible.</description>

      <title>On the gracesize of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex tree $T$ is said to be $\textit{graceful}$ if there exists a bijective labelling $\phi:V(T)\to \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that the edge-differences $\{|\phi(x)-\phi(y)| : xy\in E(T)\}$ are pairwise distinct. The longstanding graceful tree conjecture, posed by R\'{o}sa in the 1960s, asserts that every tree is graceful. The $\textit{gracesize}$ of an $n$-vertex tree $T$, denoted $\operatorname{gs}(T)$, is the maximum possible number of distinct edge-differences over all bijective labellings $\phi:V(T)\to \{1,\ldots,n\}$. The graceful tree conjecture is therefore equivalent to the statement that $\operatorname{gs}(T)=n-1$ for all $n$-vertex trees.
  We prove an asymptotic version of this conjecture by showing that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists $n_0$ such that every tree on $n&gt;n_0$ vertices satisfies $\operatorname{gs}(T)\geqslant (1-\varepsilon)n$. In other words, every sufficiently large tree admits an almost graceful labelling.</description>

      <title>Advancing the R\"{o}dl Nibble: New bounds on matchings and the list chromatic index of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a $(k+1)$-uniform hypergraph which is nearly $D$-regular, such that any set of $i$ vertices is contained in at most $D_i$ edges of $H$ for each $i = 2, 3, \dots, k+1$. Influential results of Pippenger and of Frankl and R\"odl show that the \textit{R\"odl Nibble} -- a probabilistic procedure which iteratively constructs a matching in small bits -- can produce an almost-perfect matching in $H$, provided $D_2$ is much smaller than $D$. The quantitative aspects of this result were sharpened by several authors, with the previously best-known result due to Vu, whose result takes more of the codegree sequence $D_2, \dots, D_{k+1}$ into account. We improve Vu's result, by showing the R\"odl Nibble can ``exhaust'' the full codegree sequence up to one of several natural bottlenecks, even tolerating extensive ``clustering'' of codegree values. Up to a subpolynomial error term, we believe our result to be the optimal usage of pure nibble methodology.
  We also show that our matching can be taken to be ``pseudorandom'' with respect to a set of weight functions on $V(H)$, and we use this result to derive other hypergraph matching results in partite settings, including a new bound on the list chromatic index which implies the best-known result of Molloy and Reed up to the error term, and is stronger when the hypergraph is not close to linear, i.e.\ $D_2=\omega(1)$. We also apply our results to obtain improved bounds on almost-spanning structures in Latin squares and designs, and the maximum diameter of a simplicial complex.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of Chow rings of direct sums of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two dual recursive decompositions as a graded $\underline{\mathrm{CH}}(M)\otimes \underline{\mathrm{CH}}(N)$-module of the Chow ring $\underline{\mathrm{CH}}(M\oplus N)$ of the direct sum of matroids. We use this to obtain a decomposition of $\underline{\mathrm{CH}}(M\oplus N)$ into irreducible $\underline{\mathrm{CH}}(M) \otimes \underline{\mathrm{CH}}(N)$-modules. The result implies a new recursive formula for the Eulerian numbers. Similarly, we find a recursive decomposition of the augmented Chow ring $\mathrm{CH}(M \oplus N)$ into $\mathrm{CH}(M)\otimes \mathrm{CH}(N)$-modules, generalizing some of the results of arXiv:2002.03341. We prove analogous decompositions of (augmented) Chow polynomials of weakly ranked posets in the sense of arXiv:2411.04070.</description>

      <title>Vertex-transitive graphs with uniformly bisecting quasi-geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $X$ is an infinite, connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph with the property that every bi-infinite quasi-geodesic uniformly coarsely separates $X$ into exactly two deep pieces. We show that such an $X$ is quasi-isometric to either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic plane. In particular, if $X$ is a Cayley graph of a finitely generated group $G$ with the above property, then $G$ is a virtual surface group. This can be interpreted as an extension of the well-known fact that a hyperbolic group with circular boundary is virtually Fuchsian.
  Our theorem positively resolves Problem 14.98 of the Kourovka Notebook, posed by V. A. Churkin in 1999. The proof uses an isoperimetric inequality of Varopoulos to show that if such a graph has the above property, then either it is hyperbolic or has quadratic growth.</description>

      <title>Nucleolus, Happy Nucleolus, and Vehicle Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the recently introduced fair division concept of the happy nucleolus for cost allocation among players in a cooperative game, with special focus on its computation. The happy nucleolus applies the same fairness criterion as the well-established nucleolus but with reduced total value. Still, we show that the relation between the two concepts is quite involved, and intuitive properties do not hold - e.g., the entry of a player in the happy nucleolus can be larger than the entry of the same player in the nucleolus, even for monotone and subadditive games. This refutes conjectures of Meir, Rosenschein and Malizia (2011).
  Further, we study the separation problem of the linear programs appearing in the MPS scheme for computing the (happy) nucleolus. It includes linear subspace avoidance constraints, which can be handled efficiently for problems with a certain dynamic programming formulation due to K\"ohnemann and Toth (2020). We show how to get rid of these constraints for all monotone games if we allow for an arbitrarily small error of epsilon, thus conserving known approximation guarantees for the same problem without subspace avoidance.
  Finally, we focus on practical results at the example of vehicle routing games by designing an efficient heuristic based on our previous insights and past work, and demonstrate its power.</description>

      <title>Defective and Clustered Colouring of Graphs with Given Girth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The defective chromatic number of a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that for some integer $d$, every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is $k$-colourable such that each monochromatic component has maximum degree at most $d$. Similarly, the clustered chromatic number of a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that for some integer $c$, every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is $k$-colourable such that each monochromatic component has at most $c$ vertices. This paper determines or establishes bounds on the defective and clustered chromatic numbers of graphs with given girth in minor-closed classes defined by the following parameters: Hadwiger number, treewidth, pathwidth, treedepth, circumference, and feedback vertex number. One striking result is that for any integer $k$, for the class of triangle-free graphs with treewidth $k$, the defective chromatic number, clustered chromatic number and chromatic number are all equal. The same result holds for graphs with treedepth $k$, and generalises for graphs with no $K_p$ subgraph.</description>

      <title>Components, large and small, are as they should be I: supercritical percolation on regular graphs of growing degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for a regular graph $G$ of growing degree $d$, guaranteeing a phase transition in its random subgraph $G_p$ similar to that of $G(n,p)$ when $p\cdot d\approx 1$. These conditions capture several well-studied graphs, such as (percolation on) the complete graph $K_n$, the binary hypercube $Q^d$, $d$-regular expanders, and random $d$-regular graphs. In particular, this serves as a unified proof for these (and other) cases.
  Suppose that $G$ is a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with $d=\omega(1)$. Let $\epsilon&gt;0$ be a small constant, and let $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{d}$. Let $y(\epsilon)$ be the survival probability of a Galton-Watson tree with offspring distribution Po$(1+\epsilon)$. We show that if $G$ satisfies a (very) mild edge expansion requirement, and if one has fairly good control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then typically the percolated random subgraph $G_p$ contains a unique giant component of asymptotic order $y(\epsilon)n$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$.
  We also show that this result is tight, in the sense that if one asks for a slightly weaker control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then there are $d$-regular graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, where typically the second largest component is of order $\Omega(d\log (n/d))=\omega(\log n)$.
  This is the first of a two-part sequence of papers. In the subsequent work, we consider supercritical percolation on regular graphs of constant degree, and establish similar sufficient (and essentially tight) conditions in that setting.</description>

Abstract: Wagner (1992) proved that the Hadamard product of two P\'olya frequency sequences that are interpolated by polynomials is again a P\'olya frequency sequence. We study whether related combinatorial properties are preserved under Hadamard products. In particular, we show that ultra log-concavity, $\gamma$-positivity, and interlacing symmetric decompositions are preserved. Furthermore, we disprove a conjecture by Fischer and Kubitzke (2014) concerning the real-rootedness of Hadamard powers.</description>

Abstract: The successive works of Terao as well as Stanley revealed that, for graphical arrangements, supersolvability and the existence of nice partitions are equivalent properties, both characterized by chordal graphs. In this paper, we further prove that every nice partition of a graphical arrangement arises precisely from a maximal modular chain in its intersection lattice. Moreover, we establish two converses to classical results of Orlik and Terao on nice partitions.</description>

      <title>Partitions of Graphs into Special Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning the edge set of the complete graph into bipartite subgraphs under certain constraints defined by forbidden subgraphs. These constraints lead to both classical problems, such as partitioning into independent matchings or complete bipartite subgraphs, and novel variants motivated by structural restrictions. Our theoretical framework is inspired by clustering problems in real-world transaction graphs, which can be formulated naturally as edge partitioning problems under bipartite graph constraints.
  The main result of this paper is the proof of the bounds for $\chi'_{2K_2}(n)$, which corresponds to the minimum number of induced $2K_2$-free bipartite subgraphs needed to partition the edges of $K_n$. In addition to this central result, we also present several similar bounds for other forbidden subgraphs on three or four vertices. Some are included primarily for the sake of completeness, to demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach, and some lead to other novel or well-known graph theoretical problems.</description>

      <title>On the one-dimensional extensions of $q$-matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a $q$-analogue of the single-element extensions of matroids for $q$-matroids, which we call one-dimensional extensions. To enumerate such extensions, we define a $q$-analogue of modular cuts and define a certain function which we call a modular cut selector. It assigns each newly appearing one-dimensional subspace to a modular cut. By using these notion, we prove the one-to-one correspondence between the one-dimensional extensions and the modular cut selectors. Furthermore, we define the canonnical representatives of the isomorphic class of the $q$-matroids, which enable us to enumerate non-isomorphic $q$-matroids without the paiwise isomorphism testing. As an application, we develop a classification algorithm for $q$-matroids, and classify all the $q$-matroids on ground spaces over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_3$ of dimension $4$ and $5$ respectively. We also determine some $5$-dimensional $q$-matroids related to the $q$-Fano plane, which is the $q$-analogue of the Fano plane, over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>A quotient-lifting approach to the Hamiltonicity of the cylindrical 5-puzzle graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an explicit Hamiltonian cycle in the state graph of the 5-puzzle on a toroidal 2x 3 grid, a graph with 720 vertices. The cycle is described by a short symbolic sequence of 48 moves over the alphabet {L,R,V}, repeated $15$ times, which can be verified directly. We also find a shorter 24-move sequence whose repetition yields a 2-cycle cover, which can be spliced into a Hamiltonian path. These constructions arise naturally from a general method: lifting Hamiltonian cycles from a quotient graph under the action of the puzzle's symmetry group.
  The method produces compact, human-readable cycle encodings and appears effective in broader settings, suggesting a combinatorial grammar underlying Hamiltonian paths in symmetric configuration spaces.</description>

Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Game}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is $m$-joined if there is an edge between every two disjoint $m$-sets of vertices. In this paper, we prove that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and sufficiently large $m, n\in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \le n^{1-\varepsilon}$, every $n$-vertex $m$-joined graph $G$ contains a minor with density $\Omega\!\left(\tfrac{n}{\sqrt{m}}\right)$, which is best possible up to a constant factor. When $m \ge n^{1-\varepsilon}$, we further show that $G$ contains a clique minor of order $\Omega\!\left(\tfrac{n}{\sqrt{m\log m}}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Maximal Cells in Shifted Staircase Tableaux and a Quarter-Circle Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we explicitly compute the probability that a given cell in a random standard Young tableau of the shifted staircase shape $(2n-1, 2n-3, \ldots, 3,1)$ contains the maximal label. We also show that the asymptotic distribution of the cell containing the maximal label is governed by the quarter-circle law. The bijection between the tableaux and thereduced decompositions of the longest element of the group $B_n$ of the signed permutations yields the probability distribution of the first (and any) letter of the random reduced decompositions. We also show the results of some computational experiments on the random sorting networks of $B_n$.</description>

      <title>Homology of matching complexes and representations of symmetric groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the homology of the matching complex $M(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the complete hypergraph on $n\geq 2$ vertices, and analyse the $S_n$-representations carried by this homology. These results are achieved using standard techniques in combinatorial topology, such as the theory of shellings. We then broaden the scope to the larger class of fibre-closed families of simplicial complexes and consider these through the lens of representation stability. This allows us to prove a number of results of an asymptotic nature, such as an analysis of the growth of Betti numbers and the kinds of irreducible $S_n$-representations that appear.</description>

Abstract: Toric topology assigns to each simple convex $n$-polytope $P$ with $m$ facets an $n$-dimensional real moment angle manifold $\mathbb RZ_P$ with a canonical action of $\mathbb Z_2^m=(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^m$. We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on $\mathbb RZ_P$. The orbit space $N(P,H)=\mathbb RZ_P/H$ has an action of $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$. For general $n$ we introduce the notion of a Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex in the boundary of an $n$-polytope $P$ generalizing the notions of a Hamiltonian cycle ($k=2$), Hamiltonian theta-subgraph ($k=3$) and Hamiltonian $K_4$-subgraph ($k=4)$ in the $1$-skeleton of a $3$-polytope. Each $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \partial P$ corresponds to a subgroup $H_C\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $N(P,H_C)\simeq S^n$. We prove that in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. Any subgroup $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ defines a complex $C(P,H)\subset \partial P$. We prove that each Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset C(P,H)$ inducing $H$ corresponds to a hyperelliptic involution $\tau_C\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ on the manifold $N(P,H)$ (that is, an involution with the orbit space homeomorphic to $S^n$) and in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. We prove that for the geometries $\mathbb X= \mathbb S^4$, $\mathbb S^3\times\mathbb R$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb S^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb R^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb L^2$, and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb L^2$ there exists a compact right-angled $4$-polytope $P$ with a free action of $H$ such that the geometric manifold $N(P,H)$ has a hyperelliptic involution in $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, and for $\mathbb X=\mathbb R^4$, $\mathbb L^4$, $\mathbb L^3\times \mathbb R$ and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb R^2$ there are no such polytopes.</description>

      <title>Characterizing semi-directed phylogenetic networks and their multi-rootable variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks are graphs that provide a flexible framework for representing complex evolutionary histories that involve reticulate evolutionary events. Recently phylogenetic studies have started to focus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These graphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of the arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph whose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source or root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit in nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not. In this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of semi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is, mixed graphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have more than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the theory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry picking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a (multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted network that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child, orchard, tree-based or forest-based networks. These results address structural aspects of (multi-)semi-directed networks and pave the way to improved theoretical and computational analyses of such networks, for example, within the development of algebraic evolutionary models that are based on such networks.</description>
