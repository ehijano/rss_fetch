      <title>Nine circles of elastic brittle fracture: A series of challenge problems to assess fracture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.</description>

      <title>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13368v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2 circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime of the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of parameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the much deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering NV Centers via Hydrogen-Driven Defect Chemistry in CVD Diamonds for Quantum Applications: NVHx Dissociations into NV, Origin of 468nm Center, and Cause of Brown Coloration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in advancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism for NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during annealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested mechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond and its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio calculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV centers during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a strong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm luminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the atomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex defects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and spectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to investigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as the NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the characteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy complexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in stabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex defects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth irradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional nitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry underlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds, offering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for quantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of NVHx complexes.</description>

      <title>Origami of Multi-Layered Spaced Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) origami tessellations such as the Miura-ori are often generalized to build three-dimensional (3D) architected materials with sandwich or cellular structures. However, such 3D blocks are densely packed with continuity of the internal material, while for many engineering structures with multi-physical functionality, it is necessary to have thin sheets that are separately spaced and sparsely connected. This work presents a framework for the design and analysis of multi-layered spaced origami, which provides an origami solution for 3D structures where multiple flat sheets are intentionally spaced apart. We connect Miura-ori sheets with sparsely installed thin-sheet parallelogram-like linkages. To explore how this connectivity approach affects the behavior of the origami system, we model the rigid-folding kinematics using analytic trigonometry and rigid-body transformations, and we characterize the elastic-folding mechanics by generalizing a reduced order bar and hinge model for these 3D assemblies. The orientation of the linkages in the multi-layered spaced origami determines which of three folding paths the system will follow including a flat foldable type, a self-locking type, and a double-branch type. When the origami is flat foldable, a maximized packing ratio and a uniform in-plane shear stiffness can be achieved by strategically choosing the link orientation. We show possible applications by demonstrating how the multi-layered spaced origami can be used to build deployable acoustic cloaks and heat shields.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerated Computational Surface-Specific Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Oxidation Level of Graphene in Contact with Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise characterization of the graphene/water interface has been hindered by experimental inconsistencies and limited molecular-level access to interfacial structures. In this work, we present a novel integrated computational approach that combines machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles vibrational spectroscopy calculations to reveal how graphene oxidation alters interfacial water structure. Our simulations demonstrate that pristine graphene leaves the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water largely unperturbed, whereas graphene oxide (GO) with surface hydroxyls induces a pronounced $\Delta f \sim 100 cm^{-1}$ redshift of the free-OH vibrational band and a dramatic reduction in its amplitude. These spectral shifts in the computed surface-specific sum-frequency generation spectrum serve as sensitive molecular markers of the GO oxidation level, reconciling previously conflicting experimental observations. By providing a quantitative spectroscopic fingerprint of GO oxidation, our findings have broad implications for catalysis and electrochemistry, where the structuring of interfacial water is critical to performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU-Accelerated Training of a Neuroevolution Potential with Analytical Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) such as neuroevolution potentials (NEP) combine quantum-mechanical accuracy with computational efficiency significantly accelerate atomistic dynamic simulations. Trained by derivative-free optimization, the normal NEP achieves good accuracy, but suffers from inefficiency due to the high-dimensional parameter search. To overcome this problem, we present a gradient-optimized NEP (GNEP) training framework employing explicit analytical gradients and the Adam optimizer. This approach greatly improves training efficiency and convergence speedily while maintaining accuracy and physical interpretability. By applying GNEP to the training of Sb-Te material systems(datasets include crystalline, liquid, and disordered phases), the fitting time has been substantially reduced-often by orders of magnitude-compared to the NEP training framework. The fitted potentials are validated by DFT reference calculations, demonstrating satisfactory agreement in equation of state and radial distribution functions. These results confirm that GNEP retains high predictive accuracy and transferability while considerably improved computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present Chaoticus, a Python-based package for the GPU-accelerated integration of ODE systems and the computation of chaos indicators, including SALI, GALI, Lagrangian Descriptors based indicators and the Lyapunov exponent spectrum. By leveraging GPU parallelization, our package significantly reduces the computation times by several orders of magnitude compared to CPU-based approaches. This significant reduction in computing time facilitates the generation of extensive datasets, crucial for the in-depth analysis of complex dynamics in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Ab initio density functional theory approach to warm dense hydrogen: from density response to electronic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.</description>

      <title>SINDy on slow manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective method to learn interpretable models of dynamical systems from data. However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression problem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned. Although, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying slow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables have to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate terms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy library. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow manifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of the slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables restricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is leveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains only essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than containing all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom library is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific problem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a snap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that our method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the SINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow manifolds.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of general grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a central part of microstructure evolution, grain boundary (GB) migration is believed to be both monolithic and unidirectional. But here, we introduce the concept of GB decomposition: one GB separates into two new GBs by controlling the Peach-Koehler forces on its disconnections. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to reveal the disconnection mechanisms and direction-dependent motion behaviors associated with the reversible decomposition of a nickel {\Sigma}7 general GB. We also observed a decomposition-like process in a high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) dataset of high purity nickel polycrystal (Science 2021, 374, 189-193), and performed HEDM-data-based simulation to confirm it. The decomposition should be considered as a new GB migration behavior, based on its particularity and potential universality.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of acceptor dopants in monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is a leading ultra-wide band gap semiconductor, but its performance depends on precise control over dopant incorporation and stability. In this work, we use first-principles calculations to systematically assess the diffusion behavior of eight potential deep-level substitutional acceptors (Au, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ni) in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. We consider two key diffusion mechanisms: (i) interstitial diffusion under non-equilibrium conditions relevant to ion implantation, and (ii) trap-limited diffusion (TLD) under near-equilibrium thermal annealing conditions. Our results reveal a strong diffusion anisotropy along the b and c axes, with dopant behavior governed by competition between diffusion and incorporation (or dissociation) activation energies. Under interstitial diffusion, Ca$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ and Mg$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ show the most favorable combination of low migration and incorporation barriers, making them promising candidates for efficient doping along the b and c axes, respectively. In contrast, Au$^{+}_{\text{i}}$ diffuses readily, but exhibits an incorporation barrier that exceeds 5 eV, rendering it ineffective as a dopant. From a thermal stability perspective, Co$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ shows poor activation but high diffusion barriers, which may suppress undesirable migration at elevated temperatures. Under trap-limited diffusion, the dissociation of dopant-host complexes controls mobility. Mg$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ again emerges as a leading candidate, exhibiting the lowest dissociation barriers along both axes, whereas Co$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ and Fe$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ display the highest barriers, suggesting improved dopant retention under thermal stress. Our findings guide dopant selection by balancing activation and thermal stability, essential for robust semi-insulating substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the solution of a three-dimensional, two-body Schr\"odinger equation for scattering states. The equation is first reduced to a system of coupled radial Schr\"odinger equations. The system of differential equations is approximated as an ordinary linear nonhomogeneous system using the finite difference method. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at the origin and at an arbitrary large radius. The physical $K$-matrix for real energies is calculated from the numerical solutions of this system by comparison to the analytical real solutions for large distances. Scattering amplitudes are calculated from the physical $K$-matrix. Scattering poles are obtained by extrapolating the $K$-matrix to complex energies.</description>

      <title>SECRET: Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available at https://git.rwth-aachen.de/pmertsch/secret .</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Parametric State Estimation in Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy-regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate (e.g., on a (001)-oriented substrate) that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>
