      <title>The "Days of Learning" Metric for Education Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third National Charter School Study (NCSS III) aimed to test whether charter school were effective and to highlight outcomes on academic progress. The results showed that typical charter school students outperformed similar students in noncharter public schools by 6 days in mathematics and 16 days in reading. The key metric used to claim better performance in charter schools is "days of learning." In this report, the origin of the days-of-learning metric is explored with NAEP data, and the interpretation of days of learning as within-year growth is considered.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Allocations under Incomplete Information: A Model of Stable Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior literature on two-firm two-market and two-stage extended dynamic models has introduced what Guth (2016) succinctly terms a social dilemma. A state in which conglomerate firms competing in a Bertrand duopoly consider jointly optimizing profits under a tacit self-enforcing agreement to deter market entry. This theoretical article reinterprets the social dilemma highlighted by Guth (2016) not only in the context of allocation but also through the lens of competition where entry must legally be permitted even if cooperative signalling would otherwise sustain joint profitability. This study explores the significance of a sufficiency condition on each firms non-instantaneous reaction function requiring the maintenance of a stable long-run equilibrium through retaliative restraint characterized by either two negative eigenvalues or a saddle-path trajectory.</description>

      <title>An Inverse-Ramsey Tax Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional optimal commodity tax analysis, dating back to Ramsey (1927), prescribes that to maximize welfare one should impose higher taxes on goods with lower demand elasticities. Yet policy makers do not stress minimizing efficiency costs as a desideratum. In this note we revisit the commodity tax problem, and show that the attractiveness of the Ramsey inverse-elasticity prescription can itself be inverted if the tax system is chosen -- or at least strongly influenced -- by taxpayers who are overly confident of their ability, relative to others, to substitute away from taxed goods.</description>

      <title>Community-driven and water quality indicators of sanitation system failures in a rural U.S. community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe sanitation access is commonly believed to be ubiquitous in high-income countries; however, researchers and community advocates have exposed a glaring lack of access for many low-income communities and communities of color across the U.S. While this disparity has been identified and quantified at a high level, local and household-level implications of sanitation failures remain ill-defined. We develop a set of user-based and environmental measures to assess the performance of centralized wastewater systems, septic systems, and straight-piped systems in Lowndes County, Alabama. We combine qualitative, survey, and environmental sampled data to holistically compare user experiences across infrastructure types. This integrated approach reveals new routes of exposure to wastewater through informal household maintenance and system backups and provides evidence for the spread of wastewater-like contamination throughout the community. This work elucidates the severity of sanitation failures in one rural U.S. community and provides a framework to assess sanitation quality in other contexts with limited sanitation access in high-income countries.</description>

      <title>Delayed Detection, Swift Blame: Investor Responses to Advisor Misconduct in Market Downturns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial misconduct in advisory services persists despite ongoing regulatory oversight, raising important questions about its endurance and the nature of retail investor responses. Using detailed FINRA BrokerCheck data - capturing the time from the initiation of misconduct to its detection - we document pronounced heterogeneity in detection lags. Although detection is generally delayed, our analysis reveals that investor responses are markedly swifter during market downturns, suggesting that substantial portfolio losses prompt investors to quickly assign blame to their advisors. These findings contribute to our understanding of how adverse economic environments can trigger more immediate investor reactions, even when overall detection remains sluggish.</description>

      <title>Labor Market Impact on Homelessness: Evidence from Canadian Administrative Data on Shelter Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overwhelming majority of homeless individuals are jobless, despite many expressing a willingness to work. While this strong individual-level link between homelessness and unemployment is well-documented, the broader impact of labor market dynamics on homelessness remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the impact of local labor market conditions on the duration of homelessness, using individuals' homeless shelter usage records as a proxy for measuring their homelessness duration. Specifically, drawing on Canada's National Homelessness Information System data from 2014 to 2017, we analyze how local employment growth and changes in the local employment rate affect shelter usage duration. Our findings reveal that a 1% increase in local employment is associated with a 0.11-quarter (approximately 0.33-month) reduction in the average duration of shelter usage, while a 1% rise in the local employment rate leads to a 0.34-quarter (approximately 1.02-month) reduction. These changes correspond to decreases of 2.9% and 8.9%, respectively, in the average duration of shelter stays. The findings underscore the critical role of employment opportunities in reducing homelessness and lend support to job-oriented policy interventions for the homeless. In addition, the results suggest that demographic disparities-particularly the overrepresentation of Indigenous people and men among the homeless-are partially explained by slower exit rates from homelessness within these groups.</description>

      <title>Google and China's Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Google is blocked in China, Chinese provinces export significantly more to foreign countries that recently searched for them (up to 12 months prior). This attention premium is found mainly at the extensive margin of exports, larger in products that are relatively homogeneous, substitutable, and upstream in the production process, and more pronounced during the COVID pandemic and during the holiday season. The attention premium is not found for Chinese imports from the rest of the world. Our findings attest to online attention as a scarce resource in international trade allocated by importers.</description>

      <title>Are Bushmeat Hunters Profit Maximizers or Simply Brigands of Opportunity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bushmeat hunters on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea use shotguns and snares to capture wild arboreal and ground animals for sale in the Malabo Bushmeat market. Two tools for the analysis of economic efficiency, the production possibilities frontier and isorevenue line, can be used to explain the post hoc changing spatial distribution of takeoff rates of bushmeat. This study analyzes changes in technical efficiencies over time and in different locations for the open access wildlife hunted on Bioko for the last ten years. Due to inadequate refrigeration in the field and the bushmeat market, animals must be sold quickly. The result is a takeoff distribution that is not efficient, consequently too many of the wrong species of animals are harvested. The larger, slower-breeding mammals, such as monkeys disappear before the smaller, faster-breeding mammals, such as blue duikers and pouched rats, promoting a steepening of the production possibilities frontier, inducing a greater takeoff of monkeys than the expected efficient level. Soon after hunters penetrate into a new area, the relative selling price of monkeys exceeds the rate of transformation between ground animals and arboreal animals triggering inefficient and unsustainable harvests</description>

      <title>Forecasting Impacts to the Forest Sector: An Analysis of Key U.S. States and Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several key states in various regions have experienced recent sawtimber as well as pulp and paper mill closures, which have resulted in harmful effects to rural, natural-resource dependent communities. This raises an important research question, how will key macroeconomic and related variables for the U.S. forest sector change in the future for highly forest-dependent states? To address this, we employ a vector error correction (VEC) model to forecast economic trends in three major industries - forestry and logging, wood manufacturing, and paper manufacturing - across six of the most forest-dependent states in the U.S.: Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wisconsin. The forecasting results imply that the forestry and logging industry will largely experience decreases in employment and the number of firms. Wood manufacturing has similar findings, but employment is forecasted to increase in general. Paper manufacturing is forecasted to decrease employment, output, and the number of firms, while wages will remain constant. The analysis highlights how timber-based manufacturing communities may be more resilient than other forestry-based industries in the face of economic disruptions. This type of regional forecasting provides valuable insights for regional policy makers and industry stakeholders, helping them anticipate economic shifts and implement strategies to support affected communities. In addition, the methodology applied in this study can be extended to other non-forestry industries that serve as economic pillars for specific regions such as mining, agriculture, and energy production, offering a framework for assessing economic resilience in resource-dependent communities.</description>

      <title>The optimum mix of storage and backup in a highly renewable, highly reliable European electricity grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the variability of solar and wind energy generation potential in Europe over a 43 year period between 1980-2022 with the MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets. We compare the estimated supply potential to hourly demand data from 36 European countries to calculate the reliability of a highly renewable electricity grid in Europe. We find that in cost-optimised scenarios with onshore wind, solar and storage, but no natural gas, reliably meeting the last 1% of demand represents 36% of the entire system cost. Including small amounts of dispatchable natural gas drastically reduces the cost of a renewable, highly reliable grid: overall system costs fall by 31% when just 1% of total generation is permitted to come from natural gas. Large renewable overbuild factors (greater than $\times$4 peak demand) are required to meet modern grid reliability standards in all scenarios, and wind, rather than solar, dominates the generation mix.</description>

      <title>Career Incentives, Risk-Taking, and Sorting Dynamics: Evidence from Top Financial Advisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine how career concerns influence the behavior and mobility of financial advisers. Drawing on a uniquely comprehensive matched panel that combines employer-employee data with a longstanding national ranking, our study tests predictions from classic career concerns models and tournament theory. Our analysis shows that, in the early stages of their careers, advisers destined for top performance differ significantly from their peers. Specifically, before being ranked, these advisers are twice as likely to obtain a key investment license, experience customer disputes at rates up to seven times higher, and transition to firms with 80% larger total assets. Moreover, we find that top advisers mitigate the potential costs of their higher risk-taking by facing reduced labor market penalties following disciplinary actions. Leveraging exogenous variation from the staggered adoption of the Broker Protocol through an event-study framework, our results reveal dynamic sorting: firms attract high-performing advisers intensely within a short post-adoption period. These findings shed new light on the interplay between career incentives, risk-taking, and labor market outcomes in the financial services industry, with important implications for both firm performance and regulatory policy.</description>

      <title>When do firms sell high durability products? The case of light bulb industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study empirically investigates firms' incentives on the choice of product durability, and its social optimality, by developing a dynamic structural model of durable goods with forward-looking consumers and oligopolistic multi-product firms. Based on the observations of the light bulb market, it specifies a model where firms produce multiple products with different durability levels and set product prices based on dynamic incentives. It proposes and applies novel estimation algorithms that alleviate the computational burden and data requirement for estimating demand and marginal cost parameters of dynamic demand models. Using light bulb market data in Japan, structural parameters are estimated. This study obtains the following results. First, large firms have incentives to collude to eliminate high durability incandescent lamps, though it is profitable to sell them for each firm. In contrast, when they can collude on prices, they don't have incentives to eliminate high durability bulbs. Second, eliminating high durability incandescent lamps leads to larger producer and total surplus, though it leads to lower consumer surplus.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for the Deployment of Automated Vehicles in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is expected to address road transport externalities (e.g., safety, traffic, environmental impact, etc.). For this reason, a legal framework for their large-scale market introduction and deployment is currently being developed in the European Union. Despite the first steps towards road transport automation, the timeline for full automation and its potential economic benefits remains uncertain. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it presents a methodological framework to determine deployment pathways of the five different levels of automation in EU27+UK to 2050 under three scenarios (i.e., slow, medium baseline and fast) focusing on passenger vehicles. Second, it proposes an assessment of the economic impact of AVs through the calculation of the value-added. The method to define assumptions and uptake trajectories involves a comprehensive literature review, expert interviews, and a model to forecast the new registrations of different levels of automation. In this way, the interviews provided insights that complemented the literature and informed the design of assumptions and deployment trajectories. The added-value assessment shows additional economic activity due to the introduction of automated technologies in all uptake scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ambitious forest biodiversity conservation under scarce public funds: Introducing a deferrence mechanism to conservation auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Union's Biodiversity Strategy sets an ambitious goal to increase the area of protected land and sea to 30% with 10% devoted to strict protection by 2030. The large land areas required to fulfil the conservation target and the quick schedule of implementation challenge both the current policy instruments and public funding for conservation. We introduce a deferrence mechanism for forest conservation by using procurement auctions. Deferring the conservation payments allows the government to conserve large areas in a quicker schedule and distributing the financial burden of conservation cost for a longer period of time. The deferred payments are paid an interest. The interest earning and an auction mechanism for downpayments strengthens the incentives for landowners to take part in conservation. We characterize the general properties of the mechanism and run numerical simulations to find that the deferrence mechanism facilitates a quick conservation of stands and thereby minimizes the loss of ecologically valuable sites caused by harvesting risks. The analysis suggests that keeping the lending period no longer than 10 years and paying a 3% interest rate provides a compromise that works rather well and outperforms the up-front mechanism in most cases.</description>

      <title>Foreign Direct Investment and Job Creation in EU Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on job creation across 109 regions in the old EU member states from 2012 to 2023. Using dynamic and spatial econometric models combined with a unique dataset of FDI projects, we find that increased FDI inflows significantly enhance regional job creation, but the relationship is nonlinear. Sectoral specialization plays a crucial role, as more concentrated FDI inflows lead to higher employment growth. Furthermore, FDI-driven job creation exhibits significant spatial spillover effects. However, regions attracting high-value FDI jobs, such as those in R&amp;D and management, tend to experience slower overall employment growth.</description>

      <title>Surge sourcing via hybrid supply in a sharing economy: a resource-efficient, progressive and sustainable way to satisfy surge demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a surge sourcing approach to address occasional synchronous high demand (surge demand) in sharing economy systems, providing a socio-economically progressive alternative to surge pricing. Instead of suppressing demand among disadvantaged consumers, our scheme increases supply by involving privileged consumer-providers (prosumers) who under-utilize their resources. This hybrid supply approach maintains high quality-of-service (QoS) for both consumers and prosumers in both normal and surge demand situations without surge pricing. To ensure prosumer QoS, we reserve a small portion of the primary supply to meet their needs if their resources become unavailable during surge periods. As the probability of such events is low compared to that of the surge demand itself, the reserved resources required are minimal. The resulting scheme is resource-efficient, socially progressive, and sustainable, exploiting under-used resources. We illustrate our scheme through two applications: high-range car sharing for owners of small EVs, and shared charging points for EV drivers.</description>

      <title>InfoBid: A Simulation Framework for Studying Information Disclosure in Auctions with Large Language Model-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online advertising systems, publishers often face a trade-off in information disclosure strategies: while disclosing more information can enhance efficiency by enabling optimal allocation of ad impressions, it may lose revenue potential by decreasing uncertainty among competing advertisers. Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.</description>

      <title>Randomization to Reduce Terror Threats at Large Venues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can randomness be better than scheduled practices, for securing an event at a large venue such as a stadium or entertainment arena? Perhaps surprisingly, from several perspectives the answer is "yes." This note examines findings from an extensive study of the problem, including interviews and a survey of selected venue security directors. That research indicates that: randomness has several goals; many security directors recognize its potential; but very few have used it much, if at all. Some fear they will not be able to defend using random methods if an adversary does slip through security. Others are concerned that staff may not be able to perform effectively. We discuss ways in which it appears that randomness can improve effectiveness, ways it can be effectively justified to those who must approve security processes, and some potential research or regulatory advances.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trust in Inter-Organisational Data Sharing: Levels of Assurance for Data Trustworthiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As data is increasingly acknowledged as a highly valuable asset, much effort has been put into investigating inter-organisational data sharing, aiming at utilising the value of formerly unused data. Moreover, most researchers agree, that trust between actors is key for successful data sharing activities. However, existing research oftentimes focus on trust from a data provider perspective. Therefore, our work highlights the unbalanced view of trust, addressing it from a data consumer perspective. More specifically, our aim is to investigate trust enhancing measures on a data level, that is data trustworthiness. We found, that existing data trustworthiness enhancing solutions do not meet the requirements of the domain of inter-organisational data sharing. Therefore, our study addresses this gap. Conducting a rigorous design science research approach, this work proposes a new Levels of Assurance for Data Trustworthiness artifact. Built on existing artifacts, we demonstrate, how it addresses the identified challenges within the domain appropriately. We found that our novel approach requires more work to be suitable for adoption. Still, we are confident that our solution can increase consumer trust. We conclude by contributing to the body of design knowledge and emphasise the need for more attention to be put into consumer trust.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Mitigating Agricultural Price Volatility Using Climate Scenarios and Risk Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural price volatility challenges sustainable finance, planning, and policy, driven by market dynamics and meteorological factors such as temperature and precipitation. In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system acts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without premium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for soybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat). Using ERA5-Land reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we analyze historical climate patterns and evaluate two scenarios: SSP2.4.5 (moderate case) and SSP5.8.5 (severe case). Our findings show that weather conditions strongly influence price fluctuations and that integrating meteorological data into volatility models enhances risk-hedging. Using the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model, we estimate conditional price volatility and identify cross-correlations between weather and price volatility movements. Recognizing MSP's equivalence to a European put option, we apply the Black-Scholes model to estimate its implicit premium, quantifying its fiscal cost. We propose this novel market-based risk-hedging mechanism wherein the government purchases insurance equivalent to MSP, leveraging Black-Scholes for accurate premium estimation. Our results underscore the importance of meteorological data in agricultural risk modeling, supporting targeted insurance and strengthening resilience in agricultural finance. This climate-informed financial framework enhances risk-sharing, stabilizes prices, and informs sustainable agricultural policy under growing climate uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Network-based diversification of stock and cryptocurrency portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maintaining a balance between returns and volatility is a common strategy for portfolio diversification, whether investing in traditional equities or digital assets like cryptocurrencies. One approach for diversification is the application of community detection or clustering, using a network representing the relationships between assets. We examine two network representations, one based on a standard distance matrix based on correlation, and another based on mutual information. The Louvain and Affinity propagation algorithms were employed for finding the network communities (clusters) based on annual data. Furthermore, we examine building assets' co-occurrence networks, where communities are detected for each month throughout a whole year and then the links represent how often assets belong to the same community. Portfolios are then constructed by selecting several assets from each community based on local properties (degree centrality), global properties (closeness centrality), or explained variance (Principal component analysis), with three value ranges (max, med, min), calculated on a maximal spanning tree or a fully connected community sub-graph. We explored these various strategies on data from the S\&amp;P 500 and the Top 203 cryptocurrencies with a market cap above 2M USD in the period from Jan 2019 to Sep 2022. Moreover, we study into more details the periods of the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak and the start of the war in Ukraine. The results confirm some of the previous findings already known for traditional stock markets and provide some further insights, while they reveal an opposing trend in the crypto-assets market.</description>

      <title>India's residential space cooling transition: Decarbonization ambitions since the turn of millennium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an emerging emitter poised for significant growth in space cooling demand, India requires comprehensive insights into historical emission trends and decarbonization performance to shape future low-carbon cooling strategies. By integrating a bottom-up demand resource energy analysis model and a top-down decomposition method, this study is the first to conduct a state-level analysis of carbon emission trends and the corresponding decarbonization efforts for residential space cooling in urban and rural India from 2000 to 2022. The results indicate that (1) the carbon intensity of residential space cooling in India increased by 292.4% from 2000 to 2022, reaching 513.8 kilograms of carbon dioxide per household. The net state domestic product per capita, representing income, emerged as the primary positive contributor. (2) The increase in carbon emissions from space cooling can be primarily attributed to the use of fans. While fan-based space cooling has nearly saturated Indian urban households, it is anticipated to persist as the primary cooling method in rural households for decades. (3) States with higher decarbonization potential are concentrated in two categories: those with high household income and substantial cooling appliance ownership and those with pronounced unmet cooling demand but low household income and hot climates. Furthermore, it is believed that promoting energy-efficient building designs can be prioritized to achieve affordable space cooling. Overall, this study serves as an effective foundation for formulating and promoting India's future cooling action plan, addressing the country's rising residential cooling demands and striving toward its net-zero goal by 2070.</description>

      <title>Critical Mathematical Economics and Progressive Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present elements and discuss the potential of a research program at the intersection between mathematics and heterodox economics, which we call Criticial Mathematical Economics (CME). We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature as an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project.
  From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets'. We identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The first part focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called ``Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu''-Theorems.
  The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics. We exemplify this idea by describing how methods from Non-Linear Dynamics have been used in Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics', and also discuss (Pseudo-) Goodwin cycles and possible Micro- and Mesofoundations.
  Finally, we outline in which areas a collaboration between mathematicians and heterodox economists could be most promising, and discuss both existing projects in such a direction as well as areas where new models for policy advice are most needed. In an outlook, we discuss the role of (ecological) data, and the need for what we call Progressive Data Science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical note provides comprehensive derivations of fundamental equations in two-level nested and sequential logit models for analyzing hierarchical choice structures. We present derivations of the Berry (1994) inversion formula, nested inclusive values computation, and multi-level market share equations, complementing existing literature. While conceptually distinct, nested and sequential logit models share mathematical similarities and, under specific distributional assumptions, yield identical inversion formulas-offering valuable analytical insights. These notes serve as a practical reference for researchers implementing multi-level discrete choice models in empirical applications, particularly in industrial organization and demand estimation contexts, and complement Mansley et al. (2019).</description>
