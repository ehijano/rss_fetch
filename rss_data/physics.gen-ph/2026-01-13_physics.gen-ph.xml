      <title>Emergent spacetime from spatial energy potentiality: a new theoretical framework for early universe cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18524v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive cosmological framework based on the principle that our universe originated as a three-dimensional spatial configuration governed purely by energy functionals, with time emerging dynamically through quantum loop corrections. Building on the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity-Effective Field Theory (USMEG-EFT), which provides the first successful unification of quantum gravity with the Standard Model, we demonstrate that spacetime emergence occurs via a first-order phase transition when quantum-generated kinetic terms exceed a critical threshold. This transition naturally resolves the cosmological singularity problem: all curvature invariants remain finite, with $R/M_P^4 \sim 10^{-44}$ and $K/M_P^8 \sim 10^{-88}$ at the critical point. The framework makes definitive, parameter-free predictions for gravitational wave polarizations, exactly two tensor modes confirmed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations at $&gt;99\%$ confidence, excluding competing approaches that predict additional scalar, vector, or modified polarization content. Post-emergence dynamics naturally implements Starobinsky inflation with spectral index $n_s = 0.964$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 0.004$, in excellent agreement with Planck constraints. The phase transition dynamics generate enhanced primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local} \in [0.8, 2.5]$, testable with CMB-S4 (projected $\sigma \sim 1$), and a stochastic gravitational wave background peaking in the LISA sensitivity band ($f \sim 10^{-4}$ Hz, $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-6}$). The framework naturally addresses the Hubble tension through scale-dependent modifications to cosmic expansion arising from residual phase transition effects.</description>

      <title>Cosmic acceleration as a saddle-node bifurcation: background identities and structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the late-time acceleration of the universe can be understood as a codimension-one bifurcation of the Friedmann dynamical system in the variables $(H,\Omega)$. At a critical value of the density-parameter combination, a saddle-node bifurcation occurs; beyond the saddle-node, trajectories are globally attracted to a new accelerating fixed point. We obtain a normal form and a versal unfolding for the reduced dynamics, proving robustness (structural stability) of the phenomenon and deriving the characteristic square-root splitting of the emerging equilibria. We interpret the unfolding parameter as a measure of departure from adiabaticity via a modified continuity/entropy balance, thus linking acceleration to controlled non-equilibrium evolution rather than to a cosmological constant. In particular, late-time acceleration arises without invoking a separate dark-energy fluid; it emerges from a bounded unfolding of the background flow around a saddle-node organizing center. We situate this within a broader "general-relativity landscape," where control parameters act as moduli and branches of exact solutions appear as equilibrium loci, allowing bifurcation-theoretic tools to organize cosmological dynamics without introducing extra fields, and suggesting a coherent, bifurcation-guided cosmic history.</description>

      <title>The Dirac equation: historical context, comparisons with the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations, and elementary consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers educational insight into the Dirac equation, examining its historical context and contrasting it with the earlier Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon (KG) equations. The comparison highlights their Lorentz transformation symmetry and potential probabilistic interpretations. We explicitly solve the free-particle dynamics in Dirac's model, revealing the emergence of negative-energy solutions. This discussion examines the Dirac Sea Hypothesis and explores the solutions' inherent helicity. Additionally, we demonstrate how the Dirac equation accounts for spin and derive the Pauli equation in the non-relativistic limit. The Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation reveals how the equation incorporates spin-orbit interaction and other relativistic effects, ultimately leading to the fine structure of hydrogen. A section on relativistic covariant notation is included to emphasize the invariance of the Dirac equation, along with more refined formulations of both the KG and Dirac equations. Designed for undergraduate students interested in the Dirac equation, this resource provides a historical perspective without being purely theoretical. Our approach underscores the significance of a pedagogical method that combines historical and comparative elements to profoundly understand the role of the Dirac equation in modern physics.</description>
