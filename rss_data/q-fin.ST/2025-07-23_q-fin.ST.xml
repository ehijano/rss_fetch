      <title>Analysing Models for Volatility Clustering with Subordinated Processes: VGSA and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a comprehensive class of time-changed stochastic processes constructed by subordinating Brownian motion with Levy processes, where the subordination is further governed by stochastic arrival mechanisms such as the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) and Chan Karolyi Longstaff Sanders (CKLS) processes. These models extend classical jump frameworks like the Variance Gamma (VG) and CGMY processes, allowing for more flexible modeling of market features such as jump clustering, heavy tails, and volatility persistence. We first revisit the theory of Levy subordinators and establish strong consistency results for the VG process under Gamma subordination. Building on this, we prove asymptotic normality for both the VG and VGSA (VG with stochastic arrival) processes when the arrival process follows CIR or CKLS dynamics. The analysis is then extended to the more general CGMY process under stochastic arrival, for which we derive analogous consistency and limit theorems under positivity and regularity conditions on the arrival process. A simulation study accompanies the theoretical work, confirming our results through Monte Carlo experiments, with visualizations and normality testing (via Shapiro-Wilk statistics) that show approximate Gaussian behavior even for processes driven by heavy-tailed jumps. This work provides a rigorous and unified probabilistic framework for analyzing subordinated models with stochastic time changes, with applications to financial modeling and inference under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/xymmmm00/diffusion_factor_model.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</description>

      <title>The Subtle Interplay between Square-root Impact, Order Imbalance &amp; Volatility: A Unifying Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07711v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to reconcile several apparently contradictory observations in market microstructure: is the famous "square-root law" of metaorder impact, which decays with time, compatible with the random-walk nature of prices and the linear impact of order imbalances? Can one entirely explain the volatility of prices as resulting from the flow of uninformed metaorders that mechanically impact them? We introduce a new theoretical framework to describe metaorders with different signs, sizes and durations, which all impact prices as a square-root of volume but with a subsequent time decay. We show that, as in the original propagator model, price diffusion is ensured by the long memory of cross-correlations between metaorders. In order to account for the effect of strongly fluctuating volumes q of individual trades, we further introduce two q-dependent exponents, which allow us to describe how the moments of generalized volume imbalance and the correlation between price changes and generalized order flow imbalance scale with T. We predict in particular that the corresponding power-laws depend in a non-monotonic fashion on a parameter a, which allows one to put the same weight on all child orders or to overweight large ones, a behaviour that is clearly borne out by empirical data. We also predict that the correlation between price changes and volume imbalances should display a maximum as a function of a, which again matches observations. Such noteworthy agreement between theory and data suggests that our framework correctly captures the basic mechanism at the heart of price formation, namely the average impact of metaorders. We argue that our results support the "Order-Driven" theory of excess volatility, and are at odds with the idea that a "Fundamental" component accounts for a large share of the volatility of financial markets.</description>
