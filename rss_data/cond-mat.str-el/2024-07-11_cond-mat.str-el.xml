      <title>Successive electron-vortex binding in quantum Hall bilayers at $\nu=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in a quantum Hall fluid can bind with an integer number of vortices to form composite fermions and composite bosons. We show that the quantum Hall bilayer at filling $\nu=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}$ with interlayer separation $d$ can be well-described in terms of these composite particles. At small $d$ the system can be understood as interlayer paired electrons and holes, whereas at large $d$ the system is best understood in terms of composite fermions with four vortices attached to each electron. By computing the overlaps of trial wavefunctions with the ground state from exact diagonalization, we find that as $d$ increases, the number of vortices that attach to each electron increases. We also construct trial states for two types of excitation, the Goldstone mode and a meron excitation. These two trial states have good overlaps with the lowest excited states in the exact diagonalization spectrum for small and intermediate $d$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Analytic framework for self-dual criticality in $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the putative multicritical point in 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory where the Higgs and confinement transitions meet. The presence of an $e$-$m$ duality symmetry at this critical point forces anyons with nontrivial braiding to close their gaps simultaneously, giving rise to a critical theory that mixes strong interactions with mutual statistics. An effective U(1) $\times$ U(1) gauge theory with a mutual Chern-Simons term at level $k$ is proposed to describe the vicinity of the multicritical point for $k \geq 4$. We argue analytically that monopoles are irrelevant in the IR CFT and compute the scaling dimensions of the leading duality-symmetric/anti-symmetric operators. In the large $k$ limit, these scaling dimensions approach $3 - \nu_{\rm XY}^{-1}$ as $1/k^2$, where $\nu_{\rm XY}$ is the correlation length exponent of the 3D XY model.</description>

      <title>A QCA for every SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three dimensions, there is a nontrivial quantum cellular automaton (QCA) which disentangles the three-fermion Walker--Wang model, a model whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes of the spacetime manifold. Here we present a conjectured generalization to higher dimensions. For an arbitrary symmetry protected topological phase of time reversal whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes, we construct a corresponding QCA that we conjecture disentangles that phase. Some of our QCA are Clifford, and we relate these to a classification theorem of Clifford QCA. We identify Clifford QCA in $4m+1$ dimensions, for which we find a low-depth circuit description using non-Clifford gates but not with Clifford gates.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries in finite group gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the invertible and non-invertible symmetries of topological finite group gauge theories in general spacetime dimensions, where the gauge group can be Abelian or non-Abelian. We focus in particular on the 0-form symmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified by boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We investigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other topological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped boundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples, including non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic duality symmetry in non-Abelian finite group gauge theories. In particular, we discover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d gauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the Cheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge groups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dynamics in the Chiral Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the extended Kitaev spin liquid state through phonon dynamics. Using a constrained fermionic self-consistent mean-field method, we analyze the quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state for the extended Kitaev model with both the Zeeman term and the perturbative three-spin interaction term $\kappa$. Our results demonstrate the dependence of the stability of the Kitaev QSL state on the field direction, consistent with findings in the literature. Additionally, we calculate the phonon dynamics for acoustic phonons coupled to the Majorana fermion excitations of the Kitaev spin liquid state, discussing the temperature and field evolution of these quantities.</description>

      <title>Raman study of the structural transition in LiVO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy of single-crystalline LiVO$_2$ exhibiting transition to a diamagnetic state below $T_c \sim $500K are reported. Our measurements clearly detect additional peaks in the low-temperature phase, which disappear nearly completely when heated above $T_c$. Proposed $\sqrt{3}$a \times $\sqrt{3}$a lattice reconstruction explains these new Raman peaks by the Brillouin zone folding. The experiment, on the one hand, confirms that the symmetry of the non-magnetic phase is not lower than trigonal, but, on another hand, our thermal cycling study suggests possible stacking faults. This agrees with results of the density functional theory calculations, which show that the energy difference between different types of stacking does not exceed 1 K per formula unit.</description>

      <title>Three-component fractional quantum Hall effect in topological flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the many-body ground states of three-component quantum particles in two prototypical topological lattice models under strong intercomponent and intracomponent repulsions. At band filling $\nu=3/4$ for hardcore bosons, we demonstrate the emergence of three-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect characterized by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix, through exact diagonalization study of four-fold quasidegenerate ground states with a robust spectrum gap and the combined density-matrix renormalization group calculation of fractional drag charge pumping. Further we formulate the topological characterization of FQH states of three-component Bose-Fermi mixtures at various fillings by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix. At last we discuss the possible generalization of our approach to identify non-Abelian three-component spin-singlet FQH states.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are metallic due to self-doping. And the ML also shows features of heavy fermions, which indicates that there may be Kondo physics in 1313-La327. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (La4310). The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL (TL-outer Ni) show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model: a comprehensive Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations can induce rich phenomena at finite temperatures in strongly correlated fermion systems. Here we report a {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) study for the finite-temperature properties of three-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model at half filling. We concentrate on the complete temperature-interaction strength phase diagram of the model, which contains the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phase and metal-insulator crossover (MIC) in the paramagnetic phase. Enabling access to unprecedented system sizes up to $20^3$, we achieve highly accurate results of the N\'{e}el transition temperature for representative values of on-site interaction $U$ via finite-size analysis of AFM structure factor. To quantitatively characterize the MIC above the N\'{e}el transition, we have developed fully new techniques allowing to compute the thermal entropy versus $U$ at fixed temperature and to directly calculate the $U$-derivative of double occupancy in AFQMC simulations. Then combining variously thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish an efficient scheme to precisely determine the boundaries for the MIC by cross-checking different observables. We also demonstrate the temperature dependence of many commonly used observables. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and AFM spin correlation versus hole doping, and demonstrate the persistance of N\'{e}el AFM ordered phase to finite doping with limited results.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of RE2O2CO3 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb) with a rare earth-bilayer of triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystalline samples of RE2O2CO3 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb) with a unique rare-earth bilayer of triangular lattice were synthesized and studied by DC and AC magnetic susceptibility. Data reveals various magnetic ground states including (i) a nonmagnetic ground state for the Pr sample; (ii) long range magnetic ordering for the Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er samples. Besides the Gd sample, they exhibit field-induced spin state transitions. More interestingly, the series spin state transitions in the Nd and Dy samples could be attributed to the field-induced up-up-down (UUD) spin structure. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) measurements of the Er sample suggest a spiral spin structure below its TN; and (iii) a short-range ordering for the Yb sample. The disrupted inter-layer interaction due to the shift of Yb3+ ions within the bilayer prevents long range magnetic ordering down to 30 mK and makes it another Yb-related triangular lattice antiferromagnet that has the potential to realize a quantum spin liquid state.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory for the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (PLG) has attracted significant attention due to its potential for observing exotic quantum states. In this work, we present a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory for the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG. In particular, we focus on the convergence of the Hartree-Fock calculation with various reference fields and discuss the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. We show that the so-called charge neutrality scheme provides an unambiguous result for the Hartree-Fock calculation, as it ensures a convergence with respect to the momentum cutoff. Based on the Hartree-Fock band structure, we further carry out exact diagonalization calculations to explore the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. Our work provides an improved and unified (minimal) theoretical framework to understand the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG and paves the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Computation of Molecular Ground State Energies using Bayesian Optimization with Priors over Surface Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) represent a promising approach to computing molecular ground states and energies on modern quantum computers. These approaches use a classical computer to optimize the parameters of a trial wave function, while the quantum computer simulates the energy by preparing and measuring a set of bitstring observations, referred to as shots, over which an expected value is computed. Although more shots improve the accuracy of the expected ground state, it also increases the simulation cost. Hence, we propose modifications to the standard Bayesian optimization algorithm to leverage few-shot circuit observations to solve VQEs with fewer quantum resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, Bayesian optimization with priors on surface topology (BOPT), by comparing optimizers for molecular systems and demonstrate how current quantum hardware can aid in finding ground state energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>Large anomalous Hall conductivity in kagome Weyl ferrimagnet Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ predicted by density-functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this letter, we propose to realize the tricritical Ising transition with Rydberg atom arrays, taking advantage of the reconfigurability of these systems. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we utilize the analog--digital hybrid nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which can simulate a physical Hamiltonian and perform a digital quantum circuit on the same platform, to measure the correlation function of the fermionic mode. This hybridized protocol provides an experimentally feasible way to reveal the hidden structure of the spacetime SUSY that emerges at the tricritical Ising transition.</description>

      <title>Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations. We show how to solve these Sylvester equations without knowledge of the eigenstates of the undriven many-body system, using the driven Hubbard model as an example. In the limit of high driving frequencies, these solutions reduce to the well-known high-frequency limit of the Floquet-Magnus expansion. We anticipate this method will be useful for describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</description>

Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>

      <title>The XYZ ruby code: Making a case for a three-colored graphical calculus for quantum error correction in spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Lorentz invariance breaking in quantum wires due to Rashba spin-orbit interaction and transverse phonons. Using bosonization, we derive an effective action coupling electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom. Stikingly, at a quantum phase transition between straight and bent wire states, we find a gapped phonon mode and a gapless mode with quadratic dispersion, signaling the breaking of Lorentz invariance. We explore stability conditions for general potentials and propose nano-mechanical back-action as a sensitive tool for detecting this transition, with implications for Sliding Luttinger Liquids and dimensional crossover studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use kinetic theory and the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to derive the hydrodynamics of spin transport in the Haldane-Shastry chain. We obtain analytical expressions for relaxation from weak-domain-wall initial conditions and corresponding predictions for the spin Drude weight. We corroborate the latter against an exact microscopic calculation at infinite temperature and Luttinger-liquid expectations at zero temperature. We further obtain an analytical expression for the long-wavelength dynamics of the longitudinal spin structure factor at all fillings and temperatures. We show that the latter interpolates between an empirically exact expression that we have found at infinite temperature and the long-wavelength limit of the Haldane-Zirnbauer formula at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic and multipolar ordering in f electron systems takes place at low temperatures of order 1--10 Kelvin. Combinations of first-principles with many-body calculations for such low-energy properties of correlated materials are challenging problems. We address multipolar ordering in f electron systems based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with density functional theory. We derive the momentum-dependent multipolar susceptibilities and interactions in two ways: by solving the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation of the two-particle Green's function and by using a recently developed approximate strong-coupling formula. We apply the formalism to the prototypical example of multipolar ordering in CeB6 using the Hubbard-I solver, and demonstrate that the experimental quadrupole transition is correctly reproduced. The results by the approximate formula show good agreement with those by the BS equation. This first-principles formalism for multipolar ordering based on DMFT has applications which are beyond the reach of the traditional RKKY formula. In particular, more itinerant electron systems including 5f, 4d and 5d electrons can be addressed.</description>

Abstract: Although the ground-state energy of the Kitaev spin liquid can be calculated exactly, the associated vison gap energy has to date only been calculated numerically from finite size diagonalization. Here we show that the phase shift for scattering Majorana fermions off a single bond-flip can be calculated analytically, leading to a closed-form expression for the vison gap energy $\Delta = 0.2633J$. Generalizations of our approach can be applied to Kitaev spin liquids on more complex lattices such as the three dimensional hyper-octagonal lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that constraints imposed by strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) along with the presence of certain global symmetries can ensure the reality of eigenspectra of non-Hermitian quantum systems; such a reality cannot be guaranteed by global symmetries alone. We demonstrate this insight for two interacting finite chains, namely the fermionic Nelson-Hatano and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models, none of which has a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. We show analytically that strong HSF and real spectrum are both consequences of the same dynamical constraints in the limit of large interaction, provided the systems have sufficient global symmetries. We also show that a local equal-time correlation function can detect the many-body exceptional point at a finite critical interaction strength above which the eigenspectrum is real.</description>

      <title>Microscopic scale of quantum phase transitions: from doped semiconductors to spin chains, cold gases and moir\'e superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum systems become scale-invariant and can be grouped into universality classes characterized by sets of critical exponents. We have found that despite scale-invariance and universality, the experimental data still contain information related to the microscopic processes and scales governing QPTs. We have found that for many systems, the scaled data near QPTs can be approximated by the generic exponential dependence introduced in the scaling theory of localization; this dependence includes as a parameter a microscopic seeding scale of the renormalization group, $L_0$. We have also conjectured that for interacting systems, the temperature cuts the renormalization group flow at the length travelled by a system-specific elementary excitation over the life-time set by the Planckian time, $\tau_P$=$\hbar/k_BT$. We have adapted this approach for QPTs in several systems and showed that $L_0$ extracted from experiment is comparable to physically-expected minimal length scales, namely (i) the mean free path for metal-insulator transition in doped semiconductor Si:B, (ii) the distance between spins in Heisenberg and Ising chains, (iii) the period of an optical lattice for cold atom boson gases, and (iv) the period of a moir\'e superlattice for the Mott QPT in dichalcogenide bilayers. The metal-insulator transition in Si:P has been explained using a non-interacting version of the model. In two companion papers, we show that in superconducting systems, $L_0$ is comparable to superconducting coherence length, and in quantum Hall systems, to the magnetic length. The developed new method of data analysis identifies microscopic processes leading to QPTs and quantitatively explains and unifies a large body of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls. We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal lattice and the two-dimensional lattice. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. On the two-dimensional lattice, the model is strongly fragmented when the density of domain walls is low and weakly fragmented when the density of domain walls is high. Furthermore, we show that the fragmentation persists at a finite density of domain walls in the thermodynamic limit for the Vicsek fractal lattice and the two-dimensional lattice. We also show that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on a section of the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperature above the N\'{e}el transition, despite of being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of static and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional (3D) Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover state, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the metallic state for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the Widom line, corresponding to the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, the thermoelectric properties in nodal-point semimetals with two bands are discussed. For the two-dimensional (2D) cases, it is shown that the expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients take different values depending on the nature of the scattering mechanism responsible for transport, by considering examples of short-ranged disorder potential and screened charged impurities. An anisotropy in the energy dispersion spectrum invariably affects the thermopower quite significantly, as illustrated by the results for a node of semi-Dirac semimetal and a single valley of graphene. The scenario when a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2D semimetal is also considered. The computations for three-dimensional (3D) cases necessarily involve the inclusion of nontrivial Berry phase effects. In addition to demonstrating the expressions for the response tensors, the exotic behaviour observed in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically analyze the recently reported observation of integer (IQAHE) and fractional (FQAHE) quantum anomalous Hall effects at zero applied magnetic field in pentalayer graphene. Our quantitative activation and variable range hopping transport analysis of the experimental data reveals that the observed IQAHE and FQAHE at different fillings all have similar excitation gaps of the order of $5-10$ K. In addition, we also find that the observed FQAHE manifests a large hidden background contact series resistance &gt;10 k$\Omega$ of unknown origin whereas this contact resistance is much smaller ~500 $\Omega$ in the observed IQAHE. Both of these findings are surprising as well as inconsistent with the well-established phenomenology of the corresponding high-field integer and fractional quantum Hall effects in 2D semiconductor systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a concept for selective excitation of magnetostatic surface waves with quasi-discrete spectrum using spatially patterned femtosecond laser pulses inducing either ultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy or inverse Faraday effect. We micromagnetically simulate excitation of the waves with periodically patterned uni- or bipolar laser impact. Such excitation yields multiple wavepackets propagating with different group velocities, whose dispersion corresponds to the set of quasi-discrete points. In addition, we show that the frequency of the spectral peaks can be controlled by the polarity of the periodic impact and its spatial period. Presented consideration of multiple spatially periodic magnetostatic surface wave sources as a whole enables implementation of a comprehensive toolkit of spatio-temporal optical methods for tunable excitation and control of spin wave parameters</description>

      <title>Phonon Inverse Faraday effect from electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phonon inverse Faraday effect describes the emergence of a DC magnetization due to circularly polarized phonons. In this work we present a microscopic formalism for the phonon inverse Faraday effect. The formalism is based on time-dependent second order perturbation theory and electron phonon coupling. While our final equation is general and material independent, we provide estimates for the effective magnetic field expected for the ferroelectric soft mode in the oxide perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Our estimates are consistent with recent experiments showing a huge magnetization after a coherent excitation of circularly polarized phonons with THz laser light. Hence, the theoretical approach presented here is promising for shedding light into the microscopic mechanism of angular momentum transfer between ionic and electronic angular momentum, which is expected to play a central role in the phononic manipulation of magnetism.</description>
