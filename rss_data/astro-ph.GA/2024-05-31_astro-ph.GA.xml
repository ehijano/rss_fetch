      <title>Dynamics of star clusters with tangentially anisotropic velocity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-precision observations with HST and Gaia enabled new investigations of the internal kinematics of star clusters (SCs) and the dependence of kinematic properties on the stellar mass. These studies raised new questions about the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating stellar systems. We aim to develop a more complete theoretical understanding of how various kinematical properties of stars affect the global dynamical development of their host SCs. We perform N-body simulations of SCs with isotropic, radially anisotropic and tangentially anisotropic initial velocity distributions. We also study the effect of an external Galactic tidal field. We find three main results. First, compared to the conventional, isotropic case, the relaxation processes are accelerated in the tangentially anisotropic models and, in agreement with our previous investigations, slower in the radially anisotropic ones. This leads to, e.g., more rapid mass segregation in the central regions of the tangential models or their earlier core collapse. Second, although all SCs become isotropic in the inner regions after several relaxation times, we observe differences in the anisotropy profile evolution in the outer cluster regions - all tidally filling models gain tangential anisotropy there while the underfilling models become radially anisotropic. Third, we observe different rates of evolution towards energy equipartition (EEP). While all SCs evolve towards EEP in their inner regions (regardless of the filling factor), the outer regions of the tangentially anisotropic and isotropic models are evolving to an "inverted" EEP (i.e., the high-mass stars having higher velocity dispersion than the low-mass ones). The extent (both spatial and temporal) of this inversion can be attributed to the initial velocity anisotropy - it grows with increasing tangential anisotropy and decreases as the radial anisotropy rises.</description>

      <title>Net-zero gas inflow: deconstructing the gas consumption history of a massive quiescent galaxy with JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is discovering increasing numbers of quiescent galaxies 1--2 billion years after the Big Bang, whose redshift, high mass, and old stellar ages indicate that their formation and quenching were surprisingly rapid. This fast-paced evolution seems to require that feedback from AGN (active galactic nuclei) be faster and/or more efficient than previously expected \citep{Xie24}. We present deep ALMA observations of cold molecular gas (the fuel for star formation) in a massive, fast-rotating, post-starburst galaxy at $z=3.064$. This galaxy hosts an AGN, driving neutral-gas outflows with a mass-outflow rate of $60\pm20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and has a star-formation rate of $&lt;5.6$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our data reveal this system to be the most distant gas-poor galaxy confirmed with direct CO observations (molecular-gas mass $&lt; 10^{9.1}$ M$_{\odot}$; &lt;0.8 % of its stellar mass). Combining ALMA and JWST observations, we estimate the gas-consumption history of this galaxy, showing that it evolved with net zero gas inflow, i.e., gas consumption by star formation matches the amount of gas this galaxy is missing relative to star-forming galaxies. This could arise both from preventive feedback stopping further gas inflow, which would otherwise refuel star formation or, alternatively, from fine-tuned ejective feedback matching precisely gas inflows. Our methods, applied to a larger sample, promise to disentangle ejective vs preventive feedback.</description>

      <title>Understanding the unusual life of the Cartwheel galaxy using stellar populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RiGs are the result of the impact between two galaxies, with one of them passing close to the centre of the other, piercing its gaseous and stellar disc. In this framework, the impact generates a shock wave front that propagates within the disc of the target galaxy soon after the encounter, producing a characteristic expanding ring-shaped structure. RiGs represent one of the most extreme environments in which we can study the physical properties of galaxies and the transformations they undergo during collisions. The paradigm RiG is the Cartwheel galaxy at z = 0.03. This galaxy has been the object of both theoretical and observational studies, but the details of the mechanisms that lead to its peculiar morphology and physical properties are still far from clear. We performed a spatially resolved analysis as a function of galactocentric distance, exploiting spectroscopic data from MUSE observations combined with photometric data covering a large wavelength range, from GALEX to JWST/MIRI. Using FIF of the stellar spectra, an analysis of the nebular emission, and joint full spectral and photometry fitting, we derived physical parameters and SFHs in four spatially distinct regions of the galaxy. We find that, apart from the peculiar morphology, a large fraction of the Cartwheel galaxy is not affected by the recent impact from the companion bullet, and retains the characteristics of a typical spiral galaxy. The outer ring is strongly affected by the recent impact, and is completely dominated by stars formed not earlier than 400 Myr ago. Our picture suggests that the collision shock wave, while moving forward to the external region of the galaxy, drags the already formed stars, sweeping the inner areas outwards, as proposed by recent collision models. At the same time, the ages found in the external ring are older than the predicted timescale of the ring expansion after the collision.</description>

      <title>Stellar Streams in the Gaia Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchical model of galaxy formation predicts that the Milky Way halo is populated by tidal debris of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. Due to long dynamical times, debris from the lowest mass objects remains coherent as thin and dynamically cold stellar streams for billions of years. The Gaia mission, providing astrometry and spectrophotometry for billions of stars, has brought three fundamental changes to our view of stellar streams in the Milky Way. First, more than a hundred stellar streams have been discovered and characterized using Gaia data. This is an order of magnitude increase in the number of known streams, thanks to Gaia's capacity for identifying comoving groups of stars among the field Milky Way population. Second, Gaia data have revealed that density variations both along and across stellar streams are common. Dark-matter subhalos, as well as baryonic structures were theoretically predicted to form such features, but observational evidence for density variations was uncertain before Gaia. Third, stream kinematics are now widely available and have constrained the streams' orbits and origins. Gaia has not only provided proper motions directly, but also enabled efficient spectroscopic follow-up of the proper-motion selected targets. These discoveries have established stellar streams as a dense web of sensitive gravitational tracers in the Milky Way halo. We expect the coming decade to bring a full mapping of the Galactic population of stellar streams, as well as develop numerical models that accurately capture their evolution within the Milky Way for a variety of cosmological models. Perhaps most excitingly, the comparison between the two will be able to reveal the presence of dark-matter subhalos below the threshold for galaxy formation (~10^6 Msun), and provide the most stringent test of the cold dark matter paradigm on small scales.</description>

      <title>CHAOS VIII: Far-Ultraviolet Spectra of M101 and The Impact of Wolf-Rayet Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar and nebular properties of 9 H II regions in the spiral galaxy M101 with far-ultraviolet (FUV; ~900-2000 \r{A}) and optical (~3200-10000 \r{A}) spectra. We detect significant C III] 1907,1909 nebular emission in 7 regions, but O III] 1666 only in the lowest-metallicity region. We produce new analytic functions of the carbon ICF as a function of metallicity in order to perform a preliminary C/O abundance analysis. The FUV spectra also contain numerous stellar emission and P-Cygni features that we fit with luminosity-weighted combinations of single-burst Starburst99 and BPASS models. We find that the best-fit Starburst99 models closely match the observed very-high-ionization P-Cygni features, requiring very-hot, young (~&lt; 3 Myr), metal-enriched massive stars. The youngest stellar populations are strongly correlated with broad He II emission, nitrogen Wolf-Rayet (WR) FUV and optical spectral features, and enhanced N/O gas abundances. Thus, the short-lived WR phase may be driving excess emission in several N P-Cygni wind features (955 \r{A}, 991 \r{A}, 1720 \r{A}) that bias the stellar continuum fits to higher metallicities relative to the gas-phase metallicities. Accurate characterization of these H II regions requires additional inclusion of WR stars in the stellar population synthesis models. Our FUV spectra demonstrate that the ~900-1200 \r{A} FUV can provide a strong test-bed for future WR atmosphere and evolution models.</description>

      <title>Signatures of AGN feedback modes: A Green Bean Galaxy with 150 kpc jet-induced radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) hosting extended photoionized nebulae provide us with a unique view of the timescales associated with AGN activity. Here, we present a new Green Bean galaxy (RGB1) at $z=0.304458\pm0.000007$ with large scale jet-induced radio emission. The Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of the radio components show steep spectral indices ($\alpha=-0.85$ to $-0.92$ for the extended regions, and $\alpha=-1.02$ for the faint radio core), and spectral age modeling of the extended radio emission indicates that the lobes are $&gt;$6 Myrs old. It is unclear whether the jet is active, or remnant with an off-time of 2-3 Myr. Several detached clouds lie around the host galaxy up to 37.8 kpc away from the nucleus, and their ionization profile indicates a decline ($\sim$2 dex) in the AGN ionizing photon production over the past $\sim$0.15 Myr. Furthermore, we measure a blue shift for one of the clouds that is spatially coincident with the path of the radio jet. The cloud is likely illuminated by the photoionizing AGN, and potentially underwent an interaction with the relativistic jet. Our multiwavelength analysis suggests that RGB1 was in a phase of jet production prior to the radiatively efficient accretion phase traced by the detached cloud emission. It is unclear whether RGB1 transitioned into a low-excitation radio galaxy or an inactive galaxy over the past $\sim$0.15 Myr, or whether the extended radio and optical emission trace distinct accretion phases that occurred in succession.</description>

      <title>WISDOM Project -- XXI. Giant molecular clouds in the central region of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 613: a steep size -- linewidth relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC~613 is a nearby barred spiral galaxy with a nuclear ring. Exploiting high spatial resolution ($\approx20$ pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array $^{12}$CO(2-1) observations, we study the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the nuclear ring and its vicinity, identifying $158$ spatially- and spectrally-resolved GMCs. The GMC sizes ($R_{\mathrm{c}}$) are comparable to those of the clouds in the Milky Way (MW) disc, but their gas masses, observed linewidths ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}$) and gas mass surface densities are larger. The GMC size -- linewidth relation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}\propto R_{\mathrm{c}}^{0.77}$) is steeper than that of the clouds of the MW disc and centre, and the GMCs are on average only marginally gravitationally bound (with a mean virial parameter $\langle\alpha_{\mathrm{obs,vir}}\rangle\approx1.7$). We discuss the possible origins of the steep size -- linewidth relation and enhanced observed linewidths of the clouds and suggest that a combination of mechanisms such as stellar feedback, gas accretion and cloud-cloud collisions, as well as the gas inflows driven by the large-scale bar, may play a role.</description>

      <title>Optical Extinctions of Inter-Arm Molecular Clouds in M31: A Pilot Study for the Upcoming CSST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent sub-millimeter dust thermal emission observations have unveiled a significant number of inter-arm massive molecular clouds in M31.However,the effectiveness of this technique is limited to its sensitivity,making it challenging to study more distant galaxies.This study introduces an alternative approach,utilizing optical extinctions derived from space-based telescopes,with a focus on the forthcoming China Space Station Telescope(CSST).We first demonstrate the capability of this method by constructing dust extinction maps for 17 inter-arm massive molecular clouds in M31 using the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury(PHAT) data.Our analysis reveals that inter-arm massive molecular clouds with an optical extinction(AV) greater than 1.6 mag exhibit a notable AV excess,facilitating their identification.The majority of these inter-arm massive molecular clouds show an AV around 1 mag,aligning with measurements from our JCMT data.Further validation using a mock CSST RGB star catalog confirms the method's effectiveness.We show that the derived AV values using CSST z and y photometries align more closely with the input values.Molecular clouds with AV&gt;1.6 mag can also be identified using the CSST mock data.We thus claim that future CSST observation could provide an effective way for the detection of inter-arm massive molecular clouds with significant optical extinction in nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>A study on star formation in rotating and magnetized filamentary molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2D dynamic model is utilized to investigate star formation in rotating filamentary molecular clouds (FMCs) amidst magnetic fields. The study reveals that the emergence of field stars is possible under both weak and strong magnetic fields due to the presence of low-density structures. The presence of a strong rotation in a strongly magnetized FMC Plays a crucial role in forming a combination of two binary pairs and two field stars. An intermediate-density structure in the presence of a moderate magnetic field can form a combination of binary stars and field stars, whereas, in very high dense filamentary molecular clouds, a low magnetic field may help to form binary stars or stellar associations. In a rapidly rotating and weakly magnetized highly dense cloud binary stars are formed, whereas, strong rotation and moderate magnetic field help to form stellar associations</description>

      <title>Sloshing and spiral structures breeding a putative radio mini-halo in the environment of a cool-core cluster Abell 795</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral structures and cold fronts in X-rays are frequently observed in cool core galaxy clusters. However, studies on radio mini-haloes associated with such spirals and their physical connections are rare. Here, we present the detection of an extended diffuse radio emission entrained in the X-ray spiral structure in a known cool core cluster Abell 795 (A795). Though the cool core is a sign of the relaxed nature of the clusters, our re-analysed 30 ks Chandra X-ray data of cluster A795 confirms the presence of an interesting log spiral structure of X-ray deficit region complemented by an X-ray excess counter spiral in the residual map, exposing its dynamical activity. Our new analysis of 150 $\&amp;$ 325 MHz GMRT archival data of the cluster confirms the detection of a $\sim180$ kpc ultra-steep ($\alpha\sim-2.7$) diffuse radio structure which was previously reported as a candidate radio mini halo from low sensitive survey maps. This radio emission spans the entire spiral structure ($\sim186$ kpc), enclosed by two previously reported cold fronts. Furthermore, SDSS DR13 optical spectra, as well as GALEX's FUV data, show a considerably low total star formation rate of 2.52 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and having no significant variation in metallicity distribution. We argued that the two-phase (hot and cold) plasma at the cluster core with differential velocity has probably caused the spiral formation and has redistributed the secondary electrons from the central BCG or the pre-accelerated electrons which have been (re-)accelerated by the sloshing turbulence to form the observed candidate radio mini-halo structure. This has been supported by a few previous studies that indicate spiral formation and sloshing turbulence may quench star formation and facilitate smooth metallicity distribution by mixing the gas in the core.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Structure and Self-gravity in the Maddalena Giant Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project for the Maddalena giant molecular cloud (GMC). We decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the observed region into hierarchical substructures using a modified Dendrogram algorithm. We investigate the statistical properties of these substructures and examine the role that self-gravity plays on various spatial scales. The statistics of the mass (M), radius (R), velocity dispersion ({\sigma}v), virial parameter ({\alpha}vir), and sonic Mach number of the substructures are presented. The radius and mass distributions and the {\sigma}v-R scaling relationship of the substructures resemble those reported in previous studies that use non-hierarchical algorithms to identify the entities. We find that for the hierarchical substructures {\alpha}vir decreases as the radius or mass of the substructures increases. The majority of the substructures in the quiescent region of Maddalena GMC are not gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir &gt; 2), while most of the substructures in the star-forming regions are gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir &lt; 2). Furthermore, we find that self-gravity plays an important role on scales of 0.8-4 pc in the IRAS 06453 star-forming region, while it is not an important factor on scales below 5 pc in the non-star-forming region.</description>

      <title>The HST Large Programme on omega Centauri -- VI. The radial gradient of the stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the globular cluster Omega Centauri. Our analysis combines data obtained in this work with previously published HST data from an earlier article of this series and encompasses a broad portion of the cluster's radial extension. Our findings reveal a significant radial variation in the fraction of stars within the two most populous stellar populations showing that one of the main second-population groups (referred to as bMS) is more centrally concentrated than the first-population group (referred to as rMS). Additionally, we explore the spatial variations of the other less populous stellar populations (referred to as MSa and MSd) and find a qualitatively similar, but weaker, radial decrease in the fraction of stars in these populations at larger distances from the cluster centre. Only one of the populations identified (MSe) does not show any significant radial variation.</description>

      <title>A study of interacting galaxies from the Arp-Madore Catalogue: Triggering of star formation and nuclear activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) spectroscopic observations of 95 galaxies from the Arp &amp; Madore (1987) catalogue of peculiar galaxies. These galaxies have been selected because they appear to be in pairs and small groups. These observations have allowed us to confirm that 60 galaxies are indeed interacting systems. For the confirmed interacting sample, we have built a matched control sample of isolated galaxies. We present an analysis of the stellar populations and nuclear activity in the interacting galaxies and compare them with the isolated galaxies. We find a median light (mass) fraction of 55% (10%) in the interacting galaxies coming from stellar populations younger than 2 Gyr and 28% (3%) in the case of the isolated galaxies. More than half of the interacting galaxies are dominated by this young stellar population, while the isolated ones have most of their light coming from older stellar populations. We used a combination of diagnostic diagrams (BPTs and WHAN) to classify the main ionization mechanisms of the gas. The interacting galaxies in our sample consistently show a higher fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) relative to the control sample, which ranges between 1.6 and 4 depending on the combination of diagnostic diagrams employed to classify the galaxies and the number of galaxies considered. Our study provides further observational evidence that interactions drive star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies and can have a significant impact on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A low cosmic-ray ionisation rate in the prestellar core Ophiuchus/H-MM1. Mapping of the molecular ions ortho-H2D+, N2H+, and DCO+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) We have mapped the prestellar core H-MM1 in Ophiuchus in rotational lines of ortho-H2D+ (oH2D+), N2H+, and DCO+ at the wavelength 0.8 mm with the Large APEX sub-Millimeter Array (LAsMA) multibeam receiver of the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope. We also ran a series of chemistry models to predict the abundance distributions of the observed molecules, and to estimate the effect of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate on their abundances. The three line maps show different distributions. The oH2D+ map is extended and outlines the general structure of the core, while N2H+ mainly shows the density maxima, and the DCO+ emission peaks are shifted towards one edge of the core where a region of enhanced desorption has been found previously. According to the chemical simulation, the fractional oH2D+ abundance remains relatively high in the centre of the core, and its column density correlates strongly with the cosmic-ray ionisation rate. Simulated line maps constrain the cosmic-ray ionisation rate per hydrogen molecule to be low, between 5e-18/s and 1e-17/s in the H-MM1 core. This estimate agrees with the gas temperature measured in the core. Modelling line emission of oH2D+ provides a straightforward method of determining the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in dense clouds, where the primary ion, H3+, is not observable.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of AGN-Driven Outflows in the Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3227</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have characterized the ionized, neutral, and warm molecular gas kinematics in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227 using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, Gemini-North's Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We fit multiple Gaussians to several spatially-resolved emission lines observed with long-slit and integral-field spectroscopy and isolate the kinematics based on apparent rotational and outflowing motions. We use the kinematics to determine an orientation for the bicone along which the outflows travel, and find that the biconical structure has an inclination of $40 ^{+5}_{-4}${\deg} from our line of sight, and a half-opening angle with an inner and outer boundary of $47 ^{+6}_{-2}${\deg} and $68 ^{+1}_{-1}${\deg}, respectively. We observe ionized outflows traveling 500 km s$^{-1}$ at distances up to 7$''$ (800 pc) from the SMBH, and disturbed ionized gas up to a distance of 15$''$ (1.7 kpc). Our analysis reveals that the ionized outflows are launched from within 20 pc of the SMBH, at the same location as a bridge of cold gas across the nucleus detected in ALMA CO(2-1) observations. We measure a turnover radius where the gas starts decelerating at a distance of $26 \pm 6$ pc from the AGN. Compared to a turnover radius in the range of $31- 63$ pc from a radiative driving model, we confirm that radiative driving is the dominant acceleration mechanism for the narrow line region (NLR) outflows in NGC 3227.</description>

      <title>Active Dwarf Galaxy Database I: Overlap between active galactic nuclei selected by different techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assemble a sample of 733 dwarf galaxies ($M_{\ast} \le 10^{9.5} \text{M}_\odot$) with signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and explore the intersection between different AGN selection techniques. Objects in our database are compiled from previous studies that identify AGN in dwarf galaxies through spectroscopy, X-ray emission, infrared colors, and optical photometric variability. We apply a uniform set of AGN diagnostic tools to the database using archival data. We find that any single selection method captures no more than half of the overall AGN population, and there is a general disagreement amongst the AGN selection methods in this stellar mass regime. The largest overlap between methods is found when both methods use optical spectroscopic data. In contrast, the populations of AGN intersect the least when comparing those methods that use photometric data at different wavelengths. These results can be used to better constrain the active fraction in dwarf galaxies, which is in turn an important constraint for black hole seed formation models. In a follow-up paper, we will explore links between the effectiveness of each selection technique and host galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>The COS-Holes Survey: Connecting Galaxy Black Hole Mass with the State of the CGM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of \textit{HST}/COS/G160M observations of CIV in the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a novel sample of eight z$\sim$0, L$\approx$L$^{\star}$ galaxies, paired with UV-bright QSOs at impact parameters ($R_\mathrm{proj}$) between 25-130 kpc. The galaxies in this stellar-mass-controlled sample (log$_{10}$M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\sim$ 10.2-10.9 M$_{\odot}$) host super-massive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically-measured masses spanning log$_{10}$M$_\mathrm{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\sim$ 6.8-8.4; this allows us to compare our results with models of galaxy formation where the integrated feedback history from the SMBH alters the CGM over long timescales. We find that the \ion{C}{IV} column density measurements (N$_{\rm C IV}$) (average log$_{10}$N$_{\rm C IV, CH}$ = 13.94$\pm$0.09 cm$^{-2}$) are largely consistent with existing measurements from other surveys of N$_{\rm C IV}$ in the CGM (average log$_{10}$N$_{\rm C IV, Lit}$ = 13.90$\pm$0.08 cm$^{-2}$), but do not show obvious variation as a function of the SMBH mass. In contrast, specific star-formation rate (sSFR) is highly correlated with the ionized content of the CGM. We find a large spread in sSFR for galaxies with log$_{10}$M$_\mathrm{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$ $&gt;$ 7.0, where the CGM \ion{C}{IV} content shows clear dependence on galaxy sSFR but not M$_\mathrm{BH}$. Our results do not indicate an obvious causal link between CGM CIV and the mass of the galaxy's SMBH; however through comparisons to the EAGLE, Romulus25, $\&amp;$ IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that our sample is likely too small to constrain such causality.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Disentangling for Spectroscopic Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A suite of spectroscopic surveys is producing vast sets of stellar spectra with the goal of advancing stellar physics and Galactic evolution by determining their basic physical properties. A substantial fraction of these stars are in binary systems, but almost all large-survey modeling pipelines treat them as single stars. For sets of multi-epoch spectra, spectral disentangling is a powerful technique to recover or constrain the individual components' spectra of a multiple system. So far, this approach has focused on small samples or individual objects, usually with high resolution ($R \gtrsim 10.000$) spectra and many epochs ($\gtrsim 8$). Here, we present a disentangling implementation that accounts for several aspects of few-epoch spectra from large surveys: that vast sample sizes require automatic determination of starting guesses; that some of the most extensive spectroscopic surveys have a resolution of only $\approx 2,000$; that few epochs preclude unique orbit fitting; that one needs effective regularisation of the disentangled solution to ensure resulting spectra are smooth. We describe the implementation of this code and show with simulated spectra how well spectral recovery can work for hot and cool stars at $R \approx 2000$. Moreover, we verify the code on two established binary systems, the ``Unicorn'' and ``Giraffe''. This code can serve to explore new regimes in survey disentangling in search of massive stars with massive dark companions, e.g. the $\gtrsim 200,000$ hot stars of the SDSS-V survey.</description>

      <title>Quasars can Signpost Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in the centers of massive galaxies, and galaxy mergers should eventually lead to SMBH mergers. Quasar activity has long been associated with galaxy mergers, so here we investigate if supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are preferentially found in quasars. Our multimessenger investigation folds together a gravitational wave background signal from NANOGrav, a sample of periodic AGN candidates from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and a quasar mass function, to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of quasars which could host a SMBHB. We find at 95\% confidence that quasars are at most seven times as likely to host a SMBHB as a random galaxy. Quasars should therefore be prioritized as targets for SMBHB searches in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>The backreaction of stellar wobbling on accretion discs of massive protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been demonstrated that massive stars see their infant circumstellar medium shaped into a large, irradiated, gravitationally unstable accretion disc during their early formation phase. Such discs constitute the gas reservoir in which nascent high-mass stars gain substantial fraction of their mass by episodic accretion of dense gaseous circumstellar clumps. We aim to evaluate the effects of stellar motion, caused by the disc non-axisymmetric gravitational field, on the disc evolution and its spatial morphology. In particular, we analyze the disc propensity to gravitational instability and fragmentation, and also disc appearance on synthetic millimeter-band images pertinent to the alma facility. We employed three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the surroundings of a young massive star in the non-inertial spherical coordinate system, adopting the highest spatial resolution to date and including the indirect star-disc gravitational potential caused by the asymmetries in the circumstellar disc. The resulting disc were postprocessed with the radiation transfer tool RADMC-3D and CASA softwear to obtain disc synthetic images. The redistribution of angular momentum in the system makes the disc smaller and rounder, reduces the number of circumstellar gaseous clumps formed via disc gravitational fragmentation, and prevents the ejection of gaseous clumps from the disc. The synthetic predictive images at millimeter wavelengths of the accretion disc including stellar wobbling are in better agreement with the observations of the surroundings of massive young stellar objects, namely, AFGL 4176 mm1, G17.64+0.16 and G353.273, than our numerical hydrodynamics simulations omitting this physical mechanism. Our work confirms that stellar wobbling is an essential ingredient to account for in numerical simulations of accretion discs of massive protostars.</description>

      <title>Multi-line study of the radial extent of SiO, CS, and SiS in AGB envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of molecules in AGB circumstellar envelopes is regulated by different processes. In the outer layers all molecules are destroyed due to the interaction with interstellar ultraviolet photons. Here we aim to characterize in a coherent and uniform way the radial extent of three molecules (SiO, CS, and SiS) in envelopes around AGB stars of O- and C-rich character, and to study their dependence with mass loss rate. To that purpose, we used the Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m telescopes to observe 7 M-type and 7 C-type AGB envelopes covering a wide range of mass loss rates (1e-7 - 1e-5 Msun/yr) in lines of SiO, CS, and SiS spanning a range of upper level energies of 2-130 K. We carried out excitation and radiative transfer calculations over a wide parameter space to characterize the molecular abundance and radial extent. A chi2 analysis indicates that the abundance is well constrained while the radial extent is more difficult to constrain. The radial extent increases with increasing envelope density, in agreement with previous observational findings. At high envelope densities, Mdot/vexp &gt; 1e-6 (Msun/yr)/(km/s), the radial extent of SiO, CS, and SiS are similar, while at low envelope densities, Mdot/vexp &lt; 1e-7 (Msun/yr)/(km/s), the radial extent differ among the three molecules, in agreement with theoretical expectations based on destruction due to photodissociation. At low envelope densities we find a sequence of increasing radial extent, SiS -&gt; CS -&gt; SiO. We also find a tentative dependence of the radial extent with the chemical type (O- or C-rich) of the star for SiO and CS. Interferometric observations and further investigation of the photodissociation of SiO, CS, and SiS should allow to clarify the situation on the relative photodissociation radius of SiO, CS, and SiS in AGB envelopes and the dependence with envelope density and C/O ratio.</description>

Abstract: Studies of the magnetic characteristics of massive stars have recently received significant attention because they are progenitors of highly magnetised compact objects. Stars initially more massive than about 8M_sun leave behind neutron stars and black holes by the end of their evolution. The merging of binary compact remnant systems produces astrophysical transients detectable by gravitational wave observatories. Studies of magnetic fields in massive stars with low metallicities are of particular interest because they provide important information on the role of magnetic fields in the star formation of the early Universe. While several detections of massive Galactic magnetic stars have been reported in the last few decades, the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the occurrence and strength of stellar magnetic fields has not yet been explored. Because of the similarity between Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and Galactic magnetic Of?p stars, which possess globally organised magnetic fields, we searched for magnetic fields in Of?p stars in the MCs. Additionally, we observed the massive contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to test the theoretical scenario that the origin of magnetic fields involves a merger event or a common envelope evolution. We obtained and analysed measurements of the magnetic field in four massive Of?p stars in the MCs and the binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 using the ESO/VLT FORS2 spectrograph in spectropolarimetric mode. We detected kilogauss-scale magnetic fields in two Of?p-type stars and in the contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7. These results suggest that the impact of low metallicity on the occurrence and strength of magnetic fields in massive stars is low. However, because the explored stellar sample is very small, additional observations of massive stars in the MCs are necessary.</description>

      <title>The key science drivers for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-mm and mm wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities: Where are all the baryons? How do structures interact with their environments? What does the time-varying (sub-)mm sky look like? In order to make major advances on these questions and others, what is needed now is a facility capable of rapidly mapping the sky spatially, spectrally, and temporally, which can only be done by a high throughput, single-dish observatory. An extensive design study for this new facility is currently being undertaken. In this paper, we focus on the key science drivers and the requirements they place on the observatory. As a 50m single dish telescope with a 1-2{\deg} field of view, the strength of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) is in science where a large field of view, highly multiplexed instrumentation and sensitivity to faint large-scale structure is important. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned telescopes.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes and very high-energy neutrinos: the case of NGC 1068</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-messenger study of NGC 1068, the prototype Seyfert II galaxy recently associated with high-energy IceCube neutrinos. Various aspects of the source, including its nuclear activity, jet, outflow, and starburst region, are analyzed in detail using a multi-wavelength approach and relevant luminosities are derived. We then explore its gamma-ray and neutrino emissions and investigate potential mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations with the different astrophysical components to try to understand which one is responsible for the IceCube neutrinos. By first using simple order-of-magnitude arguments and then applying specific theoretical models, we infer that only the region close to the accretion disc around the supermassive black hole has both the right density of X-ray photons needed to provide the targets for protons to sustain neutrino production and of optical/infrared photons required to absorb the associated but unobserved gamma rays. We conclude by highlighting ongoing efforts to constrain a possible broad connection between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei, as well as future synergies between astronomical and neutrino facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As it collapses to form a halo, the shape of a protohalo patch is deformed by the initial shear field. This deformation is often modeled using the "deformation" tensor, constructed from second derivatives of the gravitational potential, whose trace gives the initial overdensity. However, especially for lower mass protohalos, this matrix is not always positive definite: one of its eigenvalues has a different sign from the others. We show that the evolution of a patch is better described by the "energy shear" tensor, which is positive definite and plays a direct role in the evolution. This positive-definiteness simplifies models of halo abundances, assembly and of the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Filter Design for Estimation of Stellar Metallicity: Insights from Experiments with Gaia XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for an optimal filter design for the estimation of stellar metallicity, based on synthetic photometry from Gaia XP spectra convolved with a series of filter-transmission curves defined by different central wavelengths and bandwidths. Unlike previous designs based solely on maximizing metallicity sensitivity, we find that the optimal solution provides a balance between the sensitivity and uncertainty of the spectra. With this optimal filter design, the best precision of metallicity estimates for relatively bright ($G \sim 11.5$) stars is excellent, $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.034$\,dex for FGK dwarf stars, superior to that obtained utilizing custom sensitivity-optimized filters (e.g., SkyMapper\,$v$). By selecting hundreds of high-probabability member stars of the open cluster M67, our analysis reveals that the intrinsic photometric-metallicity scatter of these cluster members is only 0.036\,dex, consistent with this level of precision. Our results clearly demonstrate that the internal precision of photometric-metallicity estimates can be extremely high, even providing the opportunity to perform chemical tagging for very large numbers of field stars in the Milky Way. This experiment shows that it is crucial to take into account uncertainty alongside the sensitivity when designing filters for measuring the stellar metallicity and other parameters.</description>

      <title>WIYN Open Cluster Study. XC. Barium Surface Abundances of Blue Straggler Stars in the Open Clusters NGC 7789 and M67</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate barium (Ba) abundances in blue straggler stars (BSSs) in two open clusters, NGC 7789 (1.6 Gyr) and M67 (4 Gyr), as signatures of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) mass transfer. We combine our findings with previous Ba abundance analyses in NGC 6819 (2.5 Gyr) and NGC 188 (7 Gyr). Out of 35 BSSs studied in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, 15 (43$\pm$11%) are Ba-enriched; no BSSs in NGC 188 are Ba-enriched. The Ba abundances of enriched BSSs show an anticorrelation with cluster age, ranging from an enrichment of [Ba/Fe]$\sim$+1.5 dex in NGC 7789 to [Ba/Fe]$\sim$+1.0 dex in M67. The Ba-enriched BSSs all lie in the same region of the HR diagram, irrespective of cluster age or distance from the main-sequence turnoff. Our data suggest a link between AGB donor mass and mass-transfer efficiency in BSSs, in that less massive AGB donors tend to undergo more conservative mass transfer. We find that 40$\pm$16% of the Ba-enriched BSSs are in longer-period spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods less than 5000 days. Those Ba-enriched BSSs that do not exhibit radial-velocity variability suggest AGB mass-transfer in wide binaries by either wind mass transfer or wind Roche-lobe overflow. Given the preponderance of long orbital periods in the BSSs of M67 and NGC 188 and the frequency of Ba enrichment in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, it may be that AGB mass transfer is the dominant mechanism of BSS formation in open clusters older than 1 Gyr.</description>

      <title>An Expanding Accretion Disk and a Warm Disk Wind As Seen In the Spectral Evolution of HBC 722</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the post-outburst evolution of the FU Ori object HBC 722 in optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. Using a modified viscous accretion disk model, we fit the outburst epoch SED to determine the physical parameters of the disk, including $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} = 10^{-4.0} \ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $R_\mathrm{inner} = 3.65 \ R_\odot$, $i = 79^\circ$, and a maximum disk temperature of $T_\mathrm{max} = 5700$ K. We then use a decade of optical/NIR spectra to demonstrate a changing accretion rate drives the visible-range photometric variation, while the NIR shows the outer radius of the active accretion disk expands outward as the outburst progresses. We also identify the major components of the disk system: a plane-parallel disk atmosphere in Keplerian rotation and a 2-part warm disk wind that is collimated near the star and wide-angle at larger radii. The wind is traced by classic wind lines, and appears as a narrow, low-velocity, deep absorption component in several atomic lines spanning the visible spectrum and in the CO 2.29$\mu$m band. We compare the wind lines to those computed from wind models for other FU Ori systems and rapidly accreting young stellar disks and find a 4000-6000 K wind can explain the observed line profiles. Fitting the progenitor spectrum, we find $M_* = 0.2 \ M_\odot$ and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{progenitor} = 7.8 \times 10^{-8} \ M_\odot \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we discuss HBC 722 relative to V960 Mon, another FU Ori object we have previously studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Discovery of giant radio sources from TGSS ADR 1: radio, optical, and infrared properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant radio sources (GRSs) are the single largest astrophysical objects known in the universe that have grown to megaparsec scales ($\ge$ 0.7 Mpc). GRSs are much rarer compared with normal-sized radio galaxies. Still, the reason for the formation of their gigantic sizes is under debate. We systematically search for GRSs from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey Alternative Data Release 1 (TGSS ADR 1) at 150 MHz. We have newly identified 34 GRSs from this study. We have also studied the multi-wavelength properties (radio, optical, and infrared) of these GRSs. We have used the likelihood ratio method to identify highly reliable multi-wavelength counterparts of GRSs from Pan-STARRS (optical) and WISE (mid-IR) data. We have classified GRSs based on their accretion mode of the central black holes using optical and mid-IR data. For all sources, we also discuss the principal characteristic parameters (redshift distribution, angular and projected linear size, total integrated radio flux density, spectral index, and radio power). We show the radio evolution track and the location of the GRSs in the P-D diagram. Using a radio-optical luminosity diagram, we identify GRSs in the Fanaroff-Riley classification. Only two GRGs in our sample reside close to the centres of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Halo Densities and Pericenter Distances of the Bright Milky Way Satellites as a Test of Dark Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new constraints on the dark matter halo density profile of Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using the phase-space distribution function (DF) method. After assessing the systematics of the approach against mock data from the Gaia Challenge project, we apply the DF analysis to the entire kinematic sample of well-measured MW dwarf satellites for the first time. Contrary to previous findings for some of these objects, we find that the DF analysis yields results consistent with the standard Jeans analysis. In particular, in the present study we rediscover: i) a large diversity in the inner halo densities of dSphs (bracketed by Draco and Fornax), and ii) an anti-correlation between inner halo density and pericenter distance of the bright MW satellites. Regardless of the strength of the anti-correlation, we find that the distribution of these satellites in density vs. pericenter space is inconsistent with the results of the high-res N-body simulations that include a disk potential. Our analysis motivates further studies on the role of internal feedback and dark matter microphysics in these dSphs.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: I. The growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model for galaxy formation and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), based on the fact that cold dark matter (CDM) halos form their gravitational potential wells through a fast phase with rapid change in the potential, and that the high universal baryon fraction makes cooled gas in halos self-gravitating and turbulent before it can form rotation-supported disks. Gas fragmentation produces sub-clouds so dense that cloud-cloud collision and drag on clouds are not significant, producing a dynamically hot system of sub-clouds that form stars and move ballistically to feed the central SMBH. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) and supernova (SN) feedback is effective only in the fast phase, and the cumulative effects are to regulate star formation and SMBH growth, as well as to reduce the amount of cold gas in halos to allow the formation of globally stable disks. Using a set of halo assembly histories, we demonstrate that the model can reproduce a number of observations, including correlations among SMBH mass, stellar mass of galaxies and halo mass, the number densities of galaxies and SMBH, as well as their evolution over the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The impact of environment on size: Galaxies are 50% smaller in the Fornax Cluster compared to the field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Size is a fundamental parameter for measuring the growth of galaxies and the role of the environment on their evolution. However, the conventional size definitions used for this purpose are often biased and miss the diffuse, outermost signatures of galaxy growth, including star formation and gas accretion. This issue is addressed by examining low surface brightness truncations or galaxy ``edges'' as a physically motivated tracer of size based on star formation thresholds. Our total sample consists of $\sim900$ galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^5 M_{\odot} &lt; M_{\star} &lt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. This sample of nearby cluster, group satellite and nearly isolated field galaxies was compiled using multi-band imaging from the Fornax Deep Survey, deep IAC Stripe 82 and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Surveys. We find that the edge radii scale as $R_{\rm edge} \propto M_{\star}^{0.42}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter ($\sim 0.07$ dex). The scatter is driven by the morphology and environment of galaxies. In both the cluster and field, early-type dwarfs are systematically smaller by $\sim20\%$ than the late-types. However, compared to the field galaxies in the Fornax cluster are the most impacted. At a fixed stellar mass, edges in the cluster can be found at $\sim$ 50\% smaller radii and the average stellar surface density at the edges is a factor of two higher $\sim 1\,M_{\odot}$/pc$^2$. Our findings support the rapid removal of loosely bound neutral hydrogen in hot, crowded environments which truncates galaxies outside-in earlier, preventing the formation of more extended sizes and lower density edges. Our results highlight the importance of deep imaging surveys to study the low surface brightness imprints of the large scale structure and environment on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>THEMIS 2.0: A self-consistent model for dust extinction, emission, and polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations in emission, extinction, and polarisation have at least partially invalidated most of the astronomical standard grain models for the diffuse ISM. Moreover, lab measurements on interstellar silicate analogues have shown differences with the optical properties used in these standard models. To address these issues, our objective is twofold: (i) to update the optical properties of silicates and (ii) to develop the THEMIS dust model to allow the calculation of polarised extinction and emission. Based on optical constants measured in the lab for amorphous silicates and on observational constraints in mid-IR extinction and X-ray scattering, we defined new optical constants for the THEMIS silicates. Absorption and scattering efficiencies for spheroidal grains were then derived with the discrete dipole approximation. These new optical properties make it possible to explain the dust emission and extinction, both total and polarised. The model is not yet pushed to its limits since it does not require the perfect alignment of all grains to explain the observations and it therefore has the potential to accommodate the highest polarisation levels inferred from extinction measures. Moreover, the dispersion of the optical properties of the different lab silicates naturally explain the variations in both the total and polarised emission and extinction observed in the diffuse ISM. A single, invariant model calibrated on one single set of observations is obsolete for explaining contemporary observations. We are proposing a completely flexible dust model based entirely on lab measurements that has the potential to make major advances in understanding the nature of ISM grains and how they evolve as a function of their environment. Even if challenging, this is also relevant for future missions that will aim to perform precise measurements of the CMB spectral distortions and polarisation.</description>

      <title>Do galaxy mergers prefer under-dense environments?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in galaxy evolution. However, the correlation between mergers and the local environment of galaxies is not fully understood. We aim to address the question of whether galaxy mergers prefer denser or less dense environments by quantifying the spatial clustering of mergers and non-mergers. We use two different indicators to classify mergers and non-mergers - classification based on a deep learning technique ($f$) and non-parametric measures of galaxy morphology, Gini-$M_{20}$ ($g$). We used a set of galaxy samples in the redshift range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.15$ from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey with a stellar mass cut of $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot} ) &gt; 9.5$. We measured and compared the two-point correlation function (2pCF) of mergers and non-mergers classified using the two merger indicators $f$ and $g$. We measured the marked correlation function (MCF), in which the galaxies are weighted by $f$ to probe the environmental dependence of galaxy mergers. We do not observe a statistically significant difference between the clustering strengths of mergers and non-mergers obtained using 2pCF. However, using the MCF measurements with $f$ as a mark, we observe an anti-correlation between the likelihood of a galaxy being a merger and its environment. Our results emphasise the advantage of MCF over 2pCF in probing the environmental correlations. Based on the MCF measurements, we conclude that the galaxy mergers prefer to occur in the under-dense environments on scales $&gt; 50 \, h^{-1} \mathrm{kpc}$ of the large-scale structure (LSS). We attribute this observation to the high relative velocities of galaxies in the densest environments that prevent them from merging.</description>

Abstract: Clusters and their progenitors (protoclusters) at z = 2-4, the peak epoch of star formation, are ideal laboratories to study the formation process of both the clusters themselves and their member galaxies. However, a complete census of their member galaxies has been challenging due to observational difficulties. Here we present new JWST/NIRCam observations targeting the distant cluster CLJ1001 at z = 2.51 from the COSMOS-Web program, which, in combination with previous narrowband imaging targeting H-alpha emitters and deep millimeter surveys of CO emitters, provide a complete view of massive galaxy assembly in CLJ1001. In particular, JWST reveals a population of massive, extremely red cluster members in the long-wavelength bands that were invisible in previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/F160W imaging (HST-dark members). Based on this highly complete spectroscopic sample of member galaxies, we show that the spatial distribution of galaxies in CLJ1001 exhibits a strong central concentration, with the central galaxy density already resembling that of low-z clusters. Moreover, we reveal a "top-heavy" stellar mass function for the star-forming galaxies (SFGs), with an overabundance of massive SFGs piled up in the cluster core. These features strongly suggest that CLJ1001 is caught in a rapid transition, with many of its massive SFGs likely soon becoming quiescent. In the context of cluster formation, these findings suggest that the earliest clusters form from the inside out and top to bottom, with the massive galaxies in the core assembling first, followed by the less massive ones in the outskirts.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in AGN Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the 3D dust radiative transfer code SKIRT to the low-redshift ($z\leq0.1$) galaxy population in the TNG100 cosmological simulation, the fiducial run of the IllustrisTNG project. We compute global fluxes and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far-ultraviolet to the sub-millimeter for $\approx\,$60 000 galaxies. Our post-processing methodology follows the study of Tr\v{c}ka et al. (2022) of the higher-resolution TNG50 simulation. We verify that TNG100 reproduces observational luminosity functions at low redshifts to excellent precision, unlike TNG50. Additionally, we test the realism of our TNG100 plus SKIRT fluxes by comparing various flux and color relations to data from the GAMA survey. TNG100 broadly reproduces the observed distributions, but we predict ultraviolet colors that are too blue by $\approx\,$0.4 mag, possibly related to the extinction in the star-forming regions subgrid model not being selective enough. Furthermore, we find that the simulated galaxies exhibit mid-infrared fluxes elevated by up to $\approx\,$0.5 mag that we attribute to overly effective stochastic heating of the diffuse dust. All synthetic broadband fluxes and SEDs are made publicly available in three orientations and four apertures, and can readily be used to study TNG100 galaxies in a mock observational fashion.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the gas-grain relative drift velocity distributions of charged astrophysical dust grains in MHD turbulence. We do this using a range of MHD-PIC simulations spanning different plasma-$\beta$, sonic/Alfv\'en Mach number, and with grains of varying size and charge-to-mass ratio. We find that the root-mean-square drift velocity is a strong function of the grain size, following a power law with a 1/2 slope. The r.m.s. value has only a very weak dependence on the charge-to-mass ratio. On the other hand, the shape of the distribution is a strong function of the grain charge-to-mass ratio, and in compressible turbulence, also the grain size. We then compare these results to simple analytic models based upon time-domain quasi-linear theory and solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. These models explain qualitatively the r.m.s. drift velocity's lack of charge-to-mass ratio dependence, as well as why the shape of the distribution changes as the charge-to-mass ratio increases. Finally we scale our results to astrophysical conditions. As an example, at a length scale of one parsec in the cold neutral medium, 0.1 $\mu$m grains should be drifting at roughly 40% of the turbulent velocity dispersion. These findings may serve as a basis for a model for grain velocities in the context of grain-grain collisions, non-thermal sputtering, and accretion of metals. These findings also have implications for the transport of grains through the galaxy, suggesting that grains may have non-negligible random motions at length-scales that many modern galaxy simulations approach.</description>

      <title>Gaia22dkvLb: A Microlensing Planet Potentially Accessible to Radial-Velocity Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03944</link>

Abstract: We report discovering an exoplanet from following up a microlensing event alerted by Gaia. The event Gaia22dkv is toward a disk source rather than the traditional bulge microlensing fields. Our primary analysis yields a Jovian planet with M_p = 0.59^{+0.15}_{-0.05} M_J at a projected orbital separation r_perp = 1.4^{+0.8}_{-0.3} AU, and the host is a ~1.1 M_sun turnoff star at ~1.3 kpc. At r'~14, the host is far brighter than any previously discovered microlensing planet host, opening up the opportunity of testing the microlensing model with radial velocity (RV) observations. RV data can be used to measure the planet's orbital period and eccentricity, and they also enable searching for inner planets of the microlensing cold Jupiter, as expected from the ''inner-outer correlation'' inferred from Kepler and RV discoveries. Furthermore, we show that Gaia astrometric microlensing will not only allow precise measurements of its angular Einstein radius theta_E, but also directly measure the microlens parallax vector and unambiguously break a geometric light-curve degeneracy, leading to definitive characterization of the lens system.</description>

      <title>PNG-UNITsims: Halo clustering response to primordial non-Gaussianities as a function of mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the largest full N-body simulation to date with local primordial non-Gaussianities (L-PNG), the \textsc{PNG-UNITsim}. It tracks the evolution of $4096^3$ particles within a periodic box with $L_{\rm box} = 1 \; h^{-1}\,{\rm Gpc}$, leading to a mass resolution of $m_{p} = 1.24\times 10^{9}\; h^{-1}\,M_\odot$. This is enough to resolve galaxies targeted by stage-IV spectroscopic surveys. The \textsc{PNG-UNIT} has \textit{Fixed} initial conditions whose phases are also \textit{Matched} to the pre-existing \textsc{UNIT} simulation. These two features in the simulations reduce our uncertainty significantly so we use 100 \textsc{FastPM} mocks to estimate this reduction. The amplitude of the non-Gaussianities used to set the initial conditions of this new simulation is $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local} = 100$. In this first study, we use mass selected dark matter haloes from the \textsc{PNG-UNIT} simulation to constrain the local PNG parameters. PNG induce a scale dependent bias, parameterised through \bp or $p$, which might depend on the type of cosmological tracer. Those cases when $p=1$ are referred to as the {\it universality relation}. We measure $p$ as a function of the halo mass. Haloes with masses between $1\times 10^{12}$ and $2\times 10^{13} \, h^{-1} M_\odot$ are well described by the {\it universality relation}. For haloes with masses between $2\times 10^{10}$ and $1\times 10^{12} \, h^{-1} M_\odot$ we find that $p&lt;1$ at $3\sigma$. Combining all the mass bins, we find $p$ consistent with a value of $0.955\pm0.013$, which is $3\sigma$ away from \textit{universality}, as low mass haloes are more numerous. We also study the effect of using priors on $p$ when constraining $f_{\rm NL}$. Using the values we obtain for $b_\phi$ as priors, we forecast that a DESI-like (stage-IV) survey will be able to constrain $f_{\rm NL}$ better than if the universality relation is assumed.</description>

      <title>A Contact Binary Mis-Classified as an Ellipsoidal Variable: Complications for Detached Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying sources exhibiting ellipsoidal variability in large photometric surveys is becoming a promising method to search for candidate detached black holes in binaries. This technique aims to exploit the orbital-phase dependent modulation in optical photometry caused by the black hole distorting the shape of the luminous star to constrain the mass ratio of the binary. Without understanding if, or how much, contamination is present in the candidate black hole samples produced by this new technique it is hard to leverage them for black hole discovery. Here, we follow up one of the best candidates identified from Gaia Data Release 3, Gaia DR3 4042390512917208960, with a radial velocity campaign. Combined photometric and radial velocity modelling, along with spectral disentangling, suggests that the true mass ratio (mass of the unseen object divided by the mass of the luminous star) is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred assuming the modulations arise from ellipsoidal variability. We therefore infer that this system is likely a contact binary, or on the boundary of both stars nearly filling their Roche lobes, however, further observations are required to confidently detect the secondary. We find that the well-known problem of discriminating between ellipsoidal and contact binary light curves results in a larger contamination from contact binaries than previously suggested. Until ellipsoidal variables can be reliably distinguished from contact binaries, samples of black hole candidates selected based on ellipsoidal variability are likely to be highly contaminated by contact binaries or similar systems.</description>
