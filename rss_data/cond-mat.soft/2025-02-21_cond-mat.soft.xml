      <title>Nearly Complete Segregation of Submerged Grains in a Rotating Drum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-driven segregations, extensively studied in a simple rotating drum, are enriched with a wide range of underlying physics. Diverse symmetrical segregation patterns formed by mixing two types of dry mono-sized grains have been revealed due to variations in heavy and light grain densities, $\rho_h$ and $\rho_l$, and rotating speeds, $\omega$. We engender experimentally a nearly complete segregation, not occurring in dry conditions of the same $\rho_h$, $\rho_l$, and $\omega$, in submerged states. Further, based on the experiment-validated simulations, using coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method, it is found the mixing index can be well predicted over a wide parameter space in the effective density ratio, $D=(\rho_h-\rho_f)/(\rho_l-\rho_f)$ with $\rho_f$ being the fluid density. Specifically, with increasing $D$ well-mixed states transit to fully-segregated states with a rising number of vortices and severer asymmetrical patterns. When the global Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}_g$ is enlarged, the vortex area of heavy particles shrinks for lower $D$, while the area of light particles gradually saturates; meanwhile, for higher $D$ a new vortex with a continuously expanded area can be encountered in the light particle zone. These results improve our understanding of segregation transitions especially in submerged granular systems and shed new light on various science and engineering practices.</description>

      <title>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic heterogeneity in biomolecular condensates from sequence patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates composed of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are vital for proper cellular function, and their dysfunction is associated with diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. Despite their biological importance, the precise physical mechanisms underlying condensate (dys)function are unclear, in part owing to the difficulties in understanding how biomolecular sequence patterns influence emergent condensate behaviours across relevant length and timescales. Here, through minimal physical modelling, we explain how IDP sequence patterning gives rise to nano-scale organisational heterogeneities in condensates. By applying our coarse-grained molecular-dynamics polymer model, which accounts for steric, attractive, and electrostatic interactions, we systematically quantify and map out the emergent morphological phases resulting from a wide range of sequence patterns. We demonstrate how sequences that enable local coil-to-globule transitions within regions of single polymers - driven by a competition between the preferred crowding densities of different regions in the sequence - also exhibit cluster formation in condensates. Overall, our work provides a conceptual framework to understand how sequence properties determine mesoscopic organisation within biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Diffusive evaporation dynamics in polymer solutions is ubiquitous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theory and experiments have shown how the buildup of a high-concentration polymer layer at a one-dimensional solvent-air interface can lead to an evaporation rate that scales with time as $t^{-1/2}$ and that is insensitive to the ambient humidity. Using phase field modelling we show that this scaling law constitutes a naturally emerging robust regime, Diffusion-Limited Evaporation (DLE). This regime dominates the dynamical state diagram of the system, which also contains regions of constant and arrested evaporation, confirming and extending understanding of recent experimental observations and theoretical predictions. We provide a theoretical argument to show that the scaling observed in the DLE regime occurs for a wide range of parameters, and our simulations predict that it can occur in two-dimensional geometries as well. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to more complex systems.</description>

      <title>$NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When energy polydispersity is introduced into the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, there is little effect on structure and dynamics [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point both the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by even large energy polydispersity, which is in stark contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue -- and validate by simulations of up to 30\% polydispersity -- that this almost invariance of structure and dynamics reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. Because $NVU$ dynamics defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same physics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as of the standard single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is significantly affected by introducing size polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Dewetting Fingering Instability in Capillary Suspensions: Role of Particles and Liquid Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the fingering instability that forms during stretching of capillary suspensions with and without added nanoparticles. The dewetting process is observed using a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell. The liquid bridge is stretched under constant acceleration, and the resulting instability patterns are recorded using two high-speed cameras. Finger-like structures, characteristic of the Saffman-Taylor instability are observed. The total length of the dendrites and the intersecting number of branches are quantified. We reveal the roles of microparticles, nanoparticles, and the secondary liquid during the fingering instability. The addition of microparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger length due to increased particle interactions and nucleation sites for bubbles. The addition of secondary fluid reduces fingering length by forming a strong interparticle network. Incorporation of nanoparticles induces an early onset of cavitation and enhances fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make the capillary suspensions' overall microstructure more homogeneous, reduce the sample variation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution of gel on both slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complex interactions governing dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions. This knowledge has potential applications in microfluidics, 3D printing, and thin-film coatings, where controlling dewetting is crucial.</description>

      <title>Why epithelial cells collectively move against a traveling signal wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of cell populations to external stimuli plays a central role in biological mechanical processes such as epithelial wound healing and developmental morphogenesis. Wave-like propagation of a signal of ERK MAP kinase has been shown to direct collective migration in one direction; however, the mechanism based on continuum mechanics under a traveling wave is not fully understood. To elucidate how the traveling wave of the ERK kinase signal directs collective migration, we constructed the mechanical model of the epithelial cell monolayer by considering the signal-dependent coordination of contractile stress and cellular orientation. The proposed model was studied by using an optogenetically-controlled cell system where we found that local signal activation induces changes in cell density and orientation with the direction of propagation. The net motion of the cell population occurred relative to the wave, and the migration velocity showed a maximum in resonance with the velocity of the ERK signal wave. The presented mechanical model was further validated in \textit{in vitro} wound healing process.</description>

      <title>Limits to positional information in boundary-driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical gradients can be used by a particle to determine its position. This \textit{positional information} is of crucial importance, for example in developmental biology in the formation of patterns in an embryo. The central goal of this paper is to study the fundamental physical limits on how much positional information can be stored inside a system. To achieve this, we study positional information for general boundary-driven systems, and derive, in the near-equilibrium regime, a universal expression involving only the chemical potential and density gradients of the system. We also conjecture that this expression serves as an upper bound on the positional information of boundary driven systems beyond linear response. To support this claim, we test it on a broad range of solvable boundary-driven systems.</description>
