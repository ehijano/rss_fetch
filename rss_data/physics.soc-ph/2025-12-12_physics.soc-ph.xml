      <title>Techno-Economic Assessment of Wind-Powered Green Hydrogen Production for US Industrial Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of supplying industrial thermal loads with green hydrogen produced via water electrolysis using two pathways off-grid systems powered by co-located wind turbines and battery energy storage (BESS), and on-grid systems that procure electricity directly from the wind farm power node and operate electrolysers in response to real-time locational marginal prices (LMPs).The optimization results show that off-grid wind-to-hydrogen configurations in high-resource regions can achieve levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH) on the order of \$7/kg, driven by high wind capacity factors and optimized BESS sizing that ensures operational continuity .Similarly in, on-grid, price-responsive operation achieves LCOH values of \$0.5/kg, reflecting sensitivity to electricity market volatility. Overall, the results suggest that Midwest wind-rich regions can support competitive green hydrogen production for industrial heat, with grid-connected electrolysers remaining attractive in locations with frequent low LMP periods. This dual-path analysis provides a transparent framework for industrial hydrogen deployment and highlights practical transition strategies for decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Coupling opinion dynamics and epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the coupled dynamics of behavior and infectious disease using a mathematical model. We integrate a two-state q-voter opinion process with SIS-type infection dynamics, where transmission rates are influenced by the opinion and an infection-induced switching mechanism represents individuals reassessing their behav- ior upon infection. Analytically, we derive conditions for the stability of endemic and disease-free equilibria. Numerical simulations reveal complex dynamics: above a certain infectivity threshold, the system can exhibit alternative basins of attraction leading to a balanced endemic fixed point or stable limit cycles. Notably, the dominant asymptotic opinion and resulting epidemiological outcomes show non-monotonic relationships with infectivity, highlighting the potential for adaptive behavior to induce complex system dynamics. These findings underscore the critical role of social interventions; shifts in behavioral norms and trust can permanently alter epidemic outcomes, suggesting that such interventions are as crucial as biomedical controls</description>

      <title>The Physics of Sustainability: Material and Power Constraints for the Long Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of today's sustainability discourse emphasizes efficiency, clean technologies, and smart systems, but largely underestimates fundamental physical constraints relating to energy-matter interactions. These constraints stem from the fact that Earth is a materially closed yet energetically open system, driven by the sustained but low power-density flux of solar radiation. This Perspective reframes sustainability within these axiomatic limits, integrating relevant timescales and orders of magnitude. We argue that fossil-fueled industrial metabolism is inherently incompatible with long-term viability, while post-fossil systems are surface-, materials-, and power-intensive. Long-term sustainability must therefore be defined not only by how much energy or material is used, but also by how it is used: favoring organic, carbon-based chemistry with limited reliance on purified metals, operating at low power density, and maintaining low throughput rates. Achieving this requires radical technological shifts toward life-compatible systems and biogeochemical circular processes, and, likely as a consequence, a paradigm change toward degrowth to a steady-state. These two shifts are mutually reinforcing and together provide the necessary foundation for any viable future.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Byline: Exploring Gender and Authorship Patterns in Canadian Science Publishing Journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canada is internationally recognized for its leadership in science and its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. Despite this leadership, limited research has examined gender disparities in scientific publishing within the Canadian context. This study analyzes over 67,000 articles published in 24 Canadian Science Publishing (CSP) journals between 2010 and 2021 to better understand patterns of gender representation. Findings show that women accounted for less than one-third of published authors across CSP journals. Representation varied by discipline, with higher proportions of women in biomedical sciences and lower proportions of women in engineering - trends that mirror broader national and global patterns. Notably, the proportion of women submitting manuscripts closely matched those published, suggesting that broader workforce disparities may play a larger role than publication bias. Women were less likely to be solo authors or to hold prominent authorship positions, such as first or last author - roles typically associated with research leadership and career advancement. These findings point to the need for a two-fold response: continued efforts to address systemic barriers to women's participation in science, and a review of publishing practices to ensure equitable access, recognition, and inclusion for all researchers.</description>

      <title>The $k$-flip Ising game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A partially parallel dynamical noisy binary choice (Ising) game in discrete time of $N$ players on complete graphs with $k$ players having a possibility of changing their strategies at each time moment called $k$-flip Ising game is considered. Analytical calculation of the transition matrix of game as well as the first two moments of the distribution of $\varphi=N^+/N$, where $N^+$ is a number of players adhering to one of the two strategies, is presented. First two moments of the first hitting time distribution for sample trajectories corresponding to transition from a metastable and unstable states to a stable one are considered. A nontrivial dependence of these moments on $k$ for the decay of a metastable state is discussed. A presence of the minima at certain $k^*$ is attributed to a competition between $k$-dependent diffusion and restoring forces.</description>

      <title>Collective contributions to polarization in political voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Politics around the world exhibits increasing polarization, demonstrated in part by rigid voting configurations in institutions like legislatures or courts. A crux of polarization is separation along a unidimensional ideological axis, but voting behavior is in reality more complex, with other signatures of collective order. We extend a foundational, statistical physics framework, restricted Boltzmann machines, to explain the full complexity of voting. The models we propose are minimal, fit strongly correlated voting data, and have parameters that transparently give vote probabilities. The model accounts for multi-dimensional voter preferences and the context in which such preferences are expressed to disentangle individual from collective contributions; for example, legislative bills can negotiate multiple issues, whose appeals add up or compete for individual votes. With the example of the U.S. Senate, we find that senators have multi-dimensional preferences, and, as one consequence, non-polarized coalitions coexist with polarized ones. Increasing polarization is predominantly explained by fewer votes that elicit bipartisan coalitions. We show that these accounts can be consistent, if far more parsimonious, than interaction-driven order. The findings highlight the collective choice of the content of and the rules of voting in the ebb and flow of polarization.</description>

      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a systematic characterization of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks within the quenched mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>An accurate mean-field equation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the emergent macroscopic behavior of dynamical systems on networks is a crucial but challenging task. One of the simplest and most effective methods to construct a reduced macroscopic model is given by mean-field theory. The resulting approximations perform well on dense and homogeneous networks but poorly on scale-free networks, which, however, are more realistic in many applications. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the mean-field approximation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks. The two main deviations from classical theory are that we use degree-weighted shares as coarse variables and that we introduce a correlation factor that can be interpreted as slowing down dynamics induced by interactions. We observe that the correlation factor is only a property of the network and not of the state or of parameters of the process. This approach achieves a significantly smaller approximation error than standard methods without increasing dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for identifying influential nodes in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes plays a pivotal role in understanding, controlling, and optimizing the behavior of complex systems, ranging from social to biological and technological domains. Yet most centrality-based approaches rely on pairwise topology and are purely structural, neglecting the higher-order interactions and the coupling between structure and dynamics. Consequently, the practical effectiveness of existing approaches remains uncertain when applied to complex spreading processes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified framework, Initial Propagation Score (IPS), to directly embed propagation dynamics into influence assessment on higher-order networks. We analytically derive mechanism-aware influence measures by relating the early-stage dynamics and local topological characteristics to long-term outbreak sizes, and such explicit physical context endows IPS with robustness, transferability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple dynamics and more than 20 real-world hypergraphs show that IPS consistently outperforms other leading baseline centralities. Furthermore, IPS estimates node influence with only local neighborhood information, yielding computational efficiency and scalability to large-scale networks. This work underscores the necessity of considering dynamics for reliable identification of influential nodes and provides a concise principled basis for optimizing interventions in epidemiology, information diffusion, and collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>Bringing together African &amp; European research communities with an inclusive astronomy conference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together African and European academic astronomers. This aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international events (i.e., the typical experience of academics in Western institutions), with those historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge research problems, but with a parallel focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diversity of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may never have attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment throughout. We summarise successes, challenges and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants immediately after the conference, and a discussion of some longer-term impacts, which we identified around 1 year later. We found an overall achievement of our objectives, and multiple longer-term benefits. With this report we provide some key recommendations for groups, from any research field, who may wish to lead similar initiatives.</description>

      <title>Potential Landscapes Reveal Spatiotemporal Structure in Urban Mobility: Hodge Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis of Tokyo Before and During COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility is vital to solving societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Recent advancements in data collection now enable the exploration of dynamic mobility patterns in human flow. However, the vast volume and complexity of mobility data make it difficult to interpret spatiotemporal patterns directly, necessitating effective information reduction. The core challenge is to balance data simplification with information preservation: methods must retain location-specific information about human flows from origins to destinations while reducing the data to a comprehensible level. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework: First, combinatorial Hodge theory is applied to the given origin--destination (OD) matrices with timestamps to construct a set of potential landscapes of human flow, preserving imbalanced trip information between locations. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) expresses the time series of potential landscapes as a linear combination of a few static spatial components, with their coefficients representing temporal variations. The framework systematically decouples the spatial and temporal components of the given data. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal large weight variations during a pandemic, characterized by an overall decline in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and its potential to inform urban planning and public health interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, scientific software has graduated from a hidden side-product to a first-class member of the astrophysics literature. We aim to quantify the activity and impact of software development for astronomy, using a systematic survey. Starting from the Astrophysics Source Code Library and the Journal of Open Source Software, we analyse 3432 public git-based scientific software packages. Paper abstract text analysis suggests seven dominant themes: cosmology, data reduction pipelines, exoplanets, hydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer spectra simulation, statistical inference and galaxies. We present key individual software contributors, their affiliated institutes and countries of high-impact software in astronomy &amp; astrophysics. We consider the number of citations to papers using the software and the number of person-days from their git repositories, as proxies for impact and complexity, respectively. We find that half of the mapped development is through US-affiliated institutes, and a large number of high-impact projects are led by a single person. Our results indicate that there are currently over 200 people active on any given day to improve software in astronomy.</description>
