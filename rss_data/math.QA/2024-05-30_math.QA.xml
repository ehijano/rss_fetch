      <title>Reflections to set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to determine reflections to bijective and non-degenerate solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, by exploring their connections with their derived solutions. This is motivated by a recent description of left non-degenerate solutions in terms of a family of automorphisms of their associated left rack. In some cases, we show that the study of reflections for bijective and non-degenerate solutions can be reduced to those of derived type. Moreover, we extend some results obtained in the literature for reflections of involutive non-degenerate solutions to more arbitrary solutions. Besides, we provide ways for defining reflections for solutions obtained by employing some classical construction techniques of solutions. Finally, we gather some numerical data on reflections for bijective non-degenerate solutions associated with skew braces of small order.</description>

      <title>Skein modules and character varieties of Seifert manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Kauffman bracket skein module of a closed Seifert fibered 3-manifold $M$ is finitely generated over $\mathbb Z[A^{\pm 1}]$ if and only if $M$ is irreducible and non-Haken.
  We analyze in detail the character varieties $X(M)$ of such manifolds and show that under mild conditions they are reduced. We compute the Kauffman bracket skein modules for these $3$-manifolds (over $\mathbb Q(A)$) and show that their dimensions coincide with $|X(M)|.$</description>

      <title>Hecke and Artin monoids and their homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work was motivated by a striking observation that parabolic projections of Hecke monoids map respect all parabolic elements. We found other classes of homomorphisms of Hecke monoids with the same property and discovered that many of them lift to homomorphisms of covering Artin monoids with a similar property. It turned out that they belong to a much larger class (in fact, a category) of homomorphisms of Artin monoids, most of which appear to be new.</description>

      <title>Unitarity of minimal $W$-algebras and their representations II: Ramond sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study unitary Ramond twisted representations of minimal $W$-algebras. We classify all such irreducible highest weight representations with a non-Ramond extremal highest weight (unitarity in the Ramond extremal case, as well as in the untwisted extremal case, remains open). We compute the characters of these representations and deduce from them the denominator identities for all superconformal algebras in the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sector. Some of the results rely on conjectures about the properties of the quantum Hamiltonian reduction functor in the Ramond sector.</description>

      <title>Coinvariants of metaplectic representations on moduli of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct spaces of coinvariants at principally polarized abelian varieties with respect to the action of an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. We show how these spaces globalize to twisted $\mathcal{D}$-modules on moduli of principally polarized abelian varieties, and we determine the Atiyah algebra of a line bundle acting on them. We prove analogous results on the universal abelian variety. An essential aspect of our arguments involves analyzing the Atiyah algebra of the Hodge and canonical line bundles on moduli of abelian varieties and the universal abelian variety.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>
