      <title>Single-walled carbon nanotubes: the Bloch theory, reciprocal tubes, and a tight-binding approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of a graphene sheet is altered when it is rolled up to form a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), and the curvature effects for small radius nanotubes become significant. In the paper, an analogue of the Bloch theory of crystals with translational symmetry to armchair, zigzag, and chiral SWCNTs, cylindrical lattices with rotation-translational symmetry, is proposed. It is based on the use of cylindrical coordinates, three-dimensional characteristic vectors of the lattice, a reciprocal tube, and rotation-translation transformations in the real and reciprocal 3d spaces. The Brillouin zone on the reciprocal tube and the domain of the wave-vector are determined. An analogue of the Bloch theorem for SWCNTs is stated and proved. A tight-binding approximation scheme for orbitals orthogonal to the nanotube surface is described, and the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices associated with the first and second nearest-neighbor tight-binding approximations are derived.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Surface Holonomy from Multiplicative Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface holonomy and the Wess-Zumino phase play a central role in string theory and Chern-Simons models, yet a completely analytic formulation of their nonabelian counterparts has remained elusive. In this work, we show that Yekutieli's theory of multiplicative integration provides such a formulation and realizes explicitly the higher parallel transport structure of Schreiber and Waldorf. Starting from a smooth 2-connection $(\alpha,\beta)$ on a Lie crossed module, we prove that the corresponding multiplicative integrals satisfy the axioms of a transport 2-functor, thereby providing an explicit model for nonabelian surface holonomy. This framework extends the familiar holonomy on $U(1)$-bundle gerbes to arbitrary gauge 2-bundles whilst avoiding abstract categorical machinery. The resulting three-dimensional Stokes theorem yields the Wess-Zumino phase law and gives an analytic counterpart of the boundary phase relation underlying the Chern-Simons functional.</description>

      <title>A Tight-binding Approach for Computing Subwavelength Guided Modes in Crystals with Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider waveguide systems operating at subwavelength scales. A key feature of these systems is that they are high contrast periodic resonator systems with line defects, leading to resonant phenomena at subwavelength scales. Their spectral properties at the subwavelength scales can be approximated by using the capacitance matrix formulation. Our main objective is to investigate the exponential decay of the off-diagonal elements of the capacitance matrices associated with these waveguide systems. This decay property rigorously justifies a tight-binding approximation, which in turn enables a novel and efficient approach for computing the spectral properties of subwavelength resonators with non-compact defects. Various numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results, including applications to topological interface modes.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Entanglement Cones via Rank-Constrained $C^*$-Convex Hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the geometry of fundamental quantum cones, the separable cone ($\mathscr{P}_+$) and the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) cone ($\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{PPT}}$), under generalized non-commutative convexity. We demonstrate a sharp stability dichotomy analyzing $C^*$-convex hulls of these cones: while $\mathscr{P}_+$ remains stable under local $C^*$-convex combinations, its global $C^*$-convex hull collapses entirely to the cone of all positive semidefinite matrices, $\operatorname{MCL}(\mathscr{P}_+) = \mathscr{P}_0$. To gain finer control and classify intermediate structures, we introduce the concept of ``$k$-$C^*$-convexity'', by using the operator Schmidt rank of $C^*$-coefficients. This constraint defines a new hierarchy of nested intermediate cones, $\operatorname{MCL}_k(\cdot)$. We prove that this hierarchy precisely recovers the known Schmidt number cones for the separable case, establishing a generalized convexity characterization: $\operatorname{MCL}_k(\mathscr{P}_+) = \mathcal{T}_k$. Applied to the PPT cone, this framework generates a family of conjectured non-trivial intermediate cones, $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{PPT}, k}$.</description>

      <title>Two-Point Vortex Confinement in a simply connected domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the vortex confinement property of the two-point vortex system in a planar domain. We compute the time over which initial point vortices around a stable stationary point remain within a slightly larger ball. In particular, we show that this concentration persists indefinitely regardless of the vorticity strengths. In the borderline of the stability condition, we show that this time becomes a power law, if in addition, one relaxes the size of the stability ball.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reconfiguration with Warm-Started SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method with deep learning wave function architectures has led to several successes in ground-state calculations of quantum many-body systems in recent years. However, commonly used stochastic gradient-based methods often perform poorly on these parameter training problems and typically lack convergence guarantees. The stochastic reconfiguration (SR) method provides a robust preconditioner of the stochastic gradient, whose computational cost becomes prohibitive for large parameter spaces owing to the repeated inversion of large covariance matrices. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a warm-started stochastic reconfiguration (WSSR) method, which integrates warm-start techniques from singular value decomposition (SVD) to refine low-rank approximations of the preconditioning matrix iteratively. Numerical experiments on typical atomic and molecular systems highlight the effectiveness of the WSSR method within VMC calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic stability and ergodic properties of quantum trajectories under imperfect measurement, extending previous results established for the ideal case of perfect measurement. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimated trajectory, initialized from an estimated state, to the true trajectory. This result is obtained assuming that the associated quantum channel is irreducible. Building on this, we prove the uniqueness of the invariant measure and demonstrate convergence toward this measure.</description>

      <title>An Orbifold Framework for Classifying Layer Groups with an Application to Knitted Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled structures such as textiles, polymer networks, and architected metamaterials are often doubly periodic. Due to this property and their finite transverse thickness, the symmetries of these materials are described by the crystallographic layer groups. While orbifold notation provides a compact topological description and classification of the planar wallpaper groups, no analogous framework has been available for the spatial layer groups. In this article we develop an orbifold theory in three dimensions and introduce a complete set of Conway-type symbols for all layer groups. To illustrate its applicability, we analyze several knitted fabric motifs and show how their layer-group symmetries are naturally expressed in this new orbifold notation. This work establishes a foundation for the topological classification of doubly periodic structures beyond the planar setting and supports structure-function analysis in layered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the magnetization of the critical mean-field O(N) model with N &gt; 1. Specifically, we bound the Wasserstein distance between the finite-volume and limiting distributions, in terms of the number of spins. To achieve this, we extend a recent multivariate nonnormal approximation theorem. This generalizes known results for the Curie-Weiss magnetization to the multivariate O(N) setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$-wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We obtain various analytic formulas based on the two-band Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A new proof of the Th\'eor\`eme de Structure related to a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a Leray's weak solution to the Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem enjoys a partial regularity which is known in the literature as the Th\'eor\`eme de Structure of a Leray's weak solution. As well, this result has been extended by some authors to the case of the IBVP. In this note, we achieve the Th\'eor\`eme de Structure by means of a new proof. Our proof is based on a priori estimates for a suitable approximating sequence. In this way our result covers a more general setting in the sense that, e.g., we can also include the case of the weak solutions furnished by Hopf for an IBVP in bounded domains without requiring an energy inequality in a strong form, but just employing a priori estimates on the Galerkin approximation.</description>

      <title>Geometric control of boundary-catalytic branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on boundary absorbing regions. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics and life sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle in the $L^p$ sense by applying the Littlewood-Paley-Stein inequality. Our model is an asymmetric Ginzburg-Landau interface model on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Assuming convexity of the potential,we derive detailed error estimates, particularly their dependence on the size of the system and the size of the region on which the sample average is taken. Notably, the estimates are uniform in the strength of the asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Quantum Groups and Yang-Baxter Equation For Probabilists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are a set of lecture notes for a mini-course I gave at The University of Warwick from October 30th to November 1st, 2024. Recordings of the lectures are available on Oleg Zaboronski's webpage at https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/oleg_zaboronski/jeffrey_kuan_visit/ . The main body of the notes covers the content of the lectures, and provides an introduction to Drinfel'd-Jimbo quantum groups and the Yang-Baxter equation, with a probabilist as the target audience. The appendix contains several topics, requested by colleagues during my visit to the United Kingdom, which all depend on the main set of notes.
  The notes begin by defining what it means for the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) to be integrable, in the sense of satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation. It then provides the algebraic background for the Yang-Baxter equation, by defining Drinfel'd-Jimbo groups as a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra. The algebraic background motivates generalizations of ASEP to stochastic vertex models and "fused" models. Each section corresponds to approximately an hour of lecture time.
  The appendix covers the F.R.T. construction, Hecke algebras, the matrix product ansatz, and orthogonal polynomial vertex weights. The topics in the appendix can be read independently of each other.

      <title>Floer sections in multisymplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In symplectic geometry, Floer theory is the most important tool to prove the existence of time-periodic solutions in Hamiltonian mechanics. The core observation is that the $L^2$-gradient lines of the symplectic action functional are pseudo-holomorphic curves, enabling the use of elliptic PDE methods. Multisymplectic geometry is the geometric framework underlying Hamiltonian field theory, where the time line is replaced by higher-dimensional manifolds. In the case of two dimensions and using complex structures, we introduce a novel multisymplectic framework that is fit for the generalization of the elliptic methods from symplectic geometry. Besides proving a Darboux theorem, we show that the $L^2$-gradient lines of our multisymplectic action functional are now pseudo-Fueter curves defined using a compatible almost hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Higher-order diffusion and Cahn-Hilliard-type models revisited on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve explicitly and analyze rigorously inhomogeneous initial-boundary-value problems (IBVP) for several fourth-order variations of the traditional diffusion equation and the associated linearized Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) model (also Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation), formulated in the spatiotemporal quarter-plane. Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers. The solution formulae established herein are expected to find utility in well-posedness studies for nonlinear counterparts too.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations of metric spaces and Lorentzian pre-length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce conformal transformations in the synthetic setting of metric spaces and Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces. Our main focus lies on the Lorentzian case, where, motivated by the need to extend classical notions to spaces of low regularity, we provide the first consistent notion of conformal length, and analyse its fundamental properties. We prove that the conformal time separation function $\tau_{\Omega}$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes. We also prove conformal invariance of angles and causality conditions, give a characterisation of global hyperbolicity via finiteness of $\tau_{\Omega}$ for all conformal factors, and establish the behaviour of the Lorentzian Hausdorff measure defined in [MS22a] under conformal changes. Moreover, we apply the same methods to the metric case, which is of interest in its own right. This is exemplified by proving an analog of the Nomizu--Ozeki theorem for metric length spaces, which has the advantage that the resulting complete space is conformally related to the original space.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviour of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations. This model is also bijectively equivalent to the Fortuin--Kasteleyn model of planar maps with parameter $q\in (0,4)$ at its self-dual point. These have been traditionally studied using either techniques from analytic combinatorics (based in particular on the gasket decomposition of Borot, Bouttier and Guitter arXiv:1106.0153) or probabilistic arguments (based on Sheffield's hamburger-cheeseburger bijection arXiv:1108.2241). In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point. This can be thought of as the planar map analogue of Nienhuis' predictions for the critical point of the loop-$O(n)$ model on the hexagonal lattice. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for geometric features of the FK model of planar maps when $0 &lt; q &lt;4$, such as the exact tail behaviour of the perimeters of clusters and loops. This sharpens previous results of arXiv:1502.00450 and arXiv:1502.00546. A key step is to use the above dictionary and the probabilistic results to justify rigorously an ansatz commonly assumed in the analytic combinatorics literature.</description>

      <title>On cable-graph percolation between dimensions 2 and 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Gaussian free field on two-dimensional slabs with a thickness described by a height $h$ at spatial scale $N$. We investigate the radius of critical clusters for the associated cable-graph percolation problem, which depends sensitively on the parameter $h$. Our results unveil a whole family of new "fixed points", which interpolate between recent results from arXiv:2303.03782 in two dimensions and from arXiv:2405.17417 and arXiv:2406.02397 in three dimensions, and describe critical behaviour beyond those regimes. In the delocalised phase, the one-arm decay exhibits a "plateau", i.e. it doesn't depend on the speed at which the variance of the field diverges in the large-$N$ limit. Our methods rely on a careful analysis of the interplay between two- and three-dimensional effects for the underlying random walk, which manifest themselves in a corresponding decomposition of the field.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of (1+2)-dimensional linear partial differential of Asian options pricing. Special cases have been used to models of financial mathematics. We carry out group classification of a class equations. In particular, the maximum dimension Lie invariance algebra within the above class is eight-dimensional. It is shown that an equation with such an algebra can be transformed into the linear Kolmogorov equation with the help of the point transformations of variables. Using the operators of invariance algebra symmetry reduction is carried out and invariant exact solutions are constructed for some equations.</description>

      <title>The 3d mixed BF Lagrangian 1-form: a variational formulation of Hitchin's integrable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of gauged Lagrangian $1$-forms, extending the notion of Lagrangian $1$-forms to the setting of gauge theories. This general formalism is applied to a natural geometric Lagrangian $1$-form on the cotangent bundle of the space of holomorphic structures on a smooth principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ over a compact Riemann surface $C$ of arbitrary genus $g$, with or without marked points, in order to gauge the symmetry group of smooth bundle automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}$. The resulting construction yields a multiform version of the $3$d mixed BF action with so-called type A and B defects, providing a variational formulation of Hitchin's completely integrable system over $C$. By passing to holomorphic local trivialisations and going partially on-shell, we obtain a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. The cases of genus $0$ and $1$ with marked points are treated in greater detail, producing explicit Lagrangian $1$-forms for the rational Gaudin hierarchy and the elliptic Gaudin hierarchy, respectively, with the elliptic spin Calogero-Moser hierarchy arising as a special subcase.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Bogoliubov approximation for the many-body quantum dynamics of weakly interacting Bose gases and establish a uniform-in-time validity of the Bogoliubov theory. The proof relies on a detailed analysis of the dispersive behavior of the symplectic Bogoliubov dynamics, which allows for a rigorous derivation of the Bogoliubov theory as an effective description of quantum fluctuations around the Bose-Einstein condensate on all time scales.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory, extending previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. By utilizing Hermitian and reflection positivity conditions, alongside Schwinger-Dyson (SD) loop equations, we compute rigorous bounds for the expectation values of plaquette Wilson loops in 2D, 3D, and 4D YM theories. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. To enhance the approach, we introduce a novel twist-reflection positivity condition, which we prove to be exact in 2D YM theory. Additionally, we propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operators are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying computations. SD equations for double-trace Wilson loops are also derived in detail. Our findings suggest that the positivity bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond single-trace cases, providing a solid foundation for further non-perturbative investigations of gauge theories using positivity-based methods.</description>

Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the spectra of general non-minimal second-order operators. To do this, we derive the local part of the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficient for such operators in a completely model-independent way. Afterwards, we provide three examples to show how our result can be applied in practical scenarios. In particular, we emphasize this discussion when dealing with a toy-model of dynamical torsion, which is viewed as a simple instance of higher-spin fields. All our results are compatible with the literature, and we provide a Mathematica notebook with the model-independent results that are written in the paper.</description>

      <title>A Fractional Variational Approach to Spectral Filtering Using the Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Geometry of Gravity, Strings and Fields: A Panoramic Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are expanded lecture notes of a mini-course whose objectives were to introduce the basic concepts, constructions and techniques of noncommutative geometry, as well as their uses as a framework for modelling quantum spacetime. Key mathematical approaches presented include operator algebras such as $C^*$-algebras, K-theory, spectral geometry, quantum groups, and deformation quantization. Physical application areas considered include string theory, quantum field theory, and the Standard Model, as well as certain condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro Crossing Kernels at Rational Central Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report novel analytic results for the Virasoro modular and fusion kernels relevant to 2d conformal field theories (CFTs), 3d topological field theories (TQFTs), and the representation theory of certain quantum groups. For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\infty,1]\cup[25,\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.</description>
