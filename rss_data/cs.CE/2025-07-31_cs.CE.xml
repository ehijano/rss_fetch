      <title>An entropy-stable and kinetic energy-preserving macro-element HDG method for compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a high order numerical framework for efficient and robust simulation of compressible flows. To address the inefficiencies of standard hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods in large scale settings, we develop a macro element HDG method that reduces global and local degrees of freedom by embedding continuous Galerkin structure within macro-elements. This formulation supports matrix free implementations and enables highly parallel local solves, leading to substantial performance gains and excellent scalability on modern architectures. To enhance robustness in under resolved or turbulent regimes, we extend the method using entropy variables and a flux differencing approach to construct entropy stable and kinetic energy preserving variants. These formulations satisfy a discrete entropy inequality and improve stability without compromising high order accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on benchmark problems including the inviscid isentropic vortex and the Taylor Green vortex in both inviscid and turbulent regimes. Numerical results confirm optimal accuracy, improved robustness, and up to an order of magnitude speedup over standard HDG methods. These developments mark a significant advancement in high order methods for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Cycles Protocol: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Clearing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For centuries, financial institutions have responded to liquidity challenges by forming closed, centralized clearing clubs with strict rules and membership that allow them to collaborate on using the least money to discharge the most debt. As closed clubs, much of the general public has been excluded from participation. But the vast majority of private sector actors consists of micro or small firms that are vulnerable to late payments and generally ineligible for bank loans. This low liquidity environment often results in gridlock and leads to insolvency, and it disproportionately impacts small enterprises and communities.
  On the other hand, blockchain communities have developed open, decentralized settlement systems, along with a proliferation of store of value assets and new lending protocols, allowing anyone to permissionlessly transact and access credit. However, these protocols remain used primarily for speculative purposes, and so far have fallen short of the large-scale positive impact on the real economy prophesied by their promoters.
  We address these challenges by introducing Cycles, an open, decentralized clearing, settlement, and issuance protocol. Cycles is designed to enable firms to overcome payment inefficiencies, to reduce their working capital costs, and to leverage diverse assets and liquidity sources, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and lending protocols, in service of clearing more debt with less money. Cycles solves real world liquidity challenges through a privacy-preserving multilateral settlement platform based on a graph optimization algorithm. The design is based on a core insight: liquidity resides within cycles in the payment network's structure and can be accessed via settlement flows optimized to reduce debt.</description>

      <title>A holomorphic Kolmogorov-Arnold network framework for solving elliptic problems on arbitrary 2D domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed holomorphic neural networks (PIHNNs) have recently emerged as efficient surrogate models for solving differential problems. By embedding the underlying problem structure into the network, PIHNNs require training only to satisfy boundary conditions, often resulting in significantly improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In this work, we improve and extend the application of PIHNNs to two-dimensional problems. First, we introduce a novel holomorphic network architecture based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation (PIHKAN), which achieves higher accuracy with reduced model complexity. Second, we develop mathematical extensions that broaden the applicability of PIHNNs to a wider class of elliptic partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation. Finally, we propose a new method based on Laurent series theory that enables the application of holomorphic networks to multiply-connected plane domains, thereby removing the previous limitation to simply-connected geometries.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning for efficient exploration of combinatorial structural design spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for performance-driven structural design that combines bottom-up design generation with learned strategies to efficiently search large combinatorial design spaces. Motivated by the limitations of conventional top-down approaches such as optimization, the framework instead models structures as compositions of predefined elements, aligning form finding with practical constraints like constructability and component reuse. With the formulation of the design task as a sequential decision-making problem and a human learning inspired training algorithm, the method adapts reinforcement learning for structural design. The framework is demonstrated by designing steel braced truss frame cantilever structures, where trained policies consistently generate distinct, high-performing designs that display structural performance and material efficiency with the use of structural strategies that align with known engineering principles. Further analysis shows that the agent efficiently narrows its search to promising regions of the design space, revealing transferable structural knowledge.</description>

      <title>Modelling and simulation of electro-mechanically coupled dielectric elastomers and myocardial tissue using smoothed finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modelling offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to experimental studies in biomedical engineering. In cardiac electro-mechanics, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations provide valuable insights into diseased tissue behaviour and the development of assistive systems such as di-electric elastomer actuators. However, the use of automatically generated tetrahedral meshes, commonly applied due to geometric complexity, often leads to numerical issues including overly stiff responses and volume locking, particularly in incompressible materials. Smoothed finite element methods (S-FEMs) offer a promising alternative by softening the stiffness matrix through gradient smoothing over defined smoothing domains. This work extends S-FEM formulations to electro-mechanically coupled problems and compares their performance against standard linear FEM. We implement and evaluate four approaches in the Abaqus environment via custom user elements: standard linear FEM, face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM), node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM), and the hybrid face/node-based S-FEM (FSNS-FEM). Two benchmark problems are studied: the electrically induced contraction of a compressible dielectric elastomer and an incompressible, orthotropic myocardial tissue sample. Reference solutions are obtained using a mesh consisting of higher-order elements. Our results demonstrate that FSNS-FEM provides the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, closely matching reference data. NS-FEM produces softer results, which leads to an overestimation of the true deformation. FS-FEM and standard FEM consistently exhibit overly stiff behaviour, with pronounced volume locking in the myocardial case. These findings support the potential of S-FEMs, in particular FSNS-FEM, for accurate simulation of coupled electro-mechanical behaviour in complex biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Mesh based segmentation for automated margin line generation on incisors receiving crown treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide the train and test datasets for the community.</description>

      <title>Automated Test Data Generation for Enterprise Protobuf Systems: A Metaclass-Enhanced Statistical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale enterprise systems utilizing Protocol Buffers (protobuf) present significant challenges for performance testing, particularly when targeting intermediate business interfaces with complex nested data structures. Traditional test data generation approaches are inadequate for handling the intricate hierarchical and graph-like structures inherent in enterprise protobuf schemas. This paper presents a novel test data generation framework that leverages Python's metaclass system for dynamic type enhancement and statistical analysis of production logs for realistic value domain extraction. Our approach combines automatic schema introspection, statistical value distribution analysis, and recursive descent algorithms for handling deeply nested structures. Experimental evaluation on three real-world enterprise systems demonstrates up to 95\% reduction in test data preparation time and 80\% improvement in test coverage compared to existing approaches. The framework successfully handles protobuf structures with up to 15 levels of nesting and generates comprehensive test suites containing over 100,000 test cases within seconds.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Optimization and Algorithm for Finite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-period mean-variance optimization is a long-standing problem, caused by the failure of dynamic programming principle. This paper studies the mean-variance optimization in a setting of finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the objective is to maximize the combined metrics of mean and variance of the accumulated rewards at terminal stage. By introducing the concepts of pseudo mean and pseudo variance, we convert the original mean-variance MDP to a bilevel MDP, where the outer is a single parameter optimization of the pseudo mean and the inner is a standard finite-horizon MDP with an augmented state space by adding an auxiliary state of accumulated rewards. We further study the properties of this bilevel MDP, including the optimality of history-dependent deterministic policies and the piecewise quadratic concavity of the inner MDPs' optimal values with respect to the pseudo mean. To efficiently solve this bilevel MDP, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternatingly updates the inner optimal policy and the outer pseudo mean. We prove that this algorithm converges to a local optimum. We also derive a sufficient condition under which our algorithm converges to the global optimum. Furthermore, we apply this approach to study the mean-variance optimization of multi-period portfolio selection problem, which shows that our approach exactly coincides with the classical result by Li and Ng (2000) in financial engineering. Our approach builds a new avenue to solve mean-variance optimization problems and has wide applicability to any problem modeled by MDPs, which is further demonstrated by examples of mean-variance optimization for queueing control and inventory management.</description>

      <title>A surrogate model for topology optimisation of elastic structures via parametric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics. Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.</description>

      <title>MASCA: LLM based-Multi Agents System for Credit Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling. However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions. Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment, addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit scoring.</description>

      <title>Dynamic flux surrogate-based partitioned methods for interface problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loosely coupled partitioned methods for multiphysics problems treat each subproblem as a separate entity and advance them independently in time. In so doing these methods enable code reuse, increase concurrency and provide a convenient framework for plug-and-play multiphysics simulations. However, mathematically loosely coupled schemes are equivalent to a single step of an iterative solution method, which can compromise their accuracy and stability. We present a new data-driven partitioned method for coupled parametric PDEs that can improve upon the accuracy of traditional loosely coupled methods without incurring a performance penalty. To that end, we replace conventional field transfers across the interface by a surrogate for the dynamics of the interface flux exchanged between the subdomains. To develop this surrogate we apply dynamic mode decomposition to a non-standard staggered-in-time state, comprising the interface flux and small solution patches near the interface. The new approach shifts the main computational burden to an offline training phase, whereas application of the surrogate in the online phase amounts to a single matrix-vector multiplication. We provide stability analysis of the surrogate-based partitioned scheme and include numerical results that demonstrate its potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their application in scientific domains such as chemistry remains hindered by shallow domain understanding and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we focus on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM, ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge points to enhance the model's understanding of the fundamental principles and logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical reasoning. Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that ChemDFM-R achieves cutting-edge performance while providing interpretable, rationale-driven outputs. Further case studies illustrate how explicit reasoning chains significantly improve the reliability, transparency, and practical utility of the model in real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Predict Patient Self-reported Race from Skin Histological Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC: 0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI deployment in pathology.
