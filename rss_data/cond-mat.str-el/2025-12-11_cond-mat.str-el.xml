      <title>Anisotropic scattering rates in strain-tuned Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we analyze the temperature, frequency, and momentum dependence of the single-particle scattering rate in a model of the $\gamma$-band of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under strain, with particular emphasis on the behavior near the Lifshitz transition where the Fermi energy crosses a single Van Hove point. While the scattering rate is only moderately anisotropic at zero strain, we find that it becomes strongly anisotropic at the Lifshitz point. At the lowest energies, we recover the expected universal behavior: the scattering rate varies (ignoring logarithmic corrections) as $\tau^{-1}\sim \omega $ at the Van Hove point and as $\tau^{-1}\sim \omega^{3/2}$ away from it. At higher energies, however, corrections of order $\omega^2$ become important in both regimes. We show that the experimentally observed behavior $\tau^{-1} \sim \omega^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.4(2)$ at the Van Hove point can be quantitatively explained by a superposition of linear and quadratic contributions to the scattering rate, which are comparable in magnitude at the intermediate energies probed by experiment, rather than in terms of a new universal power law. We further predict a distinctive anisotropy, strain dependence, and a non-monotonic frequency dependence of the scattering rate at a Lifshitz transition, all of which may be directly tested in experiments.</description>

      <title>How a bilayer Nickelate superconducts: a Quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using determinant Quantum Monte Carlo, we investigate the interplay between doping, inter-layer tunneling and onsite Hund's coupling in stabilizing superconductivity (SC) in a two-orbital model for the bilayer Nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$. With realistic dispersion and for certain values of the interaction parameters, the auxiliary-field-decoupled fermion Hamiltonian has Kramers anti-unitary symmetries which guarantee the absence of a sign problem. The same anti-unitary symmetries can also be used to show there is a second instability towards $(\pi,\pi)$ exciton condensation in the strong interaction limit. We indicate the possible connection between this exciton order and the enigmatic density wave state observed in experiment, and clarify the decisive role played by the inter-layer tunneling in the competition between SC and exciton condensation. Finally, possible directions on how to enhance the SC transition temperature and stabilize the SC phase are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory Revealing Dual Field-Induced Transitions in Spin-1/2 Screw-Chain Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ screw-chain compounds with spin-orbit coupling that goes beyond the phenomenological site-dependent $g$-tensor description traditionally used for XXZ-like BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ and related materials. Starting from the symmetry-allowed $JK\Gamma$ Hamiltonian with Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions, we show that the $\Gamma$ interaction naturally generates the four-sublattice pattern associated with the crystal's screw symmetry. Using the density matrix renormalization group, we identify two distinct field-induced transitions. The first is a continuous transition into an intermediate phase, where the symmetry responsible for the two-fold ground-state degeneracy is broken. The second is a first-order transition into the high-field phase, characterized by a discontinuous jump in the spin-spin correlator. Entanglement-entropy scaling confirms that the first transition belongs to the Ising critical point with the central charge $1/2$. These results establish a microscopic framework for pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ screw-chain systems such as Co$^{2+}$ materials, uncover an intermediate phase whose width increases with $\Gamma$, and provide guidance for systematic exploration of additional field orientations and structural distortions.</description>

      <title>Magnetochiral eigenstate of the Heisenberg chain with spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to construct atypical high-energy eigenstates in quantum systems by using ground states of Hamiltonians deformed by conserved charges. For the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX chain we study a chiral Hamiltonian built from the scalar-chirality charge and total magnetization and solve it exactly by Bethe ansatz. Its ground state is a magnetized, current-carrying XXX eigenstate that breaks SU(2), time-reversal, and parity yet stays critical. This zero-entropy macrostate shows ballistic spin and chirality transport and admits realistic cold-atom and Rydberg platforms.</description>

      <title>Observation of ubiquitous charge correlations and hidden quantum critical point in hole-doped kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $\pi$-shifted (ISD-$\pi$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$\pi$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$\pi$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$\pi$ patches.</description>

      <title>Modified Kondorsky Domain Reversal in Microstructured Phase-Separated Manganites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hole-doped manganite (La$_{1-y}$Pr$_{y}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LPCMO) shows electronic phase separation between ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) and anti-ferromagnetic charge-ordered insulating (AFM-COI) regions. In this study, (La$_{0.5}$Pr$_{0.5}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LP5CMO) microstructures were fabricated using photolithography on thin films grown on (110) NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) substrates. We investigated the domain reversal mechanism of these microstructures through magnetotransport measurements. Our results demonstrate that, while bulk (unpatterned) films follow the standard Kondorsky model for domain reversal, the microstructures obey a modified Kondorsky model. This difference indicates that local magnetic fields from reversed domains significantly influence the coercive field in confined geometries. Although we did not observe a strong electric field effect, this study establishes that magnetotransport measurements are a feasible method for probing the competition between shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in manganite microstructures, which could provide an alternative path for controlling magnetic domains at low current densities.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensionality-induced tunable ferromagnetism in SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials near electronic or magnetic phase boundaries exhibit enhanced tunability, as their emergent properties become highly sensitive to external perturbations. Here, we demonstrate precise control of ferromagnetism in a SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin film, where a high density of states (DOS), arising from low-dimensional quantum states, places the system at the crossover between a non-magnetic and bulk ferromagnetic state. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES/ARPES), transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, we systematically tune the Fermi level via electron doping across the high-DOS point. We directly visualize the spin-split band structure and reveal its influence on both magnetic and transport properties. Our findings provide compelling evidence that magnetism can be engineered through DOS control at a phase crossover, establishing a pathway for the rational design of tunable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Transport properties and thermopower of the spinful Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electric and thermoelectric transport through a spinful complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) quantum dot coupled to metallic leads, forming a N-SYK-N junction, by the Keldysh field theory approach. Unlike traditional equilibrium approaches, our formulation treats the system as an open, interacting quantum conductor under non-equilibrium conditions, without resorting to the replica trick. Starting from the exact Keldysh-Dyson equations, we derive analytical results for the tunneling and zero-temperature limits and perform a numerical analysis in the linear-response regime. We characterize the dependence of conductance, thermoelectric coefficient, and Seebeck effect on the particle-hole asymmetry parameter and coupling strength to the leads. Our results reveal distinctive non-Fermi liquid signatures of the SYK model in transport properties and identify coupling regimes where thermoelectric effects are enhanced, suggesting experimentally accessible fingerprints of SYK physics in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Single-crystal growth, structural characterization, and physical properties of a decorated square-kagome antiferromagnet KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square-kagome lattice, composed of two-dimensional corner-sharing triangles, provides a novel platform for studying frustrated magnetism. However, material realizations of the square-kagome lattice remain scarce. Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\mathrm{FE1}\sim30$ K and $T_\mathrm{FE2}\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra. These results suggest that a three-dimensional model incorporating interlayer couplings via decorating sites is essential for capturing the magnetic and electric behaviors in KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl.</description>

      <title>Contrasting magnetic behavior in MnSc_2X_4 (X = S, Se) spinel compounds investigated by magnetoelastic studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinel compounds MnSc_2X_4 are highly frustrated and candidate materials for vortex-like 3q magnetic states, such as skyrmions, with propagation vectors in the [111] plane. Because of the strong magnetoelastic coupling, we could extract a refined magnetic (H, T) phase diagram for MnSc_2S_4 from ultrasound and dilatometry measurements. We found a variety of magnetic phases, including the skyrmion phase, which is stable down to lowest temperatures. In comparison, we investigated MnSc_2Se_4 , having a larger distance between the magnetic Mn^3+ ions using the same methods. Unlike in MnSc_2S_4 , we found no skyrmion phase and overall a lack of sharp anomalies indicative of phase transitions, neither in dilatometry nor ultrasound nor in specific heat and ac-susceptibility data. Motivated by our findings, we performed model calculations, which reproduced the experimentally observed magnetostriction and specific-heat results reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Real-time collisions of fractional charges in a trapped-ion Jackiw-Rebbi field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</description>

      <title>Extreme statistics as a probe of the superfluid to Bose-glass Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains have highlighted the role of rare, chain-breaking events that favor localization, in particular for high-energy eigenstates related to many-body localization. In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy.</description>

      <title>On modeling quantum point contacts in quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum point contacts (QPC) are a key instrument in investigating the physics of edge excitations in the quantum Hall effect. However, at not-so-high bias voltage values, the predictions of the conventional point QPC model often deviate from the experimental data both in the integer and (more prominently) in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of the possible explanations for such behaviors is the dependence of the tunneling between the edges on energy, an effect not present in the conventional model. Here we introduce two models that take QPC spatial extension into account: wide-QPC model that accounts for the distance along which the edges are in contact; long-QPC model accounts for the fact that the tunneling amplitude originates from a finite bulk gap and a finite distance between the two edges. We investigate the predictions of these two models in the integer quantum Hall regime for the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude. We find that these two models predict opposite dependences: the amplitude decreasing or increasing away from the Fermi level. We thus elucidate the effect of the QPC geometry on the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude and investigate its implications for transport observables.</description>

Here, we identify a second building block for quantum geometry: a band-resolved adiabatic connection operator that captures the noncommutativity between band projectors and their momentum derivatives. The band-resolved adiabatic connection operator, first introduced in the theory of adiabatic driving, serves as a generalized angular momentum within the state manifold of single bands, and we employ it to reformulate expressions for the band-resolved orbital magnetic moment. This form provides a complementary geometric interpretation alongside the multiband separation between energetic- and quantum-state properties by the two-state Berry curvature. Our formalism allows us to present formulas valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate bands, thereby removing the limitations of the common Bloch-state formula. We illustrate our theory by calculating a large orbital magnetization emerging without spin-orbit coupling in a spin-compensated, noncoplanar anomalous Hall magnet with degenerate bands.</description>

      <title>Transport Scaling and Critical Tilt Effects in Disordered 2D Dirac Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions occur ubiquitously in condensed matter systems from topological phases to quantum critical points. Since the advent of topological semimetals, where the dispersion is often tilted around the band crossing where the Dirac fermion can appear, tilt has emerged as a key handle that controls physical properties. We study how tilt affects the transport and spectral properties of tilted 2D Dirac fermions under scalar disorder. Although our spectral analyses always show conformity to appropriate Gaussian ensembles, suggestive of delocalization, the conductivity scaling $g(L)$ shows a surprising richness. For a single Dirac node, relevant for quantum Hall transitions and topological insulator surface states, we find $g(L)\sim a_1\log(L)$ with a tilt-dependent coefficient $a_1&gt;0$. Interestingly, when the tilt and transport directions are aligned, $a_1$ and hence $g(L)$ shows a spike at the critical point between the type-I and type-II regimes of the Dirac node. For systems with two Dirac nodes with unbroken time-reversal symmetry, pertinent to quasi-2D Dirac materials, we find $g(L)\sim L^{a_1}(\log L)^{a_2}$. However, we find a surprising tension between tilt along and perpendicular to the transport directions. For the former, $a_1$ changes sign as a function of tilt, hinting at a tilt-driven localization-delocalization transition, while $a_1&lt;0$ for all tilts in the latter case, implying localization. These localized behaviors also reveal tension with the delocalization seen in spectral properties and suggest differing localization tendencies in real and Hilbert spaces. Overall, our work identifies tilt as an essential control parameter that uncovers rich and unconventional transport physics in 2D Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction via purification using a single auxiliary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.</description>

      <title>Gate tuning of coupled electronic and structural phase transition in atomically thin Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing an excitonic insulator phase from narrow-gap semiconductors remains challenging, as unambiguous experimental signatures are difficult to establish. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has been widely regarded as a leading candidate, yet the nature of its phase transition and insulating state remains controversial. Here, we report a systematic Raman spectroscopy study of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ as a function of thickness and field-effect doping, complemented by electrical transport measurements. The phase transition persists down to the monolayer limit, with the critical temperature increasing as thickness decreases. In bilayer samples, both electron and hole doping suppress the insulating state, with electron doping lowering and hole doping raising the transition temperature. Importantly, the quasi-elastic scattering, previously attributed to excitonic fluctuations, evolves monotonically across the entire doping range, inconsistent with the expected suppression of excitonic correlations by Coulomb screening. These findings rule out a dominant excitonic mechanism and instead point to a coupled electronic and structural phase transition, whose stability is tunable by carrier doping. Our doping-based approach offers a general strategy for evaluating the role of excitonic effects in candidate excitonic insulators.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Magnons, Defects, and Rapid Energy Migration on the Optical Properties of the 2D Magnet CrPS4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between optical and magnetic excitations could enable contactless, spatially resolved, or ultrafast interrogation and control of magnetism two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices. The layered 2D A-type antiferromagnet CrPS4 stands out among van der Waals (vdW) magnets for its rich optical fine structure, but its spectroscopy is not yet understood and has so far been interpreted without consideration of magnetic exchange. Here, we show that this fine structure comes primarily from exchange-mediated coupling between on-site optical "spin-flip" transitions of Cr3+ and low-energy spin transitions involving the surrounding lattice. Well-resolved magnon sidebands to optical 4A2 &lt;--&gt; 2E transitions are observed in photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation spectra, as well as a pronounced PL sideband due to short-range exchange splitting. Energy migration is probed using Yb3+ dopants as traps, revealing sub-picosecond inter-site excitation hopping. Formation of dispersive Frenkel excitons of coupled on-site d-d transitions due to inter-site exchange is discussed. In addition to impacting how optical fine structure is interpreted in this and potentially other vdW magnets, these findings may have ramifications for future applications of layered 2D magnets by revealing new opportunities to drive mode-specific spin-wave excitations using light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect, a hallmark of many-body physics, emerges from the antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins and conduction fermions, leading to a correlated many-body singlet state. Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Spin excitation continuum to topological magnon crossover and thermal Hall conductivity in Kitaev magnets</title>

Abstract: There has been great interest in identifying a Kitaev quantum spin liquid state in frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions. In particular, the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of a magnetic field has generated excitement as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized regime. We demonstrate the gradual evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine nonlinear effects on topological magnons and the validity of thermal Hall conductivity computed using linear spin wave theory. We discuss the implications of our results to existing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Disentangling spin excitation continua in classical and quantum magnets using 2D nonlinear spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $K\Gamma\Gamma'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</description>

Abstract: Topological phases of electrons such as topological insulators and quantum Hall states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems, without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or external magnetic field for electron systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. Effects of adiabaticity are calculated. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass we determine that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at intermediate phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. We estimate the transition temperature, determining that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We present thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for an orthopyroxene CoGeO$_3$ with magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions that form quasi-one-dimensional ladders. We show that non-collinear magnetic order below $T_N$=32 K can be stabilized by a strong local easy-axis anisotropy of $j_\text{eff}=1/2$ moments, which is induced by ligand octahedra distortions. Extraction of a magnetic Hamiltonian from inelastic neutron scattering measurements supports this interpretation and allows us to establish an effective magnetic model. The resulting exchange Hamiltonian justifies CoGeO$_3$ as a realization of an Ising spin ladder compound.</description>

Abstract: A site-selective $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study is carried out on the Kondo lattice compound CePtAl$_4$Ge$_2$, which crystallizes in a rhombohedral lattice with quasi-two-dimensional Ce layers forming a triangular lattice network. Two inequivalent Al sites, Al(1) and Al(2), are unambiguously assigned by comparing measured nuclear quadrupole parameters with electric field gradients obtained from electronic structure calculations. Knight shift analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations. At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward the N\'eel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Gating-Induced Resistance Transition in Charge Density Wave Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the gate-induced insulator-to-metal transition in the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase of the Holstein model. Large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations are performed, in which the forces acting on the lattice degrees of freedom are evaluated using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We demonstrate that the onset of CDW instability requires a threshold bias voltage set by the energy of in-gap edge modes. At sufficiently large voltages, the system undergoes an abrupt transition to a metallic state, reminiscent of dielectric breakdown. In the intermediate-voltage regime, our simulations reveal that the transition to a low-resistance state is initiated by the nucleation of a thin conducting layer at the gated electrode. The resulting metal-insulator interface subsequently propagates across the system under the applied bias, leading to the growth of a metallic domain. We further analyze the voltage- and temperature-dependent dynamics of the associated domain walls.</description>

      <title>Hierarchic superradiant phases in anisotropic Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points. We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>A Landau Theory for Pair Density Modulation in Fe(Te,Se) flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments reporting a pair-density modulation (PDM) in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, we develop a Landau theory to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon. We analyze the PDM in terms of the screw symmetry of the single layer, interpreting it as a hybridized state of two order parameters of opposite glide and screw parity. Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling.</description>
