      <title>Electron capture of superheavy nuclei with realistic lepton wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superheavy nuclei push the periodic table of the elements and the chart of the nuclides to their limits, providing a unique laboratory for studies of the electron-nucleus interactions. The most important weak decay mode in known superheavy nuclei is electron capture (EC). In the standard calculations of EC, the lepton wave functions are usually considered in the lowest-order approximation. In this work, we investigate the sensitivity of EC rates on the choice of the electron wave functions by (i) assuming the single-particle approximation for the electron wave functions, and (ii) carrying out Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) calculations. The nuclear response is generated based on the state-of-the-art quasiparticle random phase approximation employing relativistic nuclear energy density functional theory. We show that using the improved lepton wave functions reduces the EC rates up to 40\% in the superheavy nucleus oganesson ($Z=118$). Interestingly, because of screening effects, the difference between the EC rates obtained with the DHF and single-particle calculations is fairly small.</description>

      <title>Elastic and charge transfer cross sections for low to ultralow $\rm{H}(1s) + \rm{H}^{+}$ collisions. Quantal and semiclassical calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic scattering and resonant charge transfer integral cross sections in $\rm{H}(1s) + \rm{H^+}$ collisions are computed for the center-of-mass energy range of $10^{-10}-10$ eV. Fully quantal and semiclassical approaches are utilized in these calculations. The reliability of the semiclassical approximation for very low collision energies is discussed. The results are compared with available data from the literature.</description>

      <title>Degenerate mirrorless lasing in thermal alkali vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a degenerate two-level alkali atom system driven by a linearly polarized continuous-wave pump field, the steady-state gain for an orthogonally polarized probe field was theoretically predicted (Ramaswamy et al., Mirrorless Lasing: A Theoretical Perspective. Opt. Memory and Neural Networks 32, S443-S466 (2023)). Using linear response theory, we calculated the probe absorption spectrum when the pump was detuned from resonance. A sub-natural linewidth dispersive structure was observed near the pump resonance, exhibiting both gain and absorption. Additionally, a distinct pure gain peak appeared at a sideband corresponding to a dressed-state transition. These effects typically do not persist outside the ultracold regime due to inhomogeneous broadening caused by Doppler broadening, which washes out the fine spectral details. We demonstrate that the sideband gain peak is sustained in the warm vapor regime when both the pump Rabi frequency and detuning exceed the Doppler width. Our results can enable degenerate mirrorless lasing in thermal alkali atom vapors, offering a significant enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio for fluoroscopic remote magnetic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Relativistic effects on properties of halogen group elements/ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This srudy investigates the influence of relativistic effects on some properties of the halogen group and gold atoms, including their ions. The analysis covers radii, orbital's energy, first and second ionization energies, electron affinity, and polarizability. The study confirms that the p1/2 orbitals contract under relativistic effects, whereas for the p3/2 orbitals, the mass-velocity and spin-orbit effects do not appear to cancel each other out completely. This may indicate that the spion-orbit effect grows, when increasing the atomic number, slightly faster than the mass-velocity effect. In addition, expansion of the np3/2 orbitals may lead to dilation of the bond length in the related molecules.
  We found that the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock method gave, for atoms from fluorine to iodine, first ionization energy values with smaller deviations from their experimental ones than other methods involving relativistic and correlation effects. In particular, the method accurately, up to three significative digits, predicts the experimental value for chlorine, and thus can be adopted, discarding other sophisticated methods considering the huge computational effort required by them while not improving much on the agreement with experiment, when evaluating physical-chemical properties of large systems containing light halogen elements. It also predicts an electron affinity of $2.4 eV$ for the tennessine atom, where it shows also that the relativistic effects play a more important role than in gold atoms.</description>

      <title>High Harmonic Generation with Orbital Angular Momentum Beams: Beyond-dipole Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the high harmonic generation with vortex beams beyond the dipole approximation. To do so we employ the full minimal coupling approach to account for multipolar coupling without truncation and describe the full spatio-temporal properties of the electromagnetic field. This allows us to investigate the beyond-dipole deviations in electron trajectories and the emitted power, where the influence of the orbital angular momentum contains both magnetic and quadrupolar effects. In contrast to the system driven by plane-wave light, we show that the non-linear dipole dynamics induced by the vortex beams are not confined to the polarization or propagation directions, but also have a component in the orthogonal direction. We identify the effects of the resulting symmetry breaking via increased beyond dipole corrections which are particularly apparent in even harmonics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F\"orster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Nuclear Clock Transitions Frequency Difference between $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ and $^{229}$Th$^{4+}$ via \textit{ab-initio} Self-Consistent Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{229}\text{Th}$ isotope is a promising candidate for nuclear clocks, with its transition frequency influenced by electron-induced nuclear frequency shifts. This effect is comparatively small and requires high-precision theoretical calculations. In this work, we employed a non-perturbative multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method, in contrast to the perturbation theory used previously, to resolve the field shift effect. This method accounts for subtle differences in the nuclear potential while considering the $^{229}\text{Th}$ isotope in both its ground and isomeric states. Consequently, the nuclear transition frequency difference of between $^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}$ and $^{229}\text{Th}^{4+}$ was determined to be $-639$~MHz with computational convergency down to 1~MHz. Given recent precision measured transition frequency of $^{229}\text{Th}^{4+}$in $^{229}\text{Th}$-doped CaF$_2$ [Nature 633, 63 (2024)], the transition frequency of isolated $^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}$ is predicted to be $2,020,406,745 (1)_\text{comp.}(77)_{\delta \langle r^2 \rangle} (100)_\text{ext.}$~MHz, with brackets indicating uncertainties stemming from our atomic structure computations, the input nuclear charge radii from nuclear data tables, and the influence of the crystal environment as reported in the literature. This provides valuable guidance for direct laser excitation of isolated $^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}$ based on ion traps experiments.</description>

      <title>Wafer-level fabrication of fully-dielectric vapor cells for Rydberg atom electrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg-atom electrometry enables highly sensitive electric-field measurements by exploiting the extreme polarizability of Rydberg states in alkali atoms. Millimeter-scale atomic vapor cells can be accurately and economically batch-fabricated by anodically bonding silicon and glass wafers, enabling the large-volume manufacturing of miniature atomic clocks and quantum sensors. However, silicon is not always an ideal constitutive material for electric-field sensing because of its high dielectric constant and conductive losses at millimeter wave frequencies. A broader selection of low-loss all-dielectric alternatives may be beneficial for specific applications. Here, we present an all-glass wafer-level microfabrication process that eliminates silicon, creating hermetically sealed vapor cells that are stable over long timelines with embedded cesium dispensers. Femtosecond laser machining precisely defines the cell geometry, and laser-activated alkali loading ensures reliable filling. We demonstrate long-term vacuum stability and robust Rydberg excitation through electromagnetically induced transparency measurements of several Rydberg states. We used these cells to measure a 34 GHz millimeter wave field resonant with the 58D$_{5/2}\rightarrow$60P$_{3/2}$ transition using Autler-Townes splitting showing expected linear dependence with field strength. This work demonstrates that the all-glass approach offers a highly durable low-loss cell alternative for miniaturized millimeter wave and microwave quantum sensing, with the potential to flexibly incorporate a range of other dielectric and semiconductor materials and integrated photonic and electronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Scattering-asymmetry control with ultrafast electron wave packet shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering of a tightly focused electron beam by an atom forms one of the bases of modern electron microscopy. A fundamental symmetry breaking occurs when the target atom is displaced from the beam center. This displacement results in a deflection of the beam and an asymmetric angular distribution of the scattered electrons. Here we propose a concept to control the sign and magnitude of the scattering asymmetry by shaping the incident high-energy electron wave packet in momentum space on the atto- to picosecond time scale. The shaping controls the ultrafast real-space dynamics of the wave packet, shifting the balance between two competing contributions of the impact-parameter-dependent quantum interference and the momentum distribution of the wave packet on the target. We find a strong sensitivity of the elastic scattering on the wave packet properties, an effect that opens promising new avenues for ultrafast electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>In situ characterization of laser-induced strong field ionization phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing the intensity and duration of strong-field femtosecond pulses within the interaction volume is crucial for attosecond science. However, this remains a major bottleneck, limiting accuracy of the strong-field, and in particular, high harmonic generation experiments. We present a novel scheme for the in situ measurement and control of spatially resolved strong-field femtosecond pulse intensity and duration within the interaction focal region. Our approach combines conjugate focal imaging with in situ ion measurements using gas densities pertinent to attosecond science experiments. Independent measurements in helium and argon, accompanied by a fitting to a strong field ionization dynamic model, yield accurate and consistent results across a wide range of gas densities and underscores the significance of double ionization, as well as barrier suppression ionization. Direct spatially resolved characterization of the driving laser is a critical step towards resolving the averaging problem in the interaction volume, paving the way for more accurate and reliable attosecond experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunably-polarized driving light controls the phase diagram of 1D quasicrystals and 2D quantum Hall matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurements of electric-dipole-transition amplitudes in excited states of $^{208}$Pb using Faraday rotation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have completed measurements of two low-lying excited-state electric-dipole (E1) transition amplitudes in lead. Our measured reduced matrix elements of the $(6s^2 6p^2)^3P_1 \to (6s^2 6p7s)^3P_0$ transition at 368.3 nm and the 405.8 nm $(6s^2 6p^2)^3P_2 \to (6s^2 6p7s)^3P_1$ transition are 1.90(1) a.u. and 3.01(2) a.u. respectively, both measured to sub-1 % precision and both in excellent agreement with the latest $ab \ initio$ lead wavefunction calculations. These measurements were completed by comparing the low-field Faraday optical rotation spectra of each E1 transition in turn with that of the ground-state $^{3}P_0 \to ^{3}P_1$ M1 transition under identical experimental conditions. Our spectroscopy technique involves polarization modulation and lock-in detection yielding microradian-level optical rotation resolution. At temperatures where direct absorption was significant for both E1 and M1 transitions, we also extracted matrix element values from a direct optical absorption depth comparison. As part of this work we designed an interaction region within our furnace which allowed precise determination of our quartz vapor cell sample temperature to provide accurate determination of the Boltzmann thermal population of the low-lying excited states that were studied.</description>
