      <title>The population of NuSTAR Black Hole X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin of a black hole (BH) encodes information about its formation and evolution history. Yet the understanding of the distribution of BH spins in X-ray binaries (XBs), of the models used to measure spin, and of their impact on systematic uncertainties remains incomplete. In this work, we expand on previous analyses of the entire NuSTAR archive of accreting BH XBs. Prior work compiled a sample of 245 spectral fits using the relativistic reflection method for NuSTAR observations of 36 BH systems. Here, we aim to probe two aspects: the connection between BH spin and binary system properties, and the relationship between parameters in spectral fits. We identify moderate negative correlations between spin uncertainty and both BH mass and system inclination, and a moderate positive correlation with distance. We also point out tentative multi-dimensional degeneracies between inclination, disk density, Fe abundance, ionization, and the presence or absence of absorption features from ionized outflows linked to disk winds. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive view of the observed distribution of BH spins in XBs, in comparison to spins inferred from gravitational waves. We find that the distribution of BH spins in XBs can be described by a Beta distribution with $\alpha=5.66$ and $\beta=1.09$. This data set is highly complex, and the analysis presented here does not fully explore all potential parameter correlations. We make the full data set available to the community to encourage further exploration.</description>

      <title>The optical constants and grain sizes of interstellar dust measured directly using the dust scattered x-ray halo of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray scattering is a powerful probe of the optical constants and grain size distribution of interstellar dust. Bright, transient sources are excellent tools for this, since they fade rapidly, leaving only the expanding scattered x-ray halo. Here, we analyse the dust-scattered x-ray halo data of the unprecedentedly bright $\gamma$-ray burst, GRB 221009A, using anomalous diffraction theory to measure the grain size distribution of dust in the Galaxy as well as the complex refractive index, $m$, and use these results to infer the likely composition. We find a complex refractive index, $m=n+ik$ at several x-ray energies, finding $k_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (2.7 \pm 0.7)\times10^{-4}$ and $1-n_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (9 \pm 2)\times 10^{-4}$, strongly inconsistent with the commonly employed assumptions of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation. These results lie in the expected range for interstellar dust compositions dominated by carbon, magnesium silicates, and iron. The absorption results suggest a substantial mass fraction of iron at $35\pm7\%$. The MRN distribution fit returns a maximum grain radius, $a_{\rm max}=0.24\pm 0.01\,\mu$m; all fits strongly rule out models with $\sim0.4\,\mu$m grains for this sightline. The soft x-ray spectrum of the prompt GRB can also be inferred from the fitting, with the best-fit providing a spectral slope that is consistent with the slope of the low energy side of the best-fit Band model of the directly measured prompt emission. Forcing a different grain size or composition than the best fit results in an inferred prompt spectrum different to the observed prompt emission. The refractive index is consistent with standard average dust compositions, showing that x-ray scattering is an effective tool to measure interstellar dust optical properties.

      <title>Luminous, rapidly declining supernovae as stripped transitional objects in low metallicity environments: the case of SN 2022lxg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the optical and near-infrared properties of SN 2022lxg, a bright ($\rm M_{g\, \mathrm{peak}}=-19.41$ mag) and rapidly evolving SN. It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in 10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data. The first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $&gt;15,000$ K) with flash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase is marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the shapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~ $150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving unshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast decline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\pm$ 0.26 mag $\rm (50\,d)^{-1}$ in $g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until $+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a transition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II. However, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d. Its remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\rm M_B$ ~ $-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC value - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence (including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations from spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the observational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass transfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before it underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be more compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow supergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.</description>

      <title>Polarization Studies of Black Widows PSRs B1957+20, J2055+3829 and J1544+4937</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the polarization of three black widow pulsars, PSRs B1957+20, J2055+3829 and J1544+4937 at 1250\,MHz using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Radio eclipses for PSRs B1957+20 and J2055+3829 are detected, while the radio emission for J1544+4937 is detected throughout the eclipse. We study the polarization and dispersion measure properties of the pulsars near and during the eclipse. The position angle of the linear polarization is observed to shift at the eclipse boundary in all of these three pulsars implying a lower limit line-of-sight magnetic field strength of the eclipse medium of approximately a few mG to tens of mG. We also find evidence that the magnetic field in the eclipse medium of PSRs B1957+20 and J1544+4937 reverses.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Sparking: What if mountains on the surface?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical framework to calculate the height and potential of the vacuum inner gap is proposed here. The results show that small mountains on a pulsar's polar cap tend to significantly influence the properties of the inner vacuum gap, making it easier for sparks to form. In this scenario, the magnetospheric activity observed from the pulsars PSR J0250$+$5854 and PSR J2144$-$3933, which lie below the pulsar death line, would be reproduced, and the irregular discharge behaviour in other polar cap regions could also be understood. Furthermore, the presence of small mountains could provide a new way to probe the puzzling state of supranuclear matter inside pulsars. In order to have stable mountains on the surface, pulsars might be made of solid strangeon matter, which is favoured by both the charge neutrality and the flavour symmetry of quarks.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Mass of a Hypothetical Secondary Black Hole in M87 with the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers, each hosting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), are thought to form SMBH binaries. Motivated by recent observations from the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) showing periodic behavior in the M87 jet, a precession of about 11 years and a transverse oscillation of about 0.9 years, we constrain the mass of a hypothetical secondary black hole orbiting the primary SMBH in M87. To constrain the mass ratio between the primary SMBH ($M_{1}$) and the secondary black hole ($M_{2}$) defined as $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1} \leq 1$, and the length of the semimajor axis of the binary system ($a$), we impose the following three constraints: (i) the lower limit of $a$, below which the SMBH binary is expected to merge. (ii) the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies shown in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. (iii) a finite length of the semimajor axis of $M_{1}$, that can induce periodic behavior in the jet. By combining these constraints, we obtain the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$. If either of the EAVN-detected periods ($T$) corresponds to the binary's orbital period, the allowed range of $q$ is $6.9 \times 10^{-3} \le q \le 4.2 \times 10^{-2}$ for $T \approx 11$ years, and $3.7\times 10^{-2} \le q \le 1$ for $T \approx 0.9$ years. VLBI astrometric monitoring of the jet base of M87 is essential to explore the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$.</description>

      <title>The peculiar hard state behaviour of the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities during black hole X-ray binary outbursts is a key diagnostic of the coupling between accretion inflows (traced by X-rays) and relativistic jet outflows (traced by radio). We present the radio--X-ray correlation of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Our observations span a broad dynamic range, covering $\sim$4 orders of magnitude in radio luminosity and $\sim$6.5 in X-ray luminosity. This source follows an unusually radio-quiet track, exhibiting significantly lower radio luminosities at a given X-ray luminosity than both the standard (radio-loud) track and most previously known radio-quiet systems. Across most of the considered distance range ($D {\sim} 1.5--4.3$ kpc), Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 appears to be the most radio-quiet black hole binary identified to date. For distances ${\geq} 4$ kpc, while Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 becomes comparable to one other extremely radio-quiet system, its peak X-ray luminosity (${\gtrsim} 5{\times}10^{38}$ erg/s) exceeds that of any previously reported hard-state black hole low-mass X-ray binary, emphasising the extremity of this outburst. Additionally, for the first time in a radio-quiet system, we identify the onset of X-ray spectral softening to coincide with a change in trajectory through the radio--X-ray plane. We assess several proposed explanations for radio-quiet behaviour in black hole systems in light of this dataset. As with other such sources, however, no single mechanism fully accounts for the observed properties, highlighting the importance of regular monitoring and the value of comprehensive (quasi-)simultaneous datasets.</description>

      <title>Data from FAST and MeerKAT reviews as a test of radio pulsar physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data from the FAST and MeerKAT surveys has significantly increased the number of radio pulsars for which the polarization characteristics of their mean profiles have been determined in detail. This has allowed us to confirm earlier conclusions both about the nature of propagation of two orthogonal modes in the pulsar magnetospheres and about the mechanism of particle production in neutron star polar regions and their evolutionary features. We can now say with even greater confidence that mean profiles formed by the O-mode are significantly wider than those formed by the X-mode. Moreover, the observations confirm the validity of the classical Ruderman-Sutherland vacuum model of particle generation, as well as the evolution of the inclination angles of the magnetic axis to the rotation one in the direction of $90^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Link between Fast Radio Burst and Binary Neutron Star Origins with Spaceborne Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is an open question, with observations suggesting that at least some are associated with old stellar populations. It has been proposed that some repeating FRBs may be produced by interactions of the binary neutron star magnetospheres decades to centuries before the coalescence. These systems would also emit centi-Hertz gravitational waves during this period, which can be detectable by space-borne gravitational wave detectors. We explore the prospects of using current and future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as TianQin, LISA, and DECIGO, to test this FRB formation hypothesis. Focusing on nearby galaxies like M81, which hosts a repeating FRB source in a globular cluster, we calculate the detection capabilities for binary neutron star systems. Our analysis reveals that while missions like TianQin and LISA face limitations in horizon distance, changing detector pointing direction could significantly enhance detection probabilities. Considering the chance of a Milky Way-like galaxy coincidentally containing a BNS within 100 years before merger is only $3\times10^{-5}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$, if a signal is detected originating from M81, we can establish the link between FRB and binary neutron stars with a significance level of at least 2.81$\sigma$, or a Bayes factor of $4\times10^6 - 7\times10^8$ / $5\times10^2 - 10^5$ against the background model with optimistic/realistic assumptions. Next-generation detectors such as DECIGO offer enhanced capabilities and should easily detect these systems in M81 and beyond. Our work highlights the critical role of space-borne gravitational wave missions in unraveling FRB origins.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Wavelength Context of Delayed Radio Emission in TDEs: Evidence for Accretion-Driven Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations presented in Cendes et al. (2024a) show that optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs) commonly produce delayed radio emission that can peak years post-disruption. Here, we explore the multi-wavelength properties of a sample of radio-observed optically selected TDEs to shed light on the physical process(es) responsible for the late-rising radio emission. We combine new late-time X-ray observations with archival optical, UV, X-ray, and radio data to conclude that a diversity of accretion-driven outflows may power delayed radio emission in TDEs. Simultaneous X-ray data and modeling of the UV/optical emission suggest that some late radio outflows may be launched by a delayed phase of super-Eddington accretion onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while others may result from a state transition to a "low-hard" radiatively inefficient accretion flow or the deceleration of an off-axis relativistic jet. We additionally find weak statistical evidence that TDEs with delayed radio emission have larger optical/UV photospheric radii than other TDEs and are less likely to exhibit helium emission lines at early times, possibly also supporting the hypothesis that the onset of SMBH accretion is delayed in these systems. Our results have implications for our understanding of state changes in SMBH accretion flows, the circularization timescale for TDE debris, and the prevalence of off-axis jets in TDEs, and motivates systematic, long-term monitoring of these unique transients. The brightest objects in our sample are also detected in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), demonstrating that all-sky radio surveys can play an important role in discovering unexpected radio properties of the TDE population.</description>

      <title>Broadband Spectral Modeling of Blazars: Constraining the Lorentz Factor and Gamma-Ray Emission Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of a few blazars using multi-wavelength observations. Rapid flux variations are quantified via the doubling/halving timescale method, revealing the shortest variability timescales of a few hours in $\gamma$-ray emissions. The broadband fractional variability is systematically computed and examined as a function of frequency, displaying a characteristic double-hump structure akin to the typical spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars. To distinguish between different emission states, we utilize the Bayesian block algorithm, which effectively identifies distinct flux states for targeted spectral modeling. A one-zone leptonic emission framework is employed to model the broadband emission during these states. The minimum Doppler factors are estimated based on the shortest variability timescales observed in the $\gamma$-ray emissions. Under the external Compton scenario, we constrain the location of the gamma-ray emitting region and the Lorentz factor using three physical conditions: the upper limit on the jet collimation parameter, $\Gamma \theta &lt; 1$; the upper limit on the synchrotron self-Compton contribution, $L_{\mathrm{SSC}} \lesssim L_X$; and the observational constraint on the cooling break energy, $E_{\mathrm{cool, obs}} \lesssim 100$ MeV.</description>

Abstract: We present a search for spatio-temporal clusters in 16 years of Fermi-LAT very high-energy (VHE; $E&gt;100$ GeV) data using the DBSCAN algorithm, focusing on high Galactic latitude ($|b|&gt;10^{\circ}$) clusters with $\geq5$ events and transient doublets (two events within $\leq 3$ days). Of 107 detected clusters, two correspond to previously unidentified VHE sources: weak BL Lacertae objects 4FGL J0039.1-2219 and 4FGL J0212.2-0219, promising targets for next-generation VHE observatories. Due to low VHE photon background, even doublets with a duration of several days exhibited high statistical significance. While most of the 114 detected doublets originated from bright TeV emitters (e.g., Mrk 421, Mrk 501), we identified six VHE flares lacking TeVCat associations. Five of these flares correlate with sources from the Third Catalog of Fermi-LAT High-Energy Sources (3FHL), while one 'orphan' flare lacks a high-energy (HE; $E &gt; 10$ GeV) source counterpart. Some of these flares reached extreme luminosities of $\mathcal{O}(10^{47} \mathrm{erg~s^{-1}})$. No consistent temporal correlation emerged between HE and VHE activity: HE flares preceded, coincided with, or followed VHE emission across sources, with some showing no HE counterpart. Remarkably, 3FHL J0308.4+0408 (NGC 1218) is a Seyfert Type I galaxy, while no object of this class was known VHE emitter before. The 'orphan' flare without any known HE source in the vicinity may originate from NGC 5549, a low-luminosity LINER galaxy. Both sources expand the limited sample of non-blazar AGN detected at VHE energies.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Galactic cosmic rays: the influence of anisotropic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays in the large-scale Galactic magnetic field, where diffusion occurs at different rates along and across the magnetic field lines. To model this process, we use stochastic differential equations to describe cosmic ray propagation and solve them numerically. The Galactic magnetic field is modeled using the Jansson-Farrar prescription. In this study, we focus on the impact of perpendicular diffusion on the residence time of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. This allows us to estimate how anisotropic diffusion influences both the residence time and the total amount of matter (grammage) traversed by a typical cosmic ray during its journey through the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Gravity versus astrophysics in black hole images and photon rings: equatorial emissions and spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EHT collaboration released in 2019 the first horizon-scale images of a black hole accretion flow, opening a novel route for plasma physics comprehension and gravitational tests. Although the present unresolved images deeply depend on the astrophysical properties of the accreted matter, GR predicts that they contain highly lensed observables, the "photon rings", embodying the effects of strong-field gravity. Focusing on the supermassive black hole M87* and adopting a geometrically thin, equatorial disc as a phenomenological configuration for the accreting matter, our goal is to study the degeneracy of spacetime curvature and of physically-motivated emission processes on EHT-like images observed at 230 and 345 GHz. In a parametric framework, we simulate adaptively ray-traced images using GYOTO in various spherically-symmetric spacetime geometries, for a comprehensive class of disc velocities and realistic synchrotron emission profiles. We then extract the width and the peak position of 1D intensity cross sections on the direct image and the first photon ring. We show that, among the investigated quantities, the most appropriate observables to probe the geometry are the peak positions of the first photon ring. Small geometric deviations can be unequivocally detected, regardless of the motion of the disc, ranging from a Keplerian to a radially infalling one, if the black hole mass-to-distance estimate is accurate up to around 2%; the current uncertainty of 11% being sufficient just to access extreme deviations. The equatorial set-up of this paper, favoured by present EHT observations of M87*, is adapted to model future measurements at higher observing frequencies, where absorption effects are negligible, and with higher resolution, indispensable to resolve the photon rings. Additional work is needed to investigate if our conclusions hold for more realistic disc configurations.</description>

      <title>Fast Transitions of X-ray Variability in the Neutron Star Low Mass X-ray Binary Cygnus X-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral-timing analysis of two NICER observations of the weakly magnetized neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2. During these observations, we detect a rapid transition from a narrow 50-Hz horizontal-branch oscillation to a broad 5-Hz normal-branch oscillation, accompanied by an increase in source flux and a decrease in spectral hardness. Thanks to the large effective area of NICER, we are able to conduct a detailed comparison of the spectra associated with different types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on short timescales. By fitting the spectra with a model that includes a disc and Comptonization components plus two emission lines, we find that the parameters of the disc component do not change significantly during the transition. However, assuming a fixed electron temperature, the optical depth of the Comptonization component decreases significantly. This drop in optical depth may be attributed to the expansion of the boundary layer or spreading layer.In addition, we find that the rms spectra for both the HBO and NBO are hard, suggesting that the boundary layer or spreading layer is driving the variability. We discuss the potential physical origin of the different types of QPOs.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic magnetar magnetospheres in 3D with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetar phenomena are likely intertwined with the location and structure of magnetospheric currents. While general-relativistic effects may be important in shaping the force-free equilibria describing static configurations, most studies have been restricted to axial symmetry. Using a novel methodology based on physics-informed neural networks, fully three-dimensional configurations of varying stellar compactness are constructed. Realistic profiles for surface currents, qualitatively capturing the geometry of observed hotspots, are applied as boundary conditions to deduce the amount of free energy available to fuel outburst activity. It is found that the lowest-energy solution branches permit only a $\approx 30\%$ excess relative to current-starved solutions in axisymmetric cases with global twists, regardless of compactness, reducing to $\approx 5\%$ in 3D models with localised spots. Accounting for redshift reductions to their inferred dipole moments from timing data, explaining magnetar burst energetics therefore becomes more difficult unless the field hosts non-negligible multipoles. Discussions on other aspects of magnetar phenomena are also provided.</description>

      <title>Timing and spectral variability in 2S 1417-624 observed with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the spectral and timing analyses of the accreting X-ray pulsar, 2S 1417-624, during the 2018 and 2021 outbursts with Insight-HXMT. We find that the pulse profiles in all energy bands exhibit clear double-peaked structures at low flux states. In the 1-10 keV band, the pulse profiles evolve from double to triple peaks at a flux level of $\sim$4.1$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and from triple to quadruple peaks at $\sim$6.4$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. In the 10-30 keV and 30-100 keV bands, the pulse profiles become narrower at the first transition flux level, followed by a stark transition to quadruple-peaked and triple-peaked structures around the second flux level, respectively. The change of the pulse profile {during the second transition} reveals the transition of the emission pattern from the sub-critical (pencil beam) to the supercritical (fan beam) regime. By performing the binary orbital fitting of the observed spin periods, we provide new measurements of the orbital parameters from the 2021 outburst. Applying different accretion torque models and using the critical luminosity inferred from the pulse profile transitions, we derive a self-consistent distance of {2S 1417-624} in the range of approximately 12.0-15.0~kpc, based on the magnetic field strength derived from the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF). From the estimated distance of 13 kpc and Gaia's distance of 7.4 kpc, we can infer the observed transition luminosity of \((1.0-1.4) \times 10^{38} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}\) and \((3.0-5.0) \times 10^{37} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}\), respectively, and compare them with theoretical models. The spectral continuum parameters and the hardness ratio also show significant transitions around the second transition, strongly supporting a change in the accretion regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star travels too close to a supermassive black hole. In some cases, accretion of the disrupted material onto the black hole launches a relativistic jet. In this paper, we present a long term observing campaign to study the radio and sub-millimeter emission associated with the fifth jetted/relativistic TDE: AT2022cmc. Our campaign reveals a long lived counterpart. We fit three different models to our data: a non-thermal jet, a spherical outflow consisting of both thermal and non-thermal electrons, and a jet with thermal and non-thermal electrons. We find that the data is best described by a relativistic spherical outflow propagating into an environment with a density profile following R^-1.8. Comparison of AT2022cmc to other TDEs finds agreement in the density profile of the environment but also that AT2022cmc is twice as energetic as the other well-studied relativistic TDE Swift J1644. Our observations of AT2022cmc allow a thermal electron population to be inferred for the first time in a jetted transient providing, new insights into the microphysics of relativistic transients jets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantification of Observability and Equation of State of Twin Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the twin branch. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>A Halpha metric for identifying dormant black holes in X-ray transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dormant black holes (BHs) in X-ray transients can be identified by the presence of broad Ha emission lines from quiescent accretion discs. Unfortunately, short-period cataclysmic variables (CVs) can also produce broad Ha lines, especially when viewed at high inclinations, and are thus a major source of contamination. Here we compare the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and equivalent width (EW) of the Ha line in a sample of 20 quiescent BH transients and 354 CVs (305 from SDSS I to IV) with secure orbital periods (Porb) and find that: (1) FWHM and EW values decrease with Porb, and (2) for a given Porb both parameters are typically larger in BH transients than in CVs. We also compile spectral types for 17 low-mass companions in BH transients from the literature and derive an empirical Porb-Teff calibration. Using this, we conclude that the decrease in EW with Porb is mostly driven by the dilution of the Ha flux by the donor star continuum, which dominates the r-band spectrum for Porb&gt;~0.2 d. At shorter periods, the larger contribution of the disc to the total r-band flux introduces significant scatter in the EWs due to the changing visibility of the disc projected area with binary inclination. On the other hand, the larger EWs observed in BHs can be explained by their extreme mass ratios (which limit the fractional contribution of the companion to the total flux) and the absence of a white dwarf component (important at Porb&lt;~0.085 d). Finally, we present a tentative metric, based on Ha FWHM and EW information, and provide optimal cuts to select ~80 % of the BH X-ray transients, while rejecting ~78 % of the CVs in our sample. Such a metric, combined with other multi-frequency diagnostics, can help detect new dormant BH X-ray transients in blind large-scale surveys such as HaWKs and its pathfinder, Mini-HaWKs.</description>

      <title>JWST IFU observations uncover host galaxy continua in extremely red and obscured quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncovering bright quasars' host galaxies at cosmic noon is challenging because of the high contrast between the quasar and its host and redshifted light, making them primarily visible in the infrared. We present JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) observations of six extremely red quasars (ERQs) at $z=2.4-2.9$ and two dust-obscured quasars at lower redshifts. Using image decomposition across the spectral range, we successfully separate quasar and host galaxy continuum emission, model host morphologies, and extract spectra. The ERQs and obscured quasars have compact host galaxies with half-light radii of 1.4$-$2.9 kpc and stellar masses of 10$^{10.6-10.9}$ $M_{\odot}$. Their stellar masses are consistent with the average stellar mass of quasar hosts as expected from abundance matching and clustering analysis. Most of the quasars in our sample exhibit significant spatial offsets (0.4$-$1.3 kpc) between the quasar and host galaxy, potentially caused by post-merger dynamics or non-uniform dust obscuration. The ERQs reside 0.5$-$2 dex above the local black hole-stellar mass relation, similar to other heavily obscured populations such as HotDOGs, optically selected quasars at cosmic noon, and high-redshift SMBH candidates identified with JWST. However, this "over-massive" feature might be attributed to selection bias. Compared to HST-based studies, our JWST measurements reveal more compact host galaxies, smaller Sersic indices, and lower stellar masses, likely because of improved resolution, more accurate modeling, and minimal line contamination. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of JWST IFU in revealing quasar host galaxy properties and potential evolutionary stages of obscured quasars at cosmic noon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, hypothesized to be sufficiently light and/or weakly interacting, offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Their decay into three photons, referred to as the "dark photon trident" process, becomes the dominant channel when the dark photon mass lies below the electron pair production threshold. This decay channel produces a significant flux of x-rays, presenting an opportunity for indirect detection. In this study, we analyze 16 years of x-ray data from INTEGRAL/SPI to investigate sub-MeV dark photon decay. By incorporating state-of-the-art astrophysical background modeling and accounting for the full one-loop decay amplitude, we achieve world-leading constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter for dark photon masses in the range of 61-1022 keV. These results represent a significant improvement over previous constraints, narrowing the parameter space for viable dark photon dark matter models. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of x-ray observatories to probe unexplored regions of parameter space and pave the way for future searches using next-generation instruments designed to detect faint astrophysical signals.</description>

      <title>Effective Viscosity in the Intracluster Medium During Magnetic Field Amplification via Turbulent Dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters host a hot, diffuse plasma with poorly understood viscosity and magnetic field amplification. Astrophysical plasmas are often modeled with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but low collision rates in environments like the intracluster medium (ICM) hinder thermodynamic equilibrium, causing pressure anisotropies and high viscosity. High-$\beta$ plasmas, dominated by thermal pressure, are prone to instabilities (e.g., firehose, mirror) that limit anisotropy, reduce viscosity, and enable small-scale dynamo-driven magnetic amplification. This study examines viscosity evolution in the ICM during turbulent magnetic field amplification. We performed 3D MHD simulations of forced turbulence with an initially weak, uniform magnetic field. Using the CGL-MHD framework, we incorporate anisotropic pressure dynamics and instability-driven anisotropy limitation. We analyze effective viscosity and dynamo evolution, comparing results with Braginskii-MHD and uniform-viscosity MHD. Results show viscosity decreases over time, allowing magnetic field amplification to saturation levels similar to non-viscous MHD. Viscosity distribution becomes bimodal, reflecting (i) collisional values and (ii) turbulence-dominated values proportional to $10^{-4} L_{\rm turb} U_{\rm turb}$ in unstable regions. At saturation, 60% of plasma retains collisional viscosity. Braginskii-MHD reproduces similar magnetic amplification and viscosity structures. However, uniform-viscosity MHD, where viscosity equals the mean saturated CGL-MHD value, fails to capture the turbulence inertial range. These findings highlight the need for anisotropic viscosity models in studying ICM processes like magnetic topology, cosmic ray transport, and AGN-driven shocks. Moreover, our CGL-MHD and Braginskii-MHD models match the Coma cluster density fluctuation spectrum, reinforcing its weakly collisional nature.</description>

Abstract: A recent study on the dynamics of the quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the jet of BL~ Lacertae highlighted its significance in evaluating the physical properties of relativistic transverse waves in the parsec-scale jet. Motivated by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of 0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the 3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about $21\degr$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\approx 0.30\degr \pm 0.03\degr$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\overline{\beta_{\rm s}} \approx 15$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the QSC enables the classification and characterization of reversal patterns, which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave (abbrev.).</description>

      <title>Acceleration and Collimation of the Two-Sided Jets in the Nearby Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4261 (3C 270)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the acceleration and collimation of the two-sided jets in the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4261 (3C 270) using archival multifrequency, multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array data. By applying multiple analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we robustly identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and counterjet, with the transition occurring at $(1.23\pm0.24)\,$pc or $(8.1\pm1.6)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and $(0.97\pm0.29)\,$pc or $(6.4\pm1.9)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ for the counterjet. Assuming that the brightness asymmetry between the twin jets is primarily due to relativistic Doppler (de)boosting, we derive the jet velocity field at distances of $\sim (10^3-2\times10^4)\,R_{\rm s}$ based on the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio and spectral index. Although local kinematic variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic speeds from $\sim 10^3$ to $\sim8\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$, with a maximum Lorentz factor of $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx 2.6$. Beyond this region, the jet gradually decelerates to sub-relativistic speeds. These results support the existence of a (sub)parsec-scale ($\lesssim 1.5\,$pc) acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M 87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analogue of that in M 87.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the impact of the solar modulation on AMS-02 antiproton excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.</description>

      <title>Time integration for neutrino radiation transport using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems is dominated by the interaction between matter and radiation such as photons or neutrinos. The dynamics can be described by the evolution equations of radiation hydrodynamics in which reactions between matter particles and radiation quanta couples the hydrodynamic equations to those of radiative transfer (see Munier &amp; Weaver (1986a) and Munier &amp; Weaver (1986b)). The numerical treatment has to account for their potential stiffness (e.g., in optically thick environments). In this article, we will present a new method to numerically integrate these equations in a stable way by using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. With these methods, the inversion of the implicit operator can be done analytically, so the computational cost is equivalent to that of an explicit method. We strongly take into account the physical behavior of the evolved variables in the limit of the stiff regime in the derivation of the methods. We will show the results of applying these methods to the reactions between neutrinos and matter in some tests and also in realistic core-collapse supernovae simulations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Propagation Delays of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Long-lived Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the time delay incurred during ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) propagation over cosmological distances and its potential impact on the correlation between UHECR directions of arrival and long-lived sources (i.e., with duty cycles of order of Myr, such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and starburst galaxies), the UHECR chemical composition, and extragalactic magnetic field constraints. We propagate particles in different magnetic field configurations, spanning over an extended range of particle Larmor radii and magnetic field coherence lengths, also including attenuation losses. We conclude that UHECR delays could easily be comparable to (and longer than) AGN duty cycles, effectively erasing the correlation between known AGNs and UHECR anisotropies. We finally consider how strong constraints on the chemical composition of the heaviest UHECRs could enable a better characterization of extragalactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Cross-Comparison of Sampling Algorithms for Pulse Profile Modeling of PSR J0740+6620</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years, NICER data has enabled mass and radius inferences for various pulsars, and thus shed light on the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. This is achieved through a technique called pulse profile modeling. The importance of the results necessitates careful validation and testing of the robustness of the inference procedure. In this paper, we investigate the effect of sampler choice for X-PSI (X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference), an open-source package for pulse profile modeling and Bayesian statistical inference that has been used extensively for analysis of NICER data. We focus on the specific case of the high-mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620. Using synthetic data that mimics the most recently analyzed NICER and XMM-Newton data sets of PSR J0740+6620, we evaluate the parameter recovery performance, convergence, and computational cost for MultiNest's multimodal nested sampling algorithm and UltraNest's slice nested sampling algorithm. We find that both samplers perform reliably, producing accurate and unbiased parameter estimation results when analyzing simulated data. We also investigate the consequences for inference using the real data for PSR J0740+6620, finding that both samplers produce consistent credible intervals.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Kinematic Properties of Ejecta in SN1987A revealed by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-resolution spectra from the shock-heated plasmas in SN~1987A, based on an observation using the Resolve instrument onboard the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM).The 1.7--10 keV Resolve spectra are accurately represented by a single component, plane-parallel shock plasma model, with a temperature of $2.84_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$ keV and an ionization parameter of $2.64_{-0.45}^{+0.58} \times 10^{11}$ s cm$^{-3}$.The Resolve spectra are also well reproduced by the 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic simulation presented by Orlando et al. (2020) suggesting substantial contribution from the ejecta. The metal abundances obtained with Resolve align with the LMC value, indicating that the X-rays in 2024 originate from non-metal-rich shock-heated ejecta and the reverse shock has not reached the inner metal-rich region of ejecta. Doppler widths of the atomic lines from Si, S, and Fe correspond to velocities of 1,500--1,700 km s$^{-1}$, where the thermal broadening effects in this non-metal-rich plasma are negligible. Therefore, the line broadening seen in Resolve spectra is determined by the large bulk motion of ejecta. For reference, we determined a 90\% upper limit on non-thermal emission from a pulsar wind nebula at $4.3 \times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 2 -- 10 keV range, aligning with NuSTAR findings by Greco et al. (2022). Additionally, we searched for the $^{44}$Sc K line feature and found a $1\sigma$ upper limit of $1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which translates to an initial $^{44}$Ti mass of approximately $2 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot}$, consistent with previous X-ray to soft gamma-ray observations (Boggs et al. 2015; Grebenev et al. 2012; Leising 2006).</description>

      <title>Properties and microscopic structures of dense stellar matter in RMF models</title>

Abstract: Data tables on the equation of state (EOS) and microscopic structures for cold dense stellar matter with proton fractions $Y_p =0.01$-$0.65$ and baryon number densities $n_\text{b}=10^{-8}$-$2 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ are obtained adopting 13 different relativistic density functionals, i.e., NL3, PK1, PK1r, GM1, MTVTC, DD-LZ1, PKDD, DD-ME2, TW99, DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, and DD-MEY. The EOSs of dense stellar matter inside neutron stars with baryon number densities $n_\text{b}=7.6\times 10^{-11}$-$2 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ are obtained as well fulfilling $\beta$-stability condition. In general, the dense stellar matter exhibits droplet phase at $n_\mathrm{b}\lesssim 0.015\ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, while more exotic structures such as rods, slabs, tubes, and bubbles appear sequentially as density increases. The critical proton fractions $Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$ ($\approx 0.26$-0.31) for neutron drip are obtained, where neutron gas emerges outside of nuclei at $Y_p&lt; Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$. For dense stellar matter at small densities ($n_\text{b}\lesssim 10^{-5} \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$) or large proton fractions ($n_\text{b}\lesssim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and $Y_p\gtrsim Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$), the EOSs and microscopic structures are generally insensitive to the adopted density functionals. With the onset of neutron drip at $Y_p\lesssim Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$, the uncertainties emerge and peak at $n_\text{b} \approx 0.02 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ within the range $10^{-5} \lesssim n_\text{b}\lesssim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$. At $n_\text{b}\gtrsim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, the dense stellar matter becomes uniform and muons eventually appear, where the uncertainties in the EOSs grow significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that the time-reversal-even component of the pair production rate $\Gamma$ of particles in background fields in conformal 3+1 dimensional field theories is given by the anomalous trace $\langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle$ of the energy-momentum tensor: $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu} \rangle \Theta( \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. We show that this relation, written in mostly-plus metric, correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation of massless particles both in scalar and spinor versions of quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. The conjectured formula also reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 221502 (2023)]. A concurrent mechanism of the particle production due to the axial anomaly is briefly discussed and critical remarks on the state-dependence are also given.</description>

      <title>Suppressed accretion onto massive black hole binaries surrounded by thin disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming begins in the UV/optical and could completely choke high-energy emission, such that these systems would likely be intrinsically X-ray weak with reddened continua, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Determining parameters of Kerr-Newman black holes by shadow observation from finite distance and spatial infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the physical parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole through shadow observation. In a system comprising a Kerr-Newman black hole, an observer, and a light source, the relevant parameters are mass $M$, specific angular momentum $a$, electric charge $Q$, inclination angle $i$, and distance $r_o$. We consider the cases where the observer is at either a finite distance or spatial infinity. Using our method, the dimensionless parameters $(a/M, Q/M, i)$ can be determined by observing the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole from spatial infinity. We analytically prove that the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole observed from spatial infinity is unique, where uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent shadow contours for distinct sets of dimensionless parameter values. This method is versatile and can be applied to a range of black hole solutions with charge. Additionally, we show analytically that the shadow contour of a Kerr-Newman black hole observed from a finite distance $r_o$ is not unique, meaning that the parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distance cannot be determined from shadow observations. This result reveals a new challenge and provides a clear direction for further research on black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals in Milky Way Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consequence of a non-zero occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies is that these MBHs can become residents of larger galaxy halos via hierarchical merging and tidal stripping. Depending on the parameters of their orbits and original hosts, some of these MBHs will merge with the central supermassive black hole in the larger galaxy. We examine four cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies to study the demographics of the black hole mergers which originate from dwarf galaxies. Approximately half of these mergers have mass ratios less than 0.04, which we categorize as intermediate mass ratio inspirals, or IMRIs. Inspiral durations range from 0.5 - 8 Gyr, depending on the compactness of the dwarf galaxy. Approximately half of the inspirals may become more circular with time, while the eccentricity of the remainder does not evolve. Overall, IMRIs in Milky Way-like galaxies are a significant class of black hole merger that can be detected by LISA, and must be prioritized for waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter, and the science potential will be greatly enhanced by the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, which are expected to detect BNS signals with order-of-magnitude improvements in duration, detection rates, and signal strength. However, the resulting computational demands for analyzing such prolonged signals pose a critical challenge that existing Bayesian methods cannot feasibly address in the 3G era. To bridge this critical gap, we demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compression of the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inference that can deliver results in seconds. The optimized computational cost of BNS signal analysis with our framework shows that machine learning has the potential to be an indispensable tool for future catalog-level BNS analyses, paving the way for large-scale investigations of BNS-related physics across the 3G observational landscape.</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures beyond Newton: exploring hierarchical three-body dynamics</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical three-body systems offer a compelling framework to explore the subtle interplay between Newtonian and relativistic gravitational effects in astrophysical environments. In this work, we investigate post-Newtonian corrections to the periastron shift within such systems, focusing on the impact of orbital eccentricity and relativistic modifications to the center of mass. Modeling the secondary body's influence as a quadrupolar perturbation, we rigorously compare Newtonian, Schwarzschild, and post-Newtonian quadrupolar contributions to orbital precession. Our analysis demonstrates that Newtonian quadrupolar effects could be observable in the orbit of the S87 star around Sagittarius A* if an intermediate-mass black hole is present. Additionally, post-Newtonian quadrupolar corrections, though subtle, may notably influence the dynamics of small Solar System bodies in the presence of massive companions. These findings provide critical insights into detecting relativistic corrections in astrophysical systems with current high-precision instruments, such as GRAVITY. By bridging classical and relativistic dynamics, this study enhances our understanding of gravitational interactions in multi-body systems and paves the way for testing general relativity in the complex gravitational fields of galactic nuclei and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Dyonic regular black bounce solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores dyonic black bounce (BB) solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields (SFs). Previous research has employed NLED and SFs to obtain BB solutions in GR; however, these solutions typically assume the presence of either magnetic monopoles or electric charges exclusively as components of the Maxwell-Faraday tensor. In this study, we examine static and spherically symmetric BB solutions that incorporate both magnetic and electric components, forming what are known as dyon solutions. A dyon is a particle characterized by the coexistence of both magnetic and electric charges. We determine the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential that produce these solutions and analyze the associated gravitational configurations, focusing on horizons, the behavior of the metric function, and spacetime regularity as described by the Kretschmann scalar. Notably, we present the first BB solution derived from the coupling of a linear electromagnetic Lagrangian and a scalar field with an associated potential as the matter source. This work broadens the class of non-singular geometries in the literature and opens new avenues for investigating dyonic BB solutions within the context of other modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Origin of the lunar inclination from tidal interaction of multiple-moon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by Theia colliding with proto-Earth and the predicted lunar orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equatorial plane is about within one degree when Moon formed. However, the current lunar orbital inclination with five degrees relative to the Earth's orbital plane requires the Moon's orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equator to be about ten degrees when traced back to the time of lunar formation. Since two moons are also a natural outcome of simulations of lunar formation from a protolunar disk produced a giant impact, here we show that, under solar perturbation, gravitational tidal interaction between Earth and the two moons with orbital inclination of one degree relative to Earth's equatorial plane could lead to the merger of one moon with Earth, or the merger of the two moons or the ejection of one moon, resulting that the remaining moon's orbital inclination relative to Earth's equator could exceed 10 degrees. The theory proposed here may provide a way of explaining the initial large lunar inclination relative to the Earth's equator.</description>

      <title>Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731</link>

Abstract: Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of the remarkable galaxy group Nest200047</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.</description>
