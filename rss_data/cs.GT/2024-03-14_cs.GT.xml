      <title>Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of the Q-learning algorithm (a classical and widely used reinforcement learning method) to strategic manipulation of sophisticated opponents in games. We quantify how much a strategically sophisticated agent can exploit a naive Q-learner if she knows the opponent's Q-learning algorithm. To this end, we formulate the strategic actor's problem as a Markov decision process (with a continuum state space encompassing all possible Q-values) as if the Q-learning algorithm is the underlying dynamical system. We also present a quantization-based approximation scheme to tackle the continuum state space and analyze its performance both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Language-based game theory in the age of artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human behaviour in decision problems and strategic interactions has wide-ranging applications in economics, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Game theory offers a robust foundation for this understanding, based on the idea that individuals aim to maximize a utility function. However, the exact factors influencing strategy choices remain elusive. While traditional models try to explain human behaviour as a function of the outcomes of available actions, recent experimental research reveals that linguistic content significantly impacts decision-making, thus prompting a paradigm shift from outcome-based to language-based utility functions. This shift is more urgent than ever, given the advancement of generative AI, which has the potential to support humans in making critical decisions through language-based interactions. We propose sentiment analysis as a fundamental tool for this shift and take an initial step by analyzing 61 experimental instructions from the dictator game, an economic game capturing the balance between self-interest and the interest of others, which is at the core of many social interactions. Our meta-analysis shows that sentiment analysis can explain human behaviour beyond economic outcomes. We discuss future research directions. We hope this work sets the stage for a novel game theoretical approach that emphasizes the importance of language in human decisions.</description>

      <title>All-pay Auction Based Profit Maximization in End-to-End Computation Offloading System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pricing is an important issue in mobile edge computing. How to appropriately determine the bid of end user (EU) is an incentive factor for edge cloud (EC) to offer service. In this letter, we propose an equilibrium pricing scheme based on the all-pay auction model in end-to-end collaboration environment, wherein all EUs can acquire the service at a lower price than the own value of the required resource. In addition, we propose a set allocation algorithm to divide all the bidders into different sets according to the price, and the EUs in each set get the service, which averts the case of getting no service due to the low price. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively maximize the total profit of the edge offloading system, and guarantee all EUs can access the service.</description>

      <title>Sequential Contracts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the principal-agent setting, where a principal delegates the execution of a costly project to an agent. In the classical model, the agent chooses an action among a set of available actions. Every action is associated with some cost, and leads to a stochastic outcome for the project. The agent's action is hidden from the principal, who only observes the outcome. The principal incentivizes the agent through a payment scheme (a contract) that maps outcomes to payments, with the objective of finding the optimal contract - the contract maximizing the principal's expected utility.
  In this work, we introduce a sequential variant of the model, capturing many real-life settings, where the agent engages in multiple attempts, incurring the sum of costs of the actions taken and being compensated for the best realized outcome. We study the contract design problem in this new setting. We first observe that the agent's problem - finding the sequential set of actions that maximizes his utility for a given contract - is equivalent to the well-known Pandora's Box problem. With this insight at hand, we provide algorithms and hardness results for the (principal's) contract design problem, under both independent and correlated actions. For independent actions, we show that the optimal linear contract can be computed in polynomial time. Furthermore, this result extends to the optimal arbitrary contract when the number of outcomes is a constant. For correlated actions we find that approximating the optimal contract within any constant ratio is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Model-free Resilient Controller Design based on Incentive Feedback Stackelberg Game and Q-learning</title>

Abstract: In the swift evolution of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) within intelligent environments, especially in the industrial domain shaped by Industry 4.0, the surge in development brings forth unprecedented security challenges. This paper explores the intricate security issues of Industrial CPSs (ICPSs), with a specific focus on the unique threats presented by intelligent attackers capable of directly compromising the controller, thereby posing a direct risk to physical security. Within the framework of hierarchical control and incentive feedback Stackelberg game, we design a resilient leading controller (leader) that is adaptive to a compromised following controller (follower) such that the compromised follower acts cooperatively with the leader, aligning its strategies with the leader's objective to achieve a team-optimal solution. First, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of an incentive Stackelberg solution when system dynamics are known. Then, we propose a Q-learning-based Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) approach, and corresponding algorithms for the online resolution of the incentive Stackelberg solution without requiring prior knowledge of system dynamics. Last but not least, we prove the convergence of our approach to the optimum.</description>

      <title>Trust AI Regulation? Discerning users are vital to build trust and effective AI regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is general agreement that some form of regulation is necessary both for AI creators to be incentivised to develop trustworthy systems, and for users to actually trust those systems. But there is much debate about what form these regulations should take and how they should be implemented. Most work in this area has been qualitative, and has not been able to make formal predictions. Here, we propose that evolutionary game theory can be used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by users, AI creators, and regulators, and provide insights into the possible effects of different regulatory regimes. We show that creating trustworthy AI and user trust requires regulators to be incentivised to regulate effectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of two mechanisms that can achieve this. The first is where governments can recognise and reward regulators that do a good job. In that case, if the AI system is not too risky for users then some level of trustworthy development and user trust evolves. We then consider an alternative solution, where users can condition their trust decision on the effectiveness of the regulators. This leads to effective regulation, and consequently the development of trustworthy AI and user trust, provided that the cost of implementing regulations is not too high. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the effect of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Diversity-seeking Jump Games in Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, strategic games inspired by Schelling's influential model of residential segregation have been studied in the TCS and AI literature. In these games, agents of k different types occupy the nodes of a network topology aiming to maximize their utility, which is a function of the fraction of same-type agents they are adjacent to in the network. As such, the agents exhibit similarity seeking strategic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a class of strategic jump games in which the agents are diversity-seeking: The utility of an agent is defined as the fraction of its neighbors that are of different type than itself. We show that in general it is computationally hard to determine the existence of an equilibrium in such games. However, when the network is a tree, diversity-seeking jump games always admit an equilibrium assignment. For regular graphs and spider graphs with a single empty node, we prove a stronger result: The game is potential, that is, the improving response dynamics always converge to an equilibrium from any initial placement of the agents. We also show (nearly tight) bounds on the price of anarchy and price of stability in terms of the social welfare (the total utility of the agents).</description>

      <title>Prosumers Participation in Markets: A Scalar-Parameterized Function Bidding Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In uniform-price markets, suppliers compete to supply a resource to consumers, resulting in a single market price determined by their competition. For sufficient flexibility, producers and consumers prefer to commit to a function as their strategies, indicating their preferred quantity at any given market price. Producers and consumers may wish to act as both, i.e., prosumers. In this paper, we examine the behavior of profit-maximizing prosumers in a uniform-price market for resource allocation with the objective of maximizing the social welfare. We propose a scalar-parameterized function bidding mechanism for the prosumers, in which we establish the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we provide an efficient way to compute the Nash equilibrium through the computation of the market allocation at the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we present a case study to illustrate the welfare loss under different variations of market parameters, such as the market's supply capacity and inelastic demand.</description>

Abstract: We propose the first loss function for approximate Nash equilibria of normal-form games that is amenable to unbiased Monte Carlo estimation. This construction allows us to deploy standard non-convex stochastic optimization techniques for approximating Nash equilibria, resulting in novel algorithms with provable guarantees. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments demonstrating that stochastic gradient descent can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Data Monetization Pathways and Complex Dynamic Game Equilibrium Analysis in the Energy Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the most critical production factor in the era of the digital economy, data will have a significant impact on social production and development. Energy enterprises possess data that is interconnected with multiple industries, characterized by diverse needs, sensitivity, and long-term nature. The path to monetizing energy enterprises' data is challenging yet crucial. This paper explores the game-theoretic aspects of the data monetization process in energy enterprises by considering the relationships between enterprises and trading platforms. We construct a class of game decision models and study their equilibrium strategies. Our analysis shows that enterprises and platforms can adjust respective benefits by regulating the wholesale price of data and the intensity of data value mining to form a benign equilibrium state. Furthermore, by integrating nonlinear dynamical theory, we discuss the dynamic characteristics present in multi-period repeated game processes. We find that decision-makers should keep the adjustment parameters and initial states within reasonable ranges in multi-period dynamic decision-making to avoid market failure. Finally, based on the theoretical and numerical analysis, we provide decision insights and recommendations for enterprise decision-making to facilitate data monetization through strategic interactions with trading platforms.</description>

      <title>Expected flow networks in stochastic environments and two-player zero-sum games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are sequential sampling models trained to match a given distribution. GFlowNets have been successfully applied to various structured object generation tasks, sampling a diverse set of high-reward objects quickly. We propose expected flow networks (EFlowNets), which extend GFlowNets to stochastic environments. We show that EFlowNets outperform other GFlowNet formulations in stochastic tasks such as protein design. We then extend the concept of EFlowNets to adversarial environments, proposing adversarial flow networks (AFlowNets) for two-player zero-sum games. We show that AFlowNets learn to find above 80% of optimal moves in Connect-4 via self-play and outperform AlphaZero in tournaments.</description>
