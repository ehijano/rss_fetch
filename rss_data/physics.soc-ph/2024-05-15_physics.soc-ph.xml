      <title>Nonequilibrium phase transitions and absorbing states in a model for the dynamics of religious affiliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model to describe the dynamics of religious affiliation. For such purpose, we built a compartmental model with three distinct subpopulations, namely religious committed individuals, religious noncommitted individuals and not religious affiliated individuals. The transitions among the compartments are governed by probabilities, modeling social interactions among the groups and also spontaneous transitions among the compartments. First of all, we consider the model on a fully-connected network. Thus, we write a set of ordinary differential equations to study the evolution of the subpopulations. Our analytical and numerical results show that there is an absorbing state in the model where only one of the subpopulations survive in the long-time limit. There are also regions of parameters where some of the subpopulations coexist (two or three). We also verified the occurrence of two distinct critical points. In addition, we also present Monte Carlo simulations of the model on two-dimensional square lattices, in order to analyze the impact of the presence of a lattice structure on the critical behavior of the model. Comparison of the models' results with data for religious affiliation in Northern Ireland shows a good qualitative agreement. Finally, we considered the presence of inflexible individuals in the population, i.e., individuals that never change their states. The impact of such special agents on the critical behavior of the model is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A universal optimization framework based on cycle ranking for influence maximization in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence maximization aims to identify a set of influential individuals, referred to as influencers, as information sources to maximize the spread of information within networks, constituting a vital combinatorial optimization problem with extensive practical applications and sustained interdisciplinary interest. Diverse approaches have been devised to efficiently address this issue, one of which involves selecting the influencers from a given centrality ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework based on ranking basic cycles in networks, capable of selecting the influencers from diverse centrality measures. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to directly selecting the top-k nodes from centrality sequences and other state-of-the-art optimization approaches, the new framework can expand the dissemination range by 1.5 to 3 times. Counterintuitively, it exhibits minimal hub property, with the average distance between influencers being only one-third of alternative approaches, regardless of the centrality metrics or network types. Our study not only paves the way for novel strategies in influence maximization but also underscores the unique potential of underappreciated cycle structures.</description>

      <title>The Small-World Effect for Interferometer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex network theory has focused on properties of networks with real-valued edge weights. However, in signal transfer networks, such as those representing the transfer of light across an interferometer, complex-valued edge weights are needed to represent the manipulation of the signal in both magnitude and phase. These complex-valued edge weights introduce interference into the signal transfer, but it is unknown how such interference affects network properties such as small-worldness. To address this gap, we have introduced a small-world interferometer network model with complex-valued edge weights and generalized existing network measures to define the interferometric clustering coefficient, the apparent path length, and the interferometric small-world coefficient. Using high-performance computing resources, we generated a large set of small-world interferometers over a wide range of parameters in system size, nearest-neighbor count, and edge-weight phase and computed their interferometric network measures. We found that the interferometric small-world coefficient depends significantly on the amount of phase on complex-valued edge weights: for small edge-weight phases, constructive interference led to a higher interferometric small-world coefficient; while larger edge-weight phases induced destructive interference which led to a lower interferometric small-world coefficient. Thus, for the small-world interferometer model, interferometric measures are necessary to capture the effect of interference on signal transfer. This model is an example of the type of problem that necessitates interferometric measures, and applies to any wave-based network including quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spatial segmentation of housing markets from online listings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real estate market shows an inherent connection to space. Real estate agencies unevenly operate and specialize across space, price and type of properties, thereby segmenting the market into submarkets. We introduce here a methodology based on multipartite networks to detect the spatial segmentation emerging from data on housing online listings. Considering the spatial information of the listings, we build a bipartite network that connects agencies and spatial units. This bipartite network is projected into a network of spatial units, whose connections account for similarities in the agency ecosystem. We then apply clustering methods to this network to segment markets into spatially-coherent regions, which are found to be robust across different clustering detection algorithms, discretization of space and spatial scales, and across countries with case studies in France and Spain. This methodology addresses the long-standing issue of housing market segmentation, relevant in disciplines such as urban studies and spatial economics, and with implications for policymaking.</description>

      <title>On the implementation of zero-determinant strategies in repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we further deepen our understanding on general mathematical properties of zero-determinant strategies. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These results assist us to implement zero-determinant strategies in broader situations.</description>
