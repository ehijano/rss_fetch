      <title>Zeros of orthogonal little q-Jacobi polynomials: interlacing and monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of zeros of the little q-Jacobi polynomials and related q-hypergeometric families. We prove that the zeros of these orthogonal polynomials exhibit strong interlacing properties and obey natural monotonicity rules with respect to the parameters. A key tool in our approach is the logarithmic mesh, which quantifies the relative spacing of the positive real zeros and allows us to classify families of polynomials with prescribed interlacing patterns. Our results include new interlacing relations, monotonicity with respect to parameters, and structural decompositions in non-orthogonal regimes. Several classical families of q-hypergeometric polynomials, including q-Bessel and Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials, are treated as limit cases. The methods rely on a combination of classical orthogonality theory and q-difference equations.</description>

      <title>Random Constructions for Sharp Estimates of Mizohata-Takeuchi Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Mizohata-Takeuchi type estimate is a type of weighted Fourier restriction estimate. Using tools from high dimensional probability, we construct a large class of weights that satisfy sharp estimates of Mizohata-Takeuchi type. One can interpret our result as saying that with high probability, a generic weight satisfies a sharp inequality of Mizohata-Takeuchi type (up to an epsilon-loss).</description>

      <title>Elliptic asymptotic behaviour of $q$-Painlev\'e transcendents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete Painlev\'e equations have mathematical properties closely related to those of the differential Painlev\'e equations. We investigate the appearance of elliptic functions as limiting behaviours of $q$-Painlev\'e transcendents, analogous to the asymptotic theory of classical Painlev\'e transcendents. We focus on the $q$-difference second Painlev\'e equation in the asymptotic regime $|q-1|\ll1$, showing that generic leading-order behaviour is given in terms of elliptic functions and that the slow modulation in this behaviour is approximated in terms of complete elliptic integrals.</description>

      <title>Characterizations for arbitrary B\'ekoll\'e-Bonami weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We precisely characterize the relationships between the reverse H\"older inequality, the Fujii-Wilson condition, the B\'ekoll\'e-Bonami $\mathrm{B}_p$ condition, the $\mathrm{B}_\infty$ condition, and the reverse Jensen inequality, for arbitrary weights in the unit disc. This is achieved by introducing new side conditions that turn out to be necessary and sufficient. The side conditions are simple and testable, and can be interpreted as integral versions of the much stronger condition of bounded hyperbolic oscillation, which has been considered earlier in the literature.</description>

      <title>Deformations of OP ensembles in a bulk critical scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study orthogonal polynomial ensembles whose weights are deformations of exponential weights, in the limit of a large number of particles. The deformation symbols we consider affect local fluctuations of the ensemble around a bulk point of the limiting spectrum. We identify the limiting kernel in terms of a solution to an integrable non-local differential equation. This novel kernel is the correlation kernel of a conditional thinned process starting from the Sine point process, and it is also related to a finite temperature deformation of the Sine kernel as recently studied by Claeys and Tarricone. We also unravel the effect of the deformation on the recurrence coefficients of the associated orthogonal polynomials, which display oscillatory behavior even in a one-cut regular situation for the limiting spectrum.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cucker-Smale Networks: Limiting Laplacian Time-Varying Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differences in opinion can be seen as distances between individuals, and such differences do not always vanish over time. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework that captures the formation of opinion clusters, based on extensions of the Cucker Smale and Hegselmann Krause models to a combined adaptive (or co-evolutionary) network. Reducing our model to a singular limit of fast adaptation, we mathematically analyze the asymptotic behavior of the resulting Laplacian dynamics over various classes of temporal graphs and use these results to explain the behavior of the original proposed adaptive model for fast adaptation. In particular, our approach provides a general methodology for analyzing linear consensus models over time-varying networks that naturally arise as singular limits in many adaptive network models.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and dimensions of fractal Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in number theory, analysis, and fractal geometry, we consider regularity properties and dimensions of graphs associated with Fourier series of the form $F(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)e^{2\pi i nt}/n$, for a large class of coefficient functions $f$. Our main result states that if, for some constants $C$ and $\alpha$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, we have $|\sum_{1\le n\le x}f(n)e^{2\pi i nt}|\le C x^{\alpha}$ uniformly in $x\ge 1$ and $t\in \mathbb{R}$, then the series $F(t)$ is H\"older continuous with exponent $1-\alpha$, and the graph of $|F(t)|$ on the interval $[0,1]$ has box-counting dimension $\leq 1+\alpha$. As applications we recover the best-possible uniform H\"older exponents for the Weierstrass functions $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a^k\cos(2\pi b^k t)$ and the Riemann function $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin(\pi n^2 t)/n^2$. Moreoever, under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we obtain nontrivial bounds for H\"older exponents and dimensions associated with series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(n)e^{2\pi i n^kt}/n^k$, where $\mu$ is the M\"obius function.</description>

      <title>Generalized product formulas for Whittaker's functions and a novel class of index transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized product formulas and index transforms, involving products of Whittaker's functions of different indices are established and investigated. The corresponding inversion formulas are found. Particular cases cover index transforms with products of the modified Bessel and Whittaker's functions. For our goals the Kontorovich-Lebedev and Olevskii transforms of a complex index with nonzero real part are involved.</description>

      <title>Tracking controllability for finite-dimensional linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a functional analytic framework for tracking controllability in finite-dimensional linear systems. By leveraging the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM) and duality principles, we rigorously characterize tracking controllability through a non-standard observability inequality for the adjoint system. This enables the synthesis of minimum-norm tracking controls while revealing novel regularity requirements that depend intricately on system structure and the projection operator. Our approach generalizes classical concepts, embedding them in an energy-minimization context that extends functional output controllability and invertibility. Explicit control constructions in the scalar case illustrate these principles, and numerical experiments validate the approach for both smooth and non-smooth targets.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for a class of planar orthogonal polynomials and truncated unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out the asymptotic analysis as $n \to \infty$ of a class of orthogonal polynomials $p_{n}(z)$ of degree $n$, defined with respect to the planar measure \begin{equation*} d\mu(z) = (1-|z|^{2})^{\alpha-1}|z-x|^{\gamma}\mathbf{1}_{|z| &lt; 1}d^{2}z, \end{equation*} where $d^{2}z$ is the two dimensional area measure, $\alpha$ is a parameter that can grow with $n$, while $\gamma&gt;-2$ and $x&gt;0$ are fixed. This measure arises naturally in the study of characteristic polynomials of non-Hermitian ensembles and generalises the example of a Gaussian weight that was recently studied by several authors. We obtain asymptotics in all regions of the complex plane and via an appropriate differential identity, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the partition function. The main approach is to convert the planar orthogonality to one defined on suitable contours in the complex plane. Then the asymptotic analysis is performed using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>
