      <title>Dolphin: An Actor-Oriented Database for Reactive Moving Object Data Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel reactive moving object applications require solutions to support object reactive behaviors as a way to query and update dynamic data. While moving object scenarios have long been researched in the context of spatio-temporal data management, reactive behavior is usually left to complex end-user implementations. However, it is not just a matter of hardwiring reactive constraints: the required solutions need to satisfy tight low-latency computation requirements and be scalable. This paper explores a novel approach to enrich a distributed actor-based framework with reactive functionality and complex spatial data management along with concurrency semantics. Our approach relies on a proposal of the moving actor abstraction, which is a conceptual enhancement of the actor model with reactive sensing, movement, and spatial querying capabilities. This enhancement helps developers of reactive moving object applications avoid the significant burden of implementing application-level schemes to balance performance and consistency. Based on moving actors, we define a reactive moving object data management platform, named Moving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs), and build Dolphin -- an implementation of M-AODBs. Dolphin embodies a non-intrusive actor-based design layered on top of the Microsoft Orleans distributed virtual actor framework. In a set of experimental evaluations with realistic reactive moving object scenarios, Dolphin exhibits scalability on multi-machines and provides near-real-time reaction latency.</description>

      <title>CityVerse: A Unified Data Platform for Multi-Task Urban Computing with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for urban computing, from spatial reasoning to predictive analytics. However, evaluating LLMs across diverse urban tasks faces two critical challenges: lack of unified platforms for consistent multi-source data access and fragmented task definitions that hinder fair comparison. To address these challenges, we present CityVerse, the first unified platform integrating multi-source urban data, capability-based task taxonomy, and dynamic simulation for systematic LLM evaluation in urban contexts. CityVerse provides: 1) coordinate-based Data APIs unifying ten categories of urban data-including spatial features, temporal dynamics, demographics, and multi-modal imagery-with over 38 million curated records; 2) Task APIs organizing 43 urban computing tasks into a four-level cognitive hierarchy: Perception, Spatial Understanding, Reasoning and Prediction, and Decision and Interaction, enabling standardized evaluation across capability levels; 3) an interactive visualization frontend supporting real-time data retrieval, multi-layer display, and simulation replay for intuitive exploration and validation. We validate the platform's effectiveness through evaluations on mainstream LLMs across representative tasks, demonstrating its capability to support reproducible and systematic assessment. CityVerse provides a reusable foundation for advancing LLMs and multi-task approaches in the urban computing domain.</description>

      <title>DemoTuner: Efficient DBMS Knobs Tuning via LLM-Assisted Demonstration Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.</description>

      <title>Text2SQL-Flow: A Robust SQL-Aware Data Augmentation Framework for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.</description>

      <title>DatAasee -- A Metadata-Lake as Metadata Catalog for a Virtual Data-Lake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metadata management for distributed data sources is a long-standing but ever-growing problem. To counter this challenge in a research-data and library-oriented setting, this work constructs a data architecture, derived from the data-lake: the metadata-lake. A proof-of-concept implementation of this proposed metadata aggregator is presented, too, and also evaluated.</description>

      <title>BS-tree: A gapped data-parallel B-tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose BS-tree, an in-memory implementation of the B+-tree that adopts the structure of the disk-based index (i.e., a balanced, multiway tree), setting the node size to a memory block that can be processed fast and in parallel using SIMD instructions. A novel feature of the BS-tree is that it enables gaps (unused positions) within nodes by duplicating key values. This allows (i) branchless SIMD search within each node, and (ii) branchless update operations in nodes without key shifting. We implement a frame of reference (FOR) compression mechanism, which allows nodes to have varying capacities, and can greatly decrease the memory footprint of BS-tree. We compare our approach to existing main-memory indices and learned indices under different workloads of queries and updates and demonstrate its robustness and superiority compared to previous work in single- and multi-threaded processing.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Text-to-SQL: Dynamic Multi-turn SQL Interaction for Real-world Database Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static, single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation. Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database. The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change. DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling 1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .</description>
