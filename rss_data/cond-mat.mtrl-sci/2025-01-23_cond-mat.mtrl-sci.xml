      <title>How to Measure and Model Light-Induced Spin Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser light can transfer spin angular momentum between magnetic subspecies that exhibit hybridized valence bands within an alloy or compound, and represents the fastest route for manipulating the magnetization of a material. To date, ultrafast spin transfer has predominantly been explained in terms of the initial and final states available for laser excitation. Here, by comparing the measured and calculated dynamics across the entire $M$-edges of two very similar Heusler compounds, $Co_2MnGa$ and $Co_2MnGe$ as well as a sample of elemental Co, we find that simply accounting for the initial and final electron states available for laser excitation cannot alone explain the experimental observations. The influence of spin lifetimes must also be included, due to the shifting of the Fermi level upon replacing Ga with Ge, or the presence of crystalline disorder. This explains why the ordered $L2_1$ phase of $Co_2MnGa$ demonstrates strong laser-induced magnetic signal enhancements across the entire Co-edge, while similar enhancements were not observed in partially disordered $Co_2MnGe$. Although intra-site spin-transfers were expected in the minority channel in pure Co due to the presence of many more available states in the minority channel above the Fermi level, no such signal was observed due to very short few-femtosecond spin lifetimes in a metal. Finally, we identify key regions in the magnetic asymmetry where a transiently enhanced signal could be misinterpreted as a light-induced spin-transfer signature.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning electronic structure: millielectron volt accuracy for sub-million-atom moir\'e semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of density functional theory (DFT) with machine learning enables efficient \textit{ab initio} electronic structure calculations for ultra-large systems. In this work, we develop a transfer learning framework tailored for long-wavelength moir\'e systems. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we adopt a two-step transfer learning strategy: (1) the model is pre-trained on a large dataset of computationally inexpensive non-twisted structures until convergence, and (2) the network is then fine-tuned using a small set of computationally expensive twisted structures. Applying this method to twisted MoTe$_2$, the neural network model generates the resulting Hamiltonian for a 1000-atom system in 200 seconds, achieving a mean absolute error below 0.1 meV. To demonstrate $O(N)$ scalability, we model nanoribbon systems with up to 0.25 million atoms ($\sim9$ million orbitals), accurately capturing edge states consistent with predicted Chern numbers. This approach addresses the challenges of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, offering a viable alternative to conventional DFT and enabling the exploration of electronic topology in large scale moir\'e systems towards simulating realistic device architectures.</description>

      <title>Effect of Pt bottom electrode texture selection on the tetragonality and physical properties of Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 thin films produced by pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of platinum (Pt) bottom electrode texture on the tetragonality, dielectric, ferroelectric, and polarization switching response of pulsed laser deposited Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 (BST) thin films has been studied. The x-ray diffraction and Raman analysis revealed the higher tetragonality of BST films when they were grown on higher (111) textured Pt layer. The properties like dielectric permittivity, polarization, switching time, and leakage currents were found to be correlated to tetragonality and orientation of the BST films. The polarization current was observed to be higher in BST films on Pt epitaxial layer and it exhibits exponential dependence on the electric field. The voltage-current measurements displayed Ohmic behavior of leakage current irrespective of Pt texture for low voltages (up to 1 V), whereas at higher voltages the conduction mechanism was found to be dependent on texture selection of bottom Pt electrode.</description>

      <title>Self-assembling of Ge quantum dots in an alumina matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we report on a self-assembled growth of a Ge quantum dot lattice in a single 600-nm-thick Ge+Al2O3 layer during magnetron sputtering deposition of a Ge+Al2O3 mixture at an elevated substrate temperature. The self-assembly results in the formation of a well-ordered threedimensional body-centered tetragonal quantum dot lattice within the whole deposited volume. The quantum dots formed are very small in size less than 4.0 nm, have a narrow size distribution and a large packing density. The parameters of the quantum dot lattice can be tuned by changing the deposition parameters. The self-ordering of the quantum dots is explained by diffusionmediated nucleation and surface-morphology effects and simulated by a kinetic Monte Carlo model.</description>

      <title>Structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu compounds characterized by a neural-network-based potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) compounds are widely utilized in various industrial fields due to their exceptional mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a neural-network-based deep potential (DP) model that covers a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 0 to 3,000 K, and pressures, varying from 0 to 10 GPa. This study presents a model trained using density functional theory data for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we systematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu alloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's modulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content increases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu concentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical strain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile transition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. % Cu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal that Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while promoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region. The above results from the DP model are anticipated to aid in exploring the physical mechanisms underlying the complex phenomena of W-Cu systems and contribute to the advancement of methodologies for materials simulation.</description>

      <title>Tuning the topological winding number by rolling up graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscrolls, radial superlattices formed by rolling up a nanomembrane, exhibit distinct electronic and magneto-transport properties compared to their flat counterparts. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that the conductance can be precisely enhanced N times by rolling up graphene into an N-turn nanoscroll and applying a longitudinal magnetic field. This tunable positive magnetoconductance stems from the topological winding number which is activated in a carbon nanoscroll with magnetic flux and its maximum value purely increases with the scroll winding number (the number of turns). By integrating material geometry and topology, our work opens the door to artificially creating, customizing, and designing topological materials in rolled-up graphene-like systems.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in undoped HfO2 down to one-unit-cell on Si substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnium oxide (HfO2), particularly at low-dimensional scales, exhibits extensive promising applications in ultrahigh density devices like low-power logic and non-volatile memory devices due to its compatibility with current semiconductor technology1-5. However, achieving ferroelectricity (FE) at ultimate scale especially in undoped HfO2 remains challenging as the non-centrosymmetric FE phase, so-called O-III (space group: Pca21) is metastable and FE has a strong tendency of depolarization with the decrease in thickness6. Up to now, this phase has usually stabilized via doping with other elements7-9. But the minimum film thickness is still limited to 1 nm, about 2-unit-cell, to keep FE8. Thinner and undoped films, conducive to further miniature device size and avoid contamination during deposition process, have been a challenge to fabricate on Si substrates. Herein, we report the robust FE observed in undoped HfO2 ultrathin films directly grown on Si substrate via atomic layer deposition (ALD) and post-heat treat in vacuum. The so-fabricated ferroelectric O-III phase contains about 4.48 at% oxygen vacancy, is robust even monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c) coexists. The spontaneous and switchable polarization is remarkably stable, still surviving even in films down to 0.5 nm (one-unit-cell). Our results show the robust FE O-III phase can be obtained in films down to one-unit-cell in thickness on Si, providing a practical way to fabricating this important material in thickness limit.</description>

      <title>Inducing Spin Splitting and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in A-Type AFM Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$ through Electric Field and Janus Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are distinguished by zero net magnetic moment, high resistance to external magnetic disturbances, and ultrafast dynamic responses. For advancing AFM materials in spintronic and valleytronic applications, achieving spontaneous valley polarization and the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is pivotal. We predict an A-type AFM monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, which shows a significant spontaneous valley polarization of 157 meV. In Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, spatial inversion symmetry (P) and time-reversal symmetry (T) are individually broken, yet the combined PT symmetry is preserved. This symmetry conservation leads to spin degeneracy, resulting in zero Berry curvature in the momentum space and absence of AVHE. However, a layer-locked hidden Berry curvature is produced, leading to the observation of the valley layer-spin Hall effect. Further, an external out-of-plane electric field can induce spin splitting by introducing layer-dependent electrostatic potential, enabling the layer-locked AVHE. Additionally, the introduction of a built-in electric field caused by the Janus structure also induces spin splitting in monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)F due to the electric-potential-difference-AFM mechanism. The high out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and realization of AVHE, offer promising opportunities for next-generation spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Principles, Engineering and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters, molecular-sized complexes releasing a single photon at a time, have garnered much attention owing to their use as a key building block in various quantum technologies. Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B-N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined. Despite the current challenges, quantum emitters in hBN have steadily become a promising platform for applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Electron transport properties of heterogeneous interfaces in solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rechargeable batteries, electron transport properties of inorganics in the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) critically determine the safety, lifespan and capacity loss of batteries. However, the electron transport properties of heterogeneous interfaces among different solid inorganics in SEI have not been studied experimentally or theoretically yet, although such heterogeneous interfaces exist inevitably. Here, by employing non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method, we theoretically evaluated the atomic-scale electron transport properties under bias voltage for LiF/Li2O interfaces and single-component layers of them, since LiF and Li2O are common stable inorganics in the SEI. We reveal that heterogeneous interfaces orthogonal to the external electric-field direction greatly impede electron transport in SEI, whereas heterogeneous parallel-orientated interfaces enhance it. Structural disorders induced by densely distributed interfaces can severely interfere with electron transport. For each component, single-crystal LiF is highly effective to block electron transport, with a critical thickness of 2.9 nm, much smaller than that of Li2O (19.0 nm). This study sheds a new light into direct and quantitative understanding of the electron transport properties of heterogeneous interfaces in SEI, which holds promise for the advancement of a new generation of high-performance batteries.</description>

      <title>Hydrophilic direct bonding of (100) diamond and deposited SiO$_2$ substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond has emerged as a leading material for solid-state spin quantum systems and extreme environment electronics. However, a major limitation is that most diamond devices and structures are fabricated using bulk diamond plates. The absence of a suitable diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate hinders the advanced nanofabrication of diamond quantum and electronic devices, posing a significant roadblock to large-scale, on-chip diamond quantum photonics and electronics systems. In this work, we demonstrate the direct bonding of (100) single-crystal (SC) diamond plates to PECVD-grown SiO$_2$/Si substrates at low temperatures and atmospheric conditions. The surfaces of the SiO$_2$ and diamond plates are then activated using oxygen plasma and piranha solution, respectively. Bonding occurs when the substrates are brought into contact with water in between and annealed at 200$^{\circ}$C under atmospheric conditions, resulting in a DOI substrate. We systematically studied the influence of piranha solution treatment time and diamond surface roughness on the shear strength of the bonded substrate, devising an optimal bonding process that achieves a high yield rate of 90$\%$ and a maximum shear strength of 9.6 MPa. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for quantitative analysis of the surface chemicals at the bonding interface. It appears that the amount of -OH bindings increases with the initial roughness of the diamond, facilitating the strong bonding with the SiO$_2$. This direct bonding method will pave the way for scalable manufacturing of diamond nanophotonic devices and enable large-scale integration of diamond quantum and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Charging of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride - graphene heterostructures due to electrostatic screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant interest as single-photon emitters and spin qubits for applications in a wide range of quantum technologies. As the integration of these solid-state quantum emitters into electronic devices necessitates electrical control, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of charge control for these defect color centers in hBN/graphene heterostructures. In this Letter, we show that screening due to the encapsulation of hBN with graphene modifies the electrical levels of hBN, leading to charge transfer. Furthermore, we show that the charged defects have low-energy barriers for defect reorientation which can be overcome by moderate gate voltages. This study shows that accurate modeling of the charge state of the defect is necessary to be able to electrically control defects.</description>

      <title>Universal Catalyst Design Framework for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis Facilitated by Local Atomic Environment Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a universal and precise design framework is crucial to search high-performance catalysts, but it remains a giant challenge due to the diverse structures and sites across various types of catalysts. To address this challenge, herein, we developed a novel framework by the refined local atomic environment descriptors (i.e., weighted Atomic Center Symmetry Function, wACSF) combined with machine learning (ML), microkinetic modeling, and computational high-throughput screening. This framework is successfully integrated into the Digital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water oxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e., metal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a ML model. The proposed wACSF descriptors integrating both geometric and chemical features are proven effective in predicting the adsorption free energies with ML. Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models accurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\Delta}GOH*) and oxygen ({\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, a universal 2e- WOR microkinetic volcano model was derived with excellent agreement with experimental observations reported to date, which was further used to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts with the input of ML-predicted {\Delta}GOH*. Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface origin of the low-temperature magnetoresistance anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetoresistance (MR) anomaly at low temperatures has been observed in a variety of systems, ranging from low-dimensional chalcogenides to spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) metals and, most recently, topological semimetals. In some systems parabolic magnetoresistance can rise to hundreds of thousands of times its low-temperature, zero-field value. While the origin of such a dramatic effect remains unresolved, these systems are often low-carrier-density compensated metals, and the physics is expected to be quasi-classical. Here we demonstrate that this MR anomaly in temperature also exists in high conductivity good metals with large Fermi surfaces, namely Cr, Mo, and W, for both linear and quadratic field-dependent regimes with their non-saturation attributed to open orbit and electron-hole compensation, respectively. We provide evidence that quantum transport across sharp Fermi surface arcs, but not necessarily the full cyclotron orbit, governs this low-temperature MR anomaly. In Cr, extremely sharp curvatures are induced by superposed lattice and SDW band structures. One observes an overlay of the temperature dependence of three phenomena: namely, MR at a constant high field, linear MR in the low-field limit, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of the lightest orbit. In Mo, the temperature dependence of low-T MR anomaly extends beyond those of its SdH oscillations but disappears at temperatures where Kohler's scaling reemerges. In the low-temperature and high-field limit, large magnetoresistance from carriers circling quantum orbits is the three-dimensional analogy to the zero-conductance state of carrier localization in the integer quantum Hall effect, especially with regard to the adverse effect of disorder.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Properties of epitaxial $\text{Re}/\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}/\text{Pt}$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate epitaxial $\text{Co}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ and $\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ alloy thin-films surrounded by asymmetric heavy metals layers of $\text{Re}(10 \, \text{\r{A}})$ as a buffer and $\text{Pt}(30 \, \text{\r{A}})$ as a cap to study the magnetic anisotropy, interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) and damping. The increase of Au from 0% to 25% in the $\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}$ alloy generates the spin-reorientation transition of around 13% of Au. The increase in Au concentration provides a significant decrease in saturation magnetization from 1690 kA/m to 982 kA/m measured for Co and $\text{Co}_{75}\text{Au}_{25}$, respectively. The effective anisotropy constant $\text{K}_{eff}$ is elevated up to 0.33 $\text{MJ/m}^{3}$ by changing the Au content. Further, our investigations of the magnetization dynamics have confirmed that the overall effective damping constant rises with the Au concentration which can be attributed to the spin pumping effect. The spin pumping leads to the highest value of effective spin mixing conductance $g^{(\uparrow \downarrow)} \approx 2.91 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}$ in the $\text{Co}_{90}\text{Au}_{10}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ system, while the lowest value of $g^{(\uparrow \downarrow)} \approx 2.25 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}$ is found for the $\text{Co}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ system. Additionally, we have investigated the iDMI strength, and the amplitude of iDMI decreases with increasing Au concentration. The highest surface iDMI constant value equal to 2.62 pJ/m is observed for Co.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale robust graphene electronics under industrial processing conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For commercial grade electronic devices, stable structures are required to ensure a long device life span. When such devices contain nanomaterials like graphene, it is crucial that these materials resist industrial processes and harsh environments. For environments that contain water, graphene delamination is a notorious drawback, as water intercalation and eventually liftoff readily occur in aqueous and especially in alkaline solutions. This limitation renders graphene incompatible with key wafer-processing steps in the semiconductor industry. In this work, a covalent pyrene-based adhesion layer is synthesized in a facile, two-step procedure. Through {\pi}-{\pi} interactions, the adhesion of graphene to silicon wafers was maintained under conditions that resemble harsh processes, i.e. acidic and alkaline solutions, several organic solvents, and sonication. Moreover, they could be produced with a device measurement yield up to 99.7% and reproducible device-to-device electronic performance on 4-inch silicon wafers. Our results show that a straightforward functionalization of silicon wafers with an adhesive layer can be directly applicable in industrial-scale fabrication processes, giving access to robust graphene field effect devices that are built to last long.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Mott phase in excitonic double layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of excitonic Mott phases in the presence of a periodic potential and a non-local exciton-exciton interaction. The non-local interaction is treated in a mean-field approximation, while the local repulsion of the excitons is treated in a hopping expansion. The convergence of the latter is the criterion for the stability of the Mott phase with respect to quantum and thermal fluctuations. This hybrid approach enables us to establish a phase diagram for a bosonic Mott to superfluid transition. Our results could be useful to interpret recent experiments on electron-hole crystals in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Microtubes and nanomembranes by ion-beam-induced exfoliation of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports an innovative process to fabricate $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ microtubes and nanomembranes based on ion implantation in (100)-oriented single-crystals. We show that, under specific flux and fluence conditions, the irradiation-induced strain profile promotes the detachment and rolling-up of a thin surface layer, forming a microtube. The strain-disorder interplay was investigated in detail for Cr-implanted $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ with a range of complementary methods, showing an excellent agreement between experimental and simulation data, and suggesting an exfoliation mechanism that is correlated with the anisotropic nature of the $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ monoclinic system and its easy-cleavage planes. Moreover, these microtubes can be unrolled upon a subsequent annealing step, resulting in nanomembranes with bulk-like crystalline quality that can be transferred to other substrates. The recovery of the implantation-induced damage under thermal annealing has also been studied, showing a remarkable recovery at moderate temperatures (~500 {\deg}C). This observation underscores the potential of this method for the scalable production of nanomembranes with improved reproducibility compared to conventional mechanical exfoliation techniques. Importantly, such exfoliation can be done employing different ions, providing simultaneous $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ doping, chosen to control the structural, optical, magnetic and electrical properties of the nanomembranes, thus tailoring them to fit the desired applications.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Crossover and Emergence of Novel Phases in Puckered PdSe$_2$ under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pressure-driven structural and electronic evolution of PdSe\(_2\) using powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Beyond 2.3 GPa, suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion induces in-plane lattice expansion and metallization. Around 4.8 GPa, the interlayer \(d_{z^2}-\pi^*\) orbital hybridization drives the dimensional crossover, facilitating the transformation from the 2D distorted to a 3D undistorted pyrite phase. Above 9 GPa, a novel phase emerges, characterized by octahedral distortions in the $d$ orbitals of Pd. Structural analysis suggests the presence of marcasite (\(Pnnm\)) or arsenopyrite (\(P2_1/c\)) phase with orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations, respectively. Furthermore, the observed phonon anomaly and electronic structure modifications, including the emergence of flat bands in the high-pressure phases, elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the previously reported exotic superconductivity with an enhanced critical temperature. These results highlight the pivotal role of dimensional crossover and structural transitions in tuning the electronic properties of puckered materials, providing pathways for novel functionalities.</description>

      <title>Field-induced phase transitions in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study and possible application to $\alpha$-RuCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frustrated magnet $\alpha$-RuCl3 is one of the prime candidates for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). However, the existence of a field-induced intermediate QSL phase in this material remains under debate. Here, we employ sign-free numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model on the honeycomb lattice with $K=-2J$ under an applied magnetic field along the z-direction. Our findings reveal that the system undergoes a direct quantum phase transition from a zigzag magnetically ordered phase to a spin-polarized phase at zero temperature, which belongs to the 3D XY universality class. At finite temperatures, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition line separates the spin-polarized phase from a quasi-long-range ordered state, eventually terminating at the quantum critical point. Our results convincingly show that there is no intermediate QSL phase in the KH model with a z-direction magnetic field, which we believe will shed important light on understanding experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl3.</description>

      <title>Spin-Triplet Excitonic Insulator in the Ultra-Quantum Limit of HfTe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than fifty years ago, excitonic insulators, formed by the pairing of electrons and holes due to Coulomb interactions, were first predicted. Since then, excitonic insulators have been observed in various classes of materials, including quantum Hall bilayers, graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and more recently in moire superlattices. In these excitonic insulators, an electron and a hole with the same spin bind together and the resulting exciton is a spin singlet. Here, we report the experimental observation of a spin-triplet exciton insulator in the ultra-quantum limit of a three-dimensional topological material HfTe5. We observe that the spin-polarized zeroth Landau bands, dispersing along the field direction, cross each other beyond a characteristic magnetic field in HfTe5, forming the one-dimensional Weyl mode. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of a gap of about 250 {\mu}eV when the field surpasses a critical threshold. By performing the material-specific modeling, we identify this gap as a consequence of a spin-triplet exciton formation, where electrons and holes with opposite spin form bound states, and the translational symmetry is preserved. The system reaches charge neutrality following the gap opening, as evidenced by the zero Hall conductivity over a wide magnetic field range (10 - 72 T). Our finding of the spin-triplet excitonic insulator paves the way for studying novel spin transport including spin superfluidity, spin Josephson currents, and Coulomb drag of spin currents in analogy to the transport properties associated with the layer pseudospin in quantum Hall bilayers.</description>

      <title>Giant Third-Order Nonlinearity Induced by the Quantum Metric Quadrupole in Few-Layer WTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric properties of topological materials underpin many exotic physical phenomena and applications. Quantum nonlinearity has emerged as a powerful probe for revealing these properties. The Berry curvature dipole in nonmagnetic materials and the quantum metric dipole in antiferromagnets have been explored by studying the second-order nonlinear Hall effect. Although the quadrupole moment of the quantum geometric tensor is theoretically predicted to induce higher-order quantum nonlinearity, the quantum metric quadrupole remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the quantum metric quadrupole induced third-order nonlinear longitudinal electrical response in few-layer WTe2, persisting up to room temperature. Angle-resolved third-harmonic current-voltage characteristics are found consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetry of WTe2. Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we identify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed third-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle dependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order nonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.</description>

Abstract: We report the observation of current-modulated magnetoresistance hysteresis below the superconducting transition temperature in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This highly tunable hysteresis behavior is confined to the superconducting state and vanishes when superconductivity is fully suppressed, directly linking magnetoresistance hysteresis to the superconducting order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Additionally, the superconducting diode effect driven by a small magnetic field is observed, indicating the enhanced electronic magnetochiral anisotropy by the chiral domain-wall scattering. Our findings position CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring nontrivial physical phenomena, including unconventional pairing mechanisms and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Absence of superconductivity and density-wave transition in ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure stimulates intensive research interests. These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates. Our findings impose important constraints on the mechanism of pressure-induced superconductivity in nickelates and sheds new light on exploring ambient pressure high-temperature Ni-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Engineering nonlinear Hall effect in bilayer graphene/black phosphorus heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for generating emergent quantum phenomena through symmetry breaking. Stacking-induced symmetry breaking at interfaces provides an effective method to modulate their electronic properties for functional devices. Here, we strategically stack bilayer graphene with black phosphorus, a low-symmetry semiconductor, to break the symmetries and induce the nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) that can persist up to room temperature. Intriguingly, it is found the NLHE undergoes sign reversals by varying the electrical displacement field under fixed carrier density. The scaling analysis reveals that the sign reversal of the NLHE is contributed from both the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and extrinsic scatterings. The displacement field-induced sign reversal of the BCD indicates asymmetric distributions of Berry curvature hot spots across different Fermi pockets in bilayer graphene. Our findings suggest that symmetry engineering of van der Waals heterostructures is promising for room-temperature applications based on nonlinear quantum devices, such as high-frequency rectifiers and wireless charging.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Lattice Effect Originated Metal-Insulator Transition in FeSe$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.</description>

      <title>Correlation between magnetism and the Verwey transition in magnetite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seeking to unravel the enigmatic Verwey transition and its interplay with magnetism, we have conducted comprehensive measurements on the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and magnetic moment of stoichiometric and doped-magnetite single crystals at temperatures reaching 1000 K. These investigations have allowed us to identify the Curie temperature, $T_C$, and other characteristic temperatures of the electrical resistivity. Remarkably, we have identified correlations between these temperatures and the Verwey temperature, $T_V$, indicating that the electrical transport properties and the mechanism of the Verwey transition are closely related to the magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of cuprates and universal scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider the magnetic field phase diagram of hole-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates, which has been given much less attention than the temperature diagram. In the framework of the {\it pairon model}, we show that the two characteristic energies, the pair binding energy (the gap $\Delta_p$) and the condensation energy ($\beta_c$) resulting from pair correlations, give rise to two major magnetic fields, the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ and a second field, $B_{pg}$, associated with the pseudogap (PG). The latter implies a second length scale in addition to the coherence length, characteristic of incoherent pairs. Universal scaling laws for both $B_{c2}$ and $B_{pg}$ are derived: $B_{c2}$ scales with the critical temperature, $B_{c2}/T_c\simeq 1.65$ T/K, in agreement with many experiments, and $B_{pg}$ has a similar scaling with respect to $T^*$. Finally, Fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions are predicted to appear as a function of magnetic field, an effect testable experimentally.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Language-Structure Pre-training Driven by Materials Science Literature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.</description>

      <title>Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</description>

      <title>Hole Transfer Dynamics in Thin Films of Mixed-Dimensional Quasi-2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding of charge transfer processes in mixed-dimensional quasi-2D perovskites is crucial for their application in high-performance photovoltaic devices. In this work, we investigate the link between charge transport dynamics and morphology in a thin film of quasi-2D perovskites (PEA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1), grown with a distinct dimensionality gradient, where the n=1 phase is concentrated near the substrate and phases with higher dimensionality progressively increase in concentration toward the surface. By selectively exciting the n=4 phase, we observe efficient hole transfer to the n=2 and n=3 phases occurring within few tens of picoseconds after excitation. In contrast, the n=1 phase acts as a hole-blocking layer, limiting the overall charge transport efficiency. These results emphasize the critical importance of minimizing or eliminating the n=1 layer to enhance charge carrier separation and transport, offering valuable insights into the optimization of quasi-2D perovskite-based solar cells.</description>

Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a handful of other seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in optical media.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic anisotropy constant orders and thermal noise on skyrmion formation in the Co/Pt square nanostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions, which are topologically stable magnetic structures, have manifested promising features to be used as an information carrier in new-age, non-volatile data storage devices. In this article, Co/Pt square nano-structure with Co-free layer thickness in the range of 1 nm to 5 nm is taken to study the controlled creation of skyrmions. The magnetization dynamics controlled by the current-induced spin transfer torque help to nucleate skyrmions by transforming the perpendicularly magnetized ground state. This process leads to a stable state of isolated skyrmions via a complex transformation of the Neel wall following its image inversion. Skyrmion numbers vary with increasing thickness as the current density gradually increases. The impact of higher-order anisotropy constants (up to the second order) on the relaxed state of a system, compared to first-order anisotropy alone, has been examined. Additionally, the effect of temperature on the formation of skyrmions has been analyzed for all thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Low temperature state in strontium titanate microcrystals using in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.</description>

      <title>Kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis of the cation incorporation into GeO2, SnO2, and (SnxGe1-x)O2 during suboxide molecular beam epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rutile GeO$_2$ is a promising ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for future power electronic devices whose alloy with the wide bandgap semiconductor rutile-SnO$_2$ enables bandgap engineering and the formation of heterostructure devices. The (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ alloy system is in its infancy and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a well-suited technique for its thin-film growth, yet presents challenges in controlling the alloy composition and growth rate. To understand and mitigate this challenge, the present study comprehensively investigates the kinetics and thermodynamics of suboxide incorporation into GeO$_2$, SnO$_2$, and (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ during suboxide MBE, the latest development in oxide MBE using suboxide sources. We find suboxide MBE to simplify the growth kinetics, offering better control over growth rates than conventional MBE but without supporting cation-driven oxide layer etching. During binary growth, SnO incorporation is kinetically favored due to its higher oxidation efficiency and lower vapor pressure compared to those of GeO. In (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ growth, however, the GeO incorporation is preferred and the SnO incorporation is suppressed, indicating a catalytic effect, where SnO promotes GeO incorporation through cation exchange. The origin of this cation exchange is likely thermodynamic yet calls for further theoretical studies. Our experimental study provides guidance for controlling the growth rate and alloy composition of (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ in suboxide MBE, highlighting the impact of the substrate temperature and active oxygen flux besides that of the mere SnO:GeO flux stoichiometry. The results are likely transferable to further physical and chemical vapor deposition methods, such as conventional and hybrid MBE, pulsed laser deposition, mist- or metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can emerge solely from the influence of transport processes that depend on energy levels, voltage polarity, and asymmetries in charge transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our approach provides a fully analytical framework that directly correlates microscopic charge dynamics with macroscopic dielectric responses, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive capability for systems dominated by displacement currents.</description>

Abstract: ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A = Cs or Rb) are emerging topological kagome metals that exhibit superconductivity and nematicity without intertwining translational symmetry-breaking charge orders. In this work, we explore the fermiology of their titanium kagome electrons and identify a set of sublattice-pure, high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that can suppress charge ordering and enhance electronic correlations and superconductivity. Our calculations of charge susceptibility for kagome bands with both normal and high-order VHSs emphasize the role of these VHSs in driving electronic nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Additionally, we compute the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interactions for CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pristine, doped, and kagome-exposed surface conditions, revealing its robustness against structural instabilities while enhancing the superconducting transition temperature. Our work positions ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ as a key platform for investigating superconductivity and electronic nematicity without translational symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale metastable structure formation in nickel-aluminum alloys synthesized far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reports a new meta-stable structure in epitaxial nickel-aluminum (Ni-Al) films (Al content up to 24.4 at.%) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Structure probes by XRD, HRTEM and nano-indentation combined with atomistic simulations consistently demonstrate that in thin film samples with coexisting {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases, domains of the two phases are homogeneously intermixed at the atomic-scale, forming a coherent matched lattice with one overall lattice parameter. It expands as aluminum (Al) concentration increases, with {\gamma} phase domains being progressively replaced by {\gamma}' phase domains. This behavior is similar to a solid solution, where the atomic-scale domain of the {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases act as solute and solvent, respectively. Isothermal annealing and nanoindentation reveal that the structure decomposes into distinct {\gamma}' and {\gamma} phases due to the loss of lattice matching at 400 {\deg}C, resulting in an increase in hardness. This is followed by further relaxation and domain growth at higher temperatures (600 {\deg}C and 800 {\deg}C), accompanied by a decrease in hardness. These observations confirm the metastable nature of the nanoscale {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases system, enhance the understanding of the Ni-Al alloy system and providing new insights for meta-stable intermetallic thin film synthesis.</description>

      <title>Effect of interface on magnetic exchange coupling in Co/Ru/Co trilayer: from ab-initio simulations to micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interfaces play a substantial role for the functional properties of structured magnetic materials and magnetic multilayers. Modeling the functional behavior of magnetic materials requires the treatment of the relevant phenomena at the device level. Properties predicted from the electronic structure and spin dynamics at the atomistic level have to be properly transferred into a continuum level treatment. In this work we show how Co/Ru/Co three layers can be simulated with the continuum theory of micromagnetism, with interface coupling energies and bulk intrinsic properties properly derived from the results of \emph{ab initio} and spin dynamics simulations at different temperatures.</description>

      <title>Double-tough ceramics: Optimization-supported multiscale computational design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To overcome the brittleness limitation of ceramics, various toughening mechanisms have been proposed. Some of the most remarkable, especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspired brick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has, however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into a single all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computational methodology for the design of a material that combines these two toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that captures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture performance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline mortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase transformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations, and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformation stress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortar constitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremely effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of brick size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials is then systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimization algorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and material parameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortar thickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations of material properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortar thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Molecule Graph Networks with Many-body Equivariant Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Long wavelength interdomain phonons and instability of dislocations in small-angle twisted bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. We argue that pinning potential and/or small deformations of the dislocations could stabilize the gapless phonon spectra. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.</description>

      <title>Self-organization and memory in an disordered solid subject to random loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider self-organization and memory formation in a mesoscopic model of an amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We develop proper read-out protocols to show that the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range, which can be subsequently retrieved. Our findings generalize previous results obtained upon oscillatory driving and suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a disordered system interacting with its fluctuating environment. The self-organization results in a correlation between the dynamics of the system and its environment. We conclude by discussing our results within the context of environmental sensing, highlighting their generalizability to adaptation strategies of simple organisms under changing conditions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. Specifically, there are a total of 26 Rashba semiconductors with isolated spin splitting bands contributed by Se/Te-pz orbitals at conduction band minimum, and their Rashba constant is closely related to the intrinsic electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. As the atomic number increases, the bandgap of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) continually decreases until it shrinks to a point where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs and it reopens with a nontrivial topology. In conjunction with band inversion, pz orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double Rashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be further effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a continuous evolution of topological to non-topological accompanied by different spin textures. This work provides new insights into Rashba and topology physics and further presents indispensable inversion asymmetry materials for the development of nonlinear optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Charge-density-wave quantum critical point under pressure in 2$H$-TaSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</description>
