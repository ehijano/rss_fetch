      <title>Isotope shift for total electron binding energy of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the isotope shifts of the \emph{total} electron binding energy of neutral atoms and singly charged ions up to element $Z=120$, using relativistic Hartree-Fock method including the Breit interaction. Field shift coefficients are extracted by varying the nuclear charge radius; a small quadratic term is retained to cover large radius changes relevant to superheavy nuclei. We tabulate isotope shift coefficients for closed shell systems from Ne to Og and benchmark selected open shell cases, used to test the interpolation formula. A simple power law interpolation $bZ^k$ reproduces calculated field shifts to within about 1\% across the table, with the effective exponent $k$ growing from roughly 5 near $Z \sim 50$ to about 12 at $Z \sim 118$. Due to the domination of inner shells, differences between neutrals and singly charged ions does not exceed few percent, becoming noticeable mainly when an outer $s$ electron is removed. Therefore, these results may also be used for higher charge ions.</description>

      <title>Efficient single-atom transfer from an optical conveyor belt to a tightly confined optical tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient loading of single atoms into tightly confined traps is crucial for advancing quantum information processing and exploring atom-photon interactions. However, directly loading atoms from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) into static tweezers in cavity-based systems and hybrid atom-photon interfaces remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate atom loading in a tightly confined optical tweezer 0.6mm away from MOT by an optical conveyor belt. By employing real-time feedback control of the atom number in the overlapping region between the conveyor belt and the tweezer, we enhance a single-atom loading probability to 77.6%. Our technique offers a versatile solution for deterministic single-atom loading in various experimental settings and paves the way for diverse applications based on hybrid photonic-atom structures.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavored hydrogen molecule systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of $S$-wave exotic hydrogen-like three-body systems ($pp\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-$, $\mu^-\mu^-p$, $\tau^-\tau^-p$, $p\mu^-\tau^-$) with spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$, and four-body systems ($pp\mu^-\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-\tau^-$) with $J^P = 0^+$, $1^+$, and $2^+$. We use complex scaling and Gaussian expansion methods to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"{o}dinger equation and obtain possible bound and quasi-bound states. The resulting binding energies range from $-33.8$~keV to $-340$~eV. Notably, we present the first theoretical estimation of the bound-state energy levels of $pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$, which is of significant importance for understanding exotic few-body Coulomb systems. We further analyze spin configurations and root-mean-square radii to elucidate the spatial structure of these bound and quasi-bound states. Our results reveal that $K$-type spatial configurations play a crucial role in accurately describing bound and quasi-bound states in the hydrogen-molecule-like systems $pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$. Incorporating $K$-type configurations significantly alters the mass spectra of these states. Future muon colliders and muon facilities may offer promising platforms for the possible copious production of such heavy flavored hydrogen molecules and molecular ions. For instance, scattering processes such as $2\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2} \to \mathrm{H_{2\mu}} + 2e^-$, $\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2} \to \mathrm{H_{\mu e}} + e^-$, and $\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2^+} \to \mathrm{H_{2\mu}^+} + e^-$ could be utilized, facilitating detailed studies of intriguing states such as $\mathrm{H_{2\mu}}$, $\mathrm{H_{\mu e}}$, and $\mathrm{H_{2\mu}^+}$.</description>

      <title>QED calculations of the $2p$-$2s$ transition energies in Li-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic QED calculations of ionization energies of the $2s$, $2p_{1/2}$, and $2p_{3/2}$ states, as well as the $2p_{1/2}$--$2s$ and $2p_{3/2}$--$2p_{1/2}$ transition energies are performed for Li-like ions with the nuclear charge numbers $Z = 10$--$100$. The convergence of QED perturbative expansion is improved by using the extended Furry picture, which starts from the Dirac equation with a local screening potential. An ab initio treatment is accomplished for one- and two-photon electron-structure QED effects and the one-photon screening of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections. This is complemented with an approximate treatment of the two-photon QED screening and higher-order (three or more photon) electron-structure effects. As a result, the obtained theoretical predictions improve upon the accuracy achieved in previous calculations. Comparison with available experimental data shows a good agreement between theory and experiment. In most cases, the theoretical values surpass the experimental results in precision, with only a few exceptions. In the case of uranium and bismuth, the comparison provides one of the most stringent tests of bound-state QED in the strong-field regime. Alternatively, the obtained results can be employed for high-precision determinations of nuclear charge radii.</description>

      <title>Study of thorium in hypersonic gas jets: Ionization potentials of Th and Th$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser ionization spectroscopy was performed on both neutral and singly ionized $^{232}$Th with the aim of identifying the nuclear-clock isomer in the singly charged ionic state of $^{229}$Th. A search for an efficient laser ionization scheme of $^{232}$Th$^+$ was conducted in an argon-filled gas cell. This revealed a congested spectrum due to collisional quenching effects and the presence of several auto-ionizing states, one of which has a laser ionization efficiency of at least $1.2 \%$. Using a threshold approach, the second ionization potential was determined to be $12.300(9)\,$eV. The subsequent study on atomic $^{232}$Th validated the threshold approach. Conducting spectroscopy in a hypersonic gas jet, suppressed the gas-collision-induced quenching, revealing a Rydberg series that converges to the first ionization potential, determined to be $6.306879(14)\,$eV. The gas jet also cools down the thorium, allowing for high-resolution laser spectroscopy with a resolution of $240(30)\,$MHz. Using the Multiconfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method, the ionization potentials were computed, showing a relative difference of 0.06\% and 0.19\% between theory and our experimental values for the ionization potentials of Th and Th$^+$ respectively. Further calculations using a pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method reveal strong mixing in the used intermediate state at $26113.27\,$cm$^{-1}$ of Th. A dedicated fast-extraction gas cell with $^{233}$U recoil sources was used to study $^{229}$Th$^+$ but no photo-ionization signal could be observed.</description>

      <title>A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer network, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30MHz serves as both an intrinsic inductor and a power-sharing element. The design enables high current delivery and flexible impedance matching across a wide frequency range. We integrate both broadband and narrowband RF networks into a unified configuration that overcomes the geometric constraints imposed by the metallic chamber. In evaporative cooling, the broadband network allows a reduction of the applied RF input power from 14.7dBW to -3.5dBW, owing to its non-zero coil current even at ultra-low frequencies. This feature enables the Bose-Fermi mixture to be cooled below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the coil driven by the narrowband network transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F = 2,mF = 2&gt; to |2,-2&gt; in 1 millisecond, achieving a Rabi frequency of approximately 9 kHz at an input power of 0.1dBW.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times, low-loss, and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of 23 minutes, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing and quantum error correction with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect.</description>

      <title>Energy Time Ptychography for one-dimensional phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is at the heart of adaptive optics and modern high-resolution imaging. Without phase information, optical systems are limited to intensity-only measurements, hindering full reconstruction of object structures and wavefront dynamics essential for advanced applications. Here, we address a one-dimensional phase problem linking energy and time, which arises in X-ray scattering from ultrasharp nuclear resonances. We leverage the M\"ossbauer effect, where nuclei scatter radiation without energy loss to the lattice, and are sensitive to their magneto-chemical environments. Rather than using traditional spectroscopy with radioactive gamma-ray sources, we measure nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron X-ray pulses in the time domain, providing superior sensitivity and faster data acquisition. Extracting spectral information from a single measurement is challenging due to the missing phase information, typically requiring extensive modeling. Instead, we use multiple energetically overlapping measurements to retrieve both the transmission spectrum and the phase of the scattering response, similar to ptychographic phase retrieval in imaging. Our robust approach can overcome the bandwidth limitations of gamma-ray sources, opening new research directions with modern X-ray sources and M\"ossbauer isotopes.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice, we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry -- the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, computed using a phase-space parameter, is directly related to the phase-space winding number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties -- topologically protected fermionic states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</description>
