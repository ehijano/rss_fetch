      <title>Response of fluorescent molecular rotors in ternary macromolecular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a few decades, Fluorescent Molecular Rotors have been commonly employed as local probes of microviscosity in complex materials. However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition. Analysis show that while this theory semi-quantitatively captures the observation, its precise use raises some questions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Representation-Based Sampling for the Efficient Generation of Datasets for Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Enhanced Representation-Based Sampling (ERBS), a novel enhanced sampling method designed to generate structurally diverse training datasets for machine-learned interatomic potentials. ERBS automatically identifies collective variables by dimensionality reduction of atomic descriptors and applies a bias potential inspired by the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling framework. We highlight the ability of Gaussian moment descriptors to capture collective molecular motions and explore the impact of biasing parameters using alanine dipeptide as a benchmark system. We show that free energy surfaces can be reconstructed with high fidelity using only short biased trajectories as training data. Further, we apply the method to the iterative construction of a liquid water dataset and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients for models trained with molecular dynamics and ERBS data. Further, we active-learn models for liquid water with and without enhanced sampling and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients. The self-diffusion coefficients closely match those simulated with a reference model at a significantly reduced dataset size. Finally, we compare the sampling behaviour of enhanced sampling methods by benchmarking the mean squared displacements of \ce{BMIM+BF4-} trajectories simulated with uncertainty-driven dynamics and ERBS and find that the latter significantly increases the exploration of configurational space.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of unconstrained machine-learned interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are increasingly used to replace computationally demanding electronic-structure calculations to model matter at the atomic scale. The most commonly used model architectures are constrained to fulfill a number of physical laws exactly, from geometric symmetries to energy conservation. Evidence is mounting that relaxing some of these constraints can be beneficial to the efficiency and (somewhat surprisingly) accuracy of MLIPs, even though care should be taken to avoid qualitative failures associated with the breaking of physical symmetries. Given the recent trend of \emph{scaling up} models to larger numbers of parameters and training samples, a very important question is how unconstrained MLIPs behave in this limit. Here we investigate this issue, showing that -- when trained on large datasets -- unconstrained models can be superior in accuracy and speed when compared to physically constrained models. We assess these models both in terms of benchmark accuracy and in terms of usability in practical scenarios, focusing on static simulation workflows such as geometry optimization and lattice dynamics. We conclude that accurate unconstrained models can be applied with confidence, especially since simple inference-time modifications can be used to recover observables that are consistent with the relevant physical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Electron Transfer, Diabatic Couplings and Vibronic Energy Gaps in a Phase Space Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well-known Shin-Metiu model for an electronic crossing, using both a standard Born-Huang (BH) framework and a novel phase space (PS) electronic Hamiltonian framework. We show that as long as we are not in the strongly nonadiabatic region, a phase space framework can obtain a relative error in vibrational energy gap which is consistently one order of magnitude smaller than what is found within a BH framework. In line with recent results showing that dynamics on one phase space surface can outperform dynamics on one Born-Oppenheimer surface, our results indicate that the same advantages should largely hold for curve crossings and dynamics on two or a handful of electronic surfaces, from which several implications can be surmised as far as the possibility of spin-dependent electron transfer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatiotemporal patterns in a fuel-driven coupled cooperative supramolecular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemically fueled supramolecular systems can exhibit complex, time-dependent behaviors reminiscent of living matter when maintained far from equilibrium by continuous energy or fuel consumption. Here, we introduce a minimal reaction-diffusion model that captures the essential dynamics of a cooperative supramolecular polymerization network driven by monomer activation and deactivation. We show that a balance between autocatalytic growth and inhibitory decay sustains a nonequilibrium steady state in the model that undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, giving rise to autonomous oscillations. When spatial transport is introduced through diffusion, the system displays rich spatiotemporal phenomena, such as traveling wavefronts and transient polygonal patterns. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between reaction kinetics and diffusion can spontaneously generate self-organized, life-like dynamics in synthetic supramolecular polymer systems. This theoretical framework not only bridges molecular self-assembly and active matter dynamics but also provides design principles for creating adaptive, oscillatory, and self-patterning materials powered by chemical fuels.</description>

      <title>Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that uMLIPs encode the chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</description>

      <title>Full symmetry-breaking of electronic and nuclear dynamics for low attosecond resolution of electronic chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond science is an emerging topic where chirality plays a central role. Here we demonstrate subjecting iodoacetylene, a geometrically achiral molecule, to a pair of simulated non-ionizing ultrafast circularly polarized laser pulses at the highest time resolution to date, by two orders of magnitude (3.87 attoseconds), of the continuously-valued S and R electronic chirality assignments. We partner the only vector-based quantum chemical physics theory enabling full symmetry-breaking with electronic and nuclear dynamics simulations: the former does not require charge density differences or special symmetry positions. The resulting 'easy' and 'hard' directions of the total electronic charge density motion are quantified as a cardioid-like morphology for the duration of the simulated laser pulses and toroidal afterwards. Future research directions include determination of the underlying mechanism governing chiral induced spin selectivity, in addition to application to chiral spin selective phenomena in opto-spintronics and exotic superconductors, partnered with orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT).</description>

      <title>Enhanced Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method with Hessian Eigenmode Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the CI-NEB with the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench benchmark set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction in energy and force calculations of 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. These results establish this hybrid method as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the exact equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy can be obtained from the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CC and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a time-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 101 pg to 353 pg, one order of magnitude lower than values reported for pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of nanoplastics. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates in the form of fragments and smaller oligomers could be identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration, even in the presence of an organic matrix. Accelerated aging of the nylon teabags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced by fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue is in some cases a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing. Transitions similar to the noise-driven case can only occur if the amplitude of the chaotic forcing is large enough. If this is the case, in our numerical example - a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - we observe the chaotic Kramers' law to hold even when the chaotic forcing is far from the stochastic limit. We discuss the limitations of the chaotic Kramers' law, how to address the numerical issues associated with the timescale separation, and give a possible explanation for the dynamics of recently found AMOC collapses and recoveries in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>Can a Quantum Computer Simulate Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra Better than a Classical One?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of the spectra measured in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments is a computationally non-trivial problem which, due to its natural interpretation as a quantum spin problem, maps in a straightforward way to a quantum computer. As such, it represents a problem for which such a device may provide some practical advantage over traditional computing methods. In order to understand the extent to which such problems may indeed provide examples of useful quantum advantage, it is important to understand the limitations of existing classical simulation methods. In this work, we benchmark our own classical solver designed to study such problems. This solver uses a clustering approximation to achieve a resource scaling which is linear in the total number of nuclear spins in a given molecule, for a fixed cluster size. The success of such an approximation would present a stark repudiation to the common claim that such problems require an exponential scaling of resources, the very claim which makes simulating an NMR spectra a candidate for quantum advantage. Our benchmarking results indicate that our approximation performs well throughout, and even somewhat beyond, the more typical experimental regimes. We discuss what implications this may have for future efforts to demonstrate quantum advantage in the context of NMR.</description>

      <title>Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic corrections to electric quadrupole transition rates in H$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive formulas and perform calculations of nonadiabatic corrections to rates of electric quadrupole transitions in the hydrogen molecule. These corrections can be represented in terms of the quadrupole moment curve $D^{(1)}(R)$, similarly to the Born-Oppenheimer one, $D^{(0)}(R)$, derived originally by Wolniewicz. Numerical results change E2 transition rates for the fundamental band by as much as 0.4 - 12\% depending on rotational quantum numbers.</description>
