      <title>Probing Antiferromagnetic Hysteresis on Programmable Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using programmable analog quantum annealing processors, we implement a sampling-based magnetic hysteresis protocol to probe the counterintuitive notion of magnetic memory of antiferromagnets. A key component of this protocol responsible for the hysteresis is a transverse field, which enables state transitions, while the magnetic field sweep is done via a longitudinal control field. We present evidence of full saturation and reversal of the hysteresis curve, as well as emergent magnetic domain mediated by quantum fluctuations that give rise to the magnetic memory effect in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phonon bottleneck effect on the thermal depopulation from a photoexcited shallow defect in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a phonon bottleneck effect impacting the thermal depopulation of photoexcited shallow defects in high-resistivity silicon. Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon. These findings provide microscopic insight into carrier relaxation dynamics in silicon and highlight the significance of electron-phonon interactions in the ultrafast processes governing materials used in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Approximate resolution convolution function for fitting a dispersion gap measured on a triple-axis spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic convoluted-gap function, eq. 11 in the manuscript, for fitting dispersion gaps measured on triple-axis spectrometers (TAS). At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Aharonov-Bohm Motifs via Engineered Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between external gauge fields and lattice geometry can induce extreme localization dynamics through complete destructive interference. We show that combining this flux-induced localization with engineered dissipation leads to robust spin synchronization in rotationally symmetric spin geometries, referred to as Aharonov-Bohm motifs, with cyclic symmetries of any order. The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif. We further demonstrate that multiple motifs can fully synchronize when coupled, which is achieved by applying additional collective dissipation acting on all intra-motif spins. These results reveal a direct connection between flux-induced localization, dissipative engineering, and collective quantum synchronization.</description>

      <title>Scattering in Time-Varying Drude-Lorentz Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, the theoretical study of wave propagation in time varying materials is of current interest. Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>A set of nearly good real numbers to specify the ground states associated with a Hamiltonian containing non-commutable terms and the effect of the odd-channel of a pair of different bosons emerging in multi-species systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distinguishing feature of multi-species boson systems is the appearance of the odd channel, in which the spins of two different bosons are coupled to an odd integer. Through exact numerical solutions of the Schrodinger equation for a medium-body cold system containing two kinds of spin-1 atoms, the effect of the odd channel on the ground state (GS) has been studied. It was found that the odd-channel causes two types of fluctuation (a mixing of various components). (i) coherent mixing, where all the components have the same sign. In this way, the probability of an odd-pair emerging in the spin-state would be smaller; thus, this way would be adopted by the GS when the odd channel is repulsive. (ii) cyclic mixing, where half selected components have the + sign while the other half have the - sign. In this way, the probability of an odd-pair is larger; thus, this way would be adopted by the GS when the odd channel is attractive. It was further found that the terms in the Hamiltonian are no longer all commutable. Accordingly, the spin of a single species S_X (X=A, B) is no longer conserved. However, its average \overline{S_X} is well defined. It turns out that S_X and \overline{S_X} vary with the strengths in a similar way. The former jumps step-by-step from a good quantum number (an even integer) to the next good quantum number, the latter jumps also in a step-by-step way, but from a "real number" to another well-separated "real number". Exactly speaking, each of these real numbers is not exactly a number but an interval with a very narrow width at the real axis. Thus, the GS can be specified by these real numbers. It was found that, when the strengths of the two intraspecies interactions are not remarkably different, and/or the particle numbers are larger, the widths of the intervals are narrower, the above picture holds more nicely, and the GS can be well-specified by these real numbers.</description>

      <title>Spin-Axis Dynamic Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The all-electrical realization of highly spin-polarized charge currents and their efficient conversion into pure spin currents remains a fundamental challenge in spintronics. Here, we report a spin-axis dynamic locking (SADL) effect in altermagnets that pins the spin polarization to the crystalline axes: an in-plane electric field along one principal axis drives a fully spin-up charge current, whereas along the orthogonal axis, it generates an equal spin-down current. Consequently, applying an electric field diagonally yields a transverse pure spin current with 100% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. Mechanistically, SADL originates in a distinctive tent state characterized by alternating spin-split flat bands and orthogonal Fermi-surface lines. High-throughput first-principles screening confirms SADL in broad materials (e.g., 2D Cr2WSe4 monolayer and a synthesized three-dimensional compound, (BaF)2Mn2Se2O). Our work thus opens a route to ultra-low-power, reconfigurable spintronic devices where the spin states are governed solely by electric field orientation.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws for Deep Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws--power-law relationships between generalization errors and characteristics of deep learning models--are vital tools for developing reliable models while managing limited resources. Although the success of large language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing data size.</description>
