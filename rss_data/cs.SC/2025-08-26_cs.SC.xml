      <title>modelSolver: A Symbolic Model-Driven Solver for Power Network Simulation and Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of advanced software tools for power system analysis requires extensive programming expertise. Even when using open-source tools, programming skills are essential to modify built-in models. This can be particularly challenging for domain experts who lack coding proficiency. This paper introduces modelSolver, a software solution with a new framework centered around symbolic mathematical modeling. The proposed paradigm facilitates defining models through intuitive mathematical expressions, thus eliminating the need for traditional programming constructs such as arrays, loops, and sparse matrix computations. The modelSolver focuses on power flow and state estimation using an open-box approach, which allows users to specify custom models using either real or complex variables. Unlike existing tools that rely on hard-coded models, modelSolver enables the representation of a wide range of advanced functionalities, including power flow with voltage regulators and load tap changers, continuation power flow, and Gauss-Newton state estimation with equality constraints. Compatibility with MATPOWER is ensured via a converter that automates importing data files. The framework prioritizes model-driven development and empowers domain experts to focus on power system modeling without programming barriers. It aims to simplify power system computations, making them more accessible to students, scientists, and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Views: A Hardware-friendly Graph Database Model For Storing Semantic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph database (GDB) is an increasingly common storage model for data involving relationships between entries. Beyond its widespread usage in database industries, the advantages of GDBs indicate a strong potential in constructing symbolic artificial intelligences (AIs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where knowledge of data inter-relationships takes a critical role in implementation. However, current GDB models are not optimised for hardware acceleration, leading to bottlenecks in storage capacity and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly GDB model, called Views. We show its data structure and organisation tailored for efficient storage and retrieval of graph data and demonstrate its equivalence to represent traditional graph representations. We further demonstrate its symbolic processing abilities in semantic reasoning and cognitive modelling with practical examples and provide a short perspective on future developments.</description>
