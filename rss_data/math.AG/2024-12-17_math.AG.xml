      <title>On the classification of smooth toric surfaces with exactly one exceptional curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all smooth projective toric surfaces $S$ containing exactly one exceptional curve. We show that every such surface $S$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{F}_1$ or a surface $S_r$ defined by a rational number $r \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \mathbb{Z}$ $(r &gt;1)$. If $a:= [ r]$ then $S_r$ is obtained from the minimal desingularization of the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1, 2, 2a+1)$ by toric blow-ups whose quantity equals the level of the rational number $\{ r \} \in (0,1)$ in the classical Farey tree. Moreover, we show that if $r = b/c$ with coprime $b$ and $c$, then $S_r$ is the minimal desingularization of the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1, c, b)$. We apply $2$-dimensional regular fans $\Sigma_r$ of toric surfaces $S_r$ for constructing $2$-dimensional colored fans $\Sigma^c$ of minimal horospherical $3$-folds having a regular $SL(2) \times \mathbb{G}_m$-action. The latter are minimal toric $3$-folds $V_r$ classified by Z. Guan. We establish a direct combinatorial connection between the $3$-dimensional fans $\widetilde{\Sigma}^c_r$ of $3$-folds $V_r$ and the $2$-dimensional fans $\Sigma_r$ of surfaces $S_r$.</description>

      <title>On the K-stability of blow-ups of projective bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the K-stability of certain blow-ups of $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles over a Fano variety $V$, where the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle is the projective compactification of a line bundle $L$ proportional to $-K_V$ and the center of the blow-up is the image along a positive section of a divisor $B$ also proportional to $L$. When $V$ and $B$ are smooth, we show that, for $B \sim_{\mathbb{Q}} 2L$, the K-semistability and K-polystability of the blow-up is equivalent to the K-semistability and K-polystability of the log Fano pair $(V,aB)$ for some coefficient $a$ explicitly computed. We also show that, for $B \sim_{\mathbb{Q}} l L$, $l \neq 2$, the blow-up is K-unstable.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with a higher-order nonsymplectic automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe Baily-Borel, toroidal, and geometric -- using the KSBA stable pairs -- compactifications of some moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with a nonsymplectic automorphism of order $3$ and $4$ for which the fixed locus of the automorphism contains a curve of genus $\ge2$. For order $3$, we treat all the maximal-dimensional such families. We show that the toroidal and the KSBA compactifications in these cases admit simple descriptions in terms of certain $ADE$ root lattices.</description>

      <title>Normal surface singularities of small degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of the Yau sequence was introduced by Tomaru, as an attempt to extend Yau's elliptic sequence for (weakly) elliptic singularities to normal surface singularities of higher fundamental genera. In this paper, we obtain the canonical cycle using the Yau cycle for certain surface singularities of degree two. Furthermore, we obtain a formula of arithmetic genera and an upper bound of geometric genera for these singularities. We also give some properties about the classification of weighted dual graphs of certain surface singularities of degree two.</description>

      <title>Dynamic constructions of hyperbolisms of plane curves: an automated exploration of geometric loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolism of a given curve with respect to a point and a line is an interesting construct, a special kind of geometric locus, not frequent in the literature. While networking between two different kinds of mathematical software, we explore various cases, involving quartics, among them the so-called Kuelp quartic and topologically equivalent curves, and also an example with a sextic and a curve of degree 12. By a similar but different way, we derive a new construction of a lemniscate of Gerono. First, parametric equations are derived for the curve, then we perform implicitization Groebner bases packages and using elimination. The polynomial equation which is obtained enables to check irreducibility of the constructed curve.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We prove that the arithmetic $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of smooth partially proper spaces over $K$ satisfies a duality, as conjectured by Colmez, Gilles and Nizio{\l}. We derive it from the geometric duality on the Fargues-Fontaine curve by Galois techniques of Fontaine.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic Local Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss symmetrical monoidal $\infty$-categoricalizations in relavant $p$-adic functional analysis and $p$-adic analytic geometry. Our motivation has three sources relevant in $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence: one is the corresponding foundation from Bambozzi-Ben-Bassat-Kremnizer on derived functional analysis and Clausen-Scholze on derived topologicalization, and the second one is representations of derived $E_1$-rings which is relevant in integral deformed version of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence with eventually Banach coefficients, and the third one is the corresponding comparison of the solid quasicoherent sheaves over two kinds of generalized prismatization stackifications over small arc stacks and small $v$-stacks: one from the de Rham Robba stackification, and the other one from the de Rham prismatization stackification. Small arc stacks imperfectize the prismatization stackification, which will then perfectize the prismatization stackification when we regard them as small $v$-stacks. After Scholze's philosophy, one can in fact imperfectize those significant $v$-stacks in Fargues-Scholze to still have the geometrization at least by using Berkovich motives. Both small arc-stacks and small $v$-stacks can be studied using local totally disconnectedness which is the key observation for condensed mathematics, theory of diamonds and perfectoid rings.</description>

      <title>The many faces of a logarithmic scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard assumption in the study of logarithmic structures is "fineness", but this assumption is not preserved by intersections, fiber products, and more general limits. We explain how a coherent logarithmic scheme $X$ has a natural decomposition into "fine faces" -- a collection of fine logarithmic subschemes. This allows for importation of the techniques of tropical geometry into the study of more general logarithmic schemes. We explain the relevance of the construction in enumerative geometry and moduli via a range of examples. Techniques developed in the study of binomial schemes lead to effective algorithms for computing the fine faces.</description>

      <title>Geometric Height on Flag Varieties in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p\neq 0$. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $k$, $P \subseteq G$ be a parabolic subgroup and $\lambda: P \longrightarrow G$ be a strictly anti-dominant character. Let $C$ be a projective smooth curve over $k$ with function field $K=k(C)$ and $F$ be a principal $G$-bundle on $C$. Then $F/P \longrightarrow C$ is a flag bundle and $\mathcal{L}_\lambda=F \times_P k_\lambda$ on $F/P$ is a relatively ample line bundle. We compute the height filtration and successive minima of the height function $h_{\mathcal{L}_\lambda}: X(\overline{K}) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ over the flag variety $X=(F/P)_K$.</description>

      <title>On holographic duals of certain isolated weighted Gorenstein cDV singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on an important mathematical conjecture, together with hypothesis of homological mirror symmetry in the context of Landau-Ginzburg models, we show that a class of compound Du Val singularities do not admit a crepant resolution. Most of these singularities sit in the type cEn. This implies that those singularities are not dual to four dimensional N =1 superconformal quiver gauge theories through stacks of D3 branes placed at the singularities. We verify this statement on the physics side by enumerating consistent gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The Fine interior of dilations of a rational polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nondegenerate toric hypersurface of negative Kodaira dimension can be characterized by the empty Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work by Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior is the rational subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least 1 to all integral supporting hyperplanes of the Newton polytope. Moreover, we get more information in this situation if we can describe how the Fine interior behaves for dilations of the Newton polytope, e.g. if we can determine the smallest dilation with a non-empty Fine interior. Therefore, in this article we give a purely combinatorial description of the Fine interiors of all dilations of a rational polytope, which allows us in particular to compute this smallest dilation and to classify all lattice 3-polytopes with empty Fine interior, for which we have only one point as Fine interior of the smallest dilation with non-empty Fine interior.</description>

      <title>Symbolic powers of the generic linkage of maximal minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I$ be the ideal generated by the maximal minors of a matrix $X$ of indeterminates over a field and let $J$ denote the generic link, i.e., the most general link, of $I$. The generators of the ideal $J$ are not known. We provide an explicit description of the lead terms of the generators of $J$ using Gr\"obner degeneration: For a carefully chosen term order, the reduced Gr\"obner basis of the generic link $J$ is a minimal set of its generators and the initial ideal of $J$ is squarefree. We leverage this description of the initial ideal to establish the equality of the symbolic and ordinary powers of $J$. Our analysis of the initial ideal readily yields the Gorenstein property of the associated graded ring of $J$, and, in positive characteristic, the $F$-rationality of the Rees algebra of $J$. Using the technique of $F$-split filtrations, we further obtain the $F$-regularity of the blowup algebras of $J$.</description>

      <title>Functorial transfer for reductive groups and central complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of Weyl group equivariant $\ell$-adic complexes on a torus, called the central complexes, was introduced and studied in our previous work on Braverman-Kazhdan conjecture. In this note we show that the category of central complexes admits functorial monoidal transfers with respect to morphisms between the dual groups. Combining with the work of Bezrukavnikov-Deshpande, we show that the $\ell$-adic bi-Whittaker categories (resp. the category of vanishing complexes, the category of stable complexes) on reductive groups admit functorial transfers. As an application, we give a new geometric proof of Laumon-Letellier's fromula for transfer maps of stable functions on finite reductive groups.</description>

      <title>A certified classification of first-order controlled coaxial telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to an intrinsic geometrical classification of three-mirror telescopes. The problem is formulated as the study of connected components of a semi-algebraic set that is real solutions of a set of polynomial equations under polynomial inequalities. Under first order approximation, we give the general expression of the transfer matrix of a general optical system composed by N mirrors. Thanks to this representation, for focal telescopes, we express focal, null Petzval's curvature and telecentricity conditions as polynomials equations depending on the inter-mirror distances and mirror magnifications. Eventually, the set of admissible focal telescopes is written as real solutions of aforementioned polynomial equations under non degenerating conditions that are non-null curvatures and non-null magnifications. The set of admissibile afocal telescopes is written analogously. Then, in order to study the topology of these sets, we address the problem of counting and describe their connected components. To achieve this, we consider the canonical projection on a well-chosen parameter space and we split the semi-algebraic set w.r.t the locus of the critical points of the projection restricted to this set. Then, we show that each part projects homeomorphically for N = 3 and we obtain the connected components of the initial set by merging those of each part through the set of critical points of the introduced projection. Besides, in that case, we give the semi-algebraic description of the connected components of the initial set and introduce a topological invariant and a nomenclature which encodes the invariant topological/optical features of optical configurations lying in the same connected component.</description>

      <title>The external activity complex of a pair of matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Schubert variety of a pair of linear subspaces in $\mathbf{C}^n$ and the external activity complex of a pair of not necessarily realizable matroids. Both of these generalize constructions of Ardila et al., which occur when one of the linear spaces is one-dimensional. We prove that our external activity complex is Cohen-Macaulay and deduce a formula for its $K$-polynomial in terms of exterior powers of the dual tautological quotient classes of matroids. As a consequence, we deduce a non-negative formula for the matroid invariant $\omega(M)$ of Fink, Shaw, and Speyer in terms of certain homology groups of links within an external activity complex, proving the 2008 tropical $f$-vector conjecture of Speyer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite monodromy groups of abelian varieties over number fields have been introduced by Grothendieck. They represent the local obstruction to semi-stable reduction. In this paper we prove a criteria for finite groups to be realized as finite monodromy groups in given dimension. An application to the degree of semi-stability gives an effective version of Grothendieck's semi-stable reduction theorem in terms of the degree of the extension with regards to the dimension of the variety.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and the incidence geometry of tropical linear spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian proper position in close analogy to proper position of stable polynomials. Using this notion, we give a new characterization of elementary quotients of M-convex function that parallels the Lorentzian characterization of M-convex functions. We thereby use Lorentzian proper position to study the incidence geometry of tropical linear spaces, and vice versa. In particular, we prove new structural results on the moduli space of codimension-1 tropical linear subspaces of a given tropical linear space and show that it is tropically convex.
  Applying these results, we show that some properties of classical linear incidence geometry fail for tropical linear spaces. For instance, we show that the poset of all matroids on $[n]$, partially ordered by matroid quotient, is not submodular when $n\geq 8$. On the other hand, we introduce a notion of adjoints for tropical linear spaces, generalizing adjoints of matroids, and show that certain incidence properties expected from classical geometry hold for tropical linear spaces that have adjoints.</description>

      <title>A new counterexample to Nguyen's conjecture on surface fibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.10421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $f:S\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$ is a surface fibration of genus $g$ with $3$ singular fibers. If two of the singular fibers are semistable, Nguyen conjectured that $f$ does not exist for $g\ge2$. However, a counterexample for $g=2$ was discovered by Gong-Lu-Tan. Note that such kind of surface fibrations admit strong arithmetic properties but are rare in fact, and as such the counterexamples are important. In this paper, we construct a new one for $g=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \'etale homotopy groups of schemes as defined by Artin and Mazur have the disadvantage of being homotopy invariant only in characteristic zero. This and other related problems led to the definition of the tame topology which is coarser than the \'etale topology by disallowing wild ramification along the boundary of compactifications. The object of this paper is to show that the associated tame homotopy groups are indeed ($\mathbb{A}^1$-)homotopy invariant, at least for regular schemes.</description>

Abstract: We define a basic class of algebras which we call homotopy path algebras. We find that such algebras always admit a cellular resolution and detail the intimate relationship between these algebras, stratifications of topological spaces, and entrance/exit paths. As examples, we prove versions of homological mirror symmetry due to Bondal-Ruan for toric varieties and due to Berglund-H\"ubsch-Krawitz for hypersurfaces with maximal symmetry. We also demonstrate that a form of shellability implies Koszulity and the existence of a minimal cellular resolution. In particular, when the algebra determined by the image of the toric Frobenius morphism is directable, then it is Koszul and admits a minimal cellular resolution.</description>

Along the way, we compute homotopy-invariant non-connective algebraic K-theory with compact support of certain embeddings $X_t \hookrightarrow X_T$ in terms of the motivic realization of the dg category of relatively perfect complexes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct various moduli spaces of K3 surfaces $M$ equipped with a surjective holomorphic map $\pi:M\to\Pb^1$ with generic fiber a complex torus (e.g., an elliptic fibration). Examples include moduli spaces of such maps with primitive fibers; with reduced, irreducible fibers; equipped with a section; etc. Such spaces are closely related to the moduli space of Ricci-flat metrics on $M$. We construct period mappings relating these moduli spaces to locally symmetric spaces, and use these to compute their (orbifold) fundamental groups.
  These results lie in contrast to, and exhibit different behavior than, the well-studied case of moduli spaces of polarized K3 surfaces, and are more useful for applications to the mapping class group $\Mod(M)$. Indeed, we apply our results on moduli space to give two applications to the smooth mapping class group of $M$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we combine sums of squares (SOS) and sums of nonnegative circuit (SONC) forms, two independent nonnegativity certificates for real homogeneous polynomials. We consider the convex cone SOS+SONC of forms that decompose into a sum of an SOS and a SONC form and study it from a geometric point of view. We show that the SOS+SONC cone is proper and neither closed under multiplications nor under linear transformation of variables. Moreover, we present an alternative proof of an analog of Hilbert's 1888 Theorem for the SOS+SONC cone and prove that in the non-Hilbert cases it provides a proper superset of both the SOS and the SONC cone. This follows by exploiting a new necessary condition for membership in the SONC cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a connected reductive algebraic group $G$ and a spherical $G$-variety $X$, a $B$-root subgroup on $X$ is a one-parameter additive group of automorphisms of $X$ normalized by a Borel subgroup $B \subset G$. We obtain a complete description of all $B$-root subgroups on a certain open subset of $X$. When $X$ is horospherical, we extend the construction of standard $B$-root subgroups introduced earlier by Arzhantsev and Avdeev for affine $X$ and obtain a complete description of all standard $B$-root subgroups, which naturally generalizes the well-known description of root subgroups on toric varieties. As an application, for horospherical $X$ that is either complete or contains a unique closed $G$-orbit, we determine all $G$-stable prime divisors in $X$ that can be connected with the open $G$-orbit via the action of a suitable $B$-root subgroup. For horospherical $X$, we also find sufficient conditions for the existence of $B$-root subgroups on $X$ that preserve the open $B$-orbit in $X$. Finally, when $G$ is of semisimple rank $1$ and $X$ is horospherical and complete, we determine all $B$-root subgroups on $X$, which enables us to describe the Lie algebra of the connected automorphism group of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a conjecture regarding the integrally closedness of lattice polytopes with large lattice lengths. We demonstrate that a lattice simplex in dimension 3 (resp. 4) with lattice length of at least 2 (resp. 3 and no edge has lattice length 5) can be covered by dilated simplices of the form $sQ$, where integer $s\ge 2$ (resp. 3) and $Q$ is a lattice simplex. The covering property implies these simplices are integrally closed. As an application, we obtain a simple criterion for the projective normality of ample line bundles on 3-(resp. 4-) dimensional $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial toric Fano varieties with Picard number one. Along the way, we discover certain unexpected phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Gushel-Mukai manifolds are specific families of $n$-dimensional Fano manifolds of Picard rank $1$ and index $n-2$ where $3\leq n \leq 6$. A Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is either ordinary, i.e. a hyperquadric section of a quintic Del Pezzo $(n+1)$-fold, or special, i.e. it admits a double cover over the quintic Del Pezzo $n$-fold branched along an ordinary Gushel-Mukai $(n-1)$-fold. In this paper, we prove that a general special Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is K-stable for every $3\leq n\leq 6$. Furthermore, we give a description of the first and last walls of the K-moduli of the pair $(M,cQ)$, where $M$ is the quintic Del Pezzo fourfold (or fivefold) and $Q$ is an ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefold (or fourfold). Besides, we compute $\delta$-invariants of quintic Del Pezzo fourfolds and fivefolds which were shown to be K-unstable by K. Fujita, and show that they admit K\"ahler-Ricci solitons.</description>

      <title>Locally Trivial Deformations of Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study locally trivial deformations of toric varieties from a combinatorial point of view. For any fan $\Sigma$, we construct a deformation functor $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ by considering \v{C}ech zero-cochains on certain simplicial complexes. We show that under appropriate hypotheses, $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Def}'_{X_\Sigma}$, the functor of locally trivial deformations for the toric variety $X_\Sigma$ associated to $\Sigma$. In particular, for any complete toric variety $X$ that is smooth in codimension $2$ and $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial in codimension $3$, there exists a fan $\Sigma$ such that $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Def}_X$, the functor of deformations of $X$. We apply these results to give a new criterion for a smooth complete toric variety to have unobstructed deformations, and to compute formulas for higher order obstructions, generalizing a formula of Ilten and Turo for the cup product. We use the functor $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ to explicitly compute the deformation spaces for a number of toric varieties, and provide examples exhibiting previously unobserved phenomena. In particular, we classify exactly which toric threefolds arising as iterated $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles have unobstructed deformation space.</description>

      <title>On Poincar\'e polynomials for plane curves with quasi-homogeneous singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a combinatorial object that can be associated with any conic-line arrangement with ordinary singularities, which we call the combinatorial Poincar\'e polynomial. We prove a Terao-type factorization statement on the splitting of such a polynomial over the rationals under the assumption that our conic-line arrangements are free and admit ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities. Then we focus on the so-called $d$-arrangements in the plane. In particular, we provide a combinatorial constraint for free $d$-arrangements admitting ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic $\bf{\partial\bar\partial}$-lemma and several geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a $\partial\bar{\partial}$-type lemma on compact K\"ahler manifolds for logarithmic differential forms valued in the dual of a certain pseudo-effective line bundle, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed by X. Wan.
  We then derive several applications, including strengthened results by H. Esnault-E. Viehweg on the degeneracy of the spectral sequence at the $E_1$-stage for projective manifolds associated with the logarithmic de Rham complex, as well as by L. Katzarkov-M. Kontsevich-T. Pantev on the unobstructed locally trivial deformations of a projective generalized log Calabi-Yau pair with some weights, both of which are extended to the broader context of compact K\"ahler manifolds.
  Furthermore, we establish the K\"ahler version of an injectivity theorem originally formulated by F. Ambro in the algebraic setting. Notably, while O. Fujino previously addressed the K\"ahler case, our proof takes a different approach by avoiding the reliance on mixed Hodge structures for cohomology with compact support.</description>

      <title>Vanishing sheaves and the geometric Whittaker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$ and let $\ell$ be a prime number different from $p$. Let $U\subset G$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup, and let $T$ be a maximal torus normalizing $U$ with normalizer $N=N_G(T)$. Let $W=N/T$ be the Weyl group of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a non-degenerate $\ell$-adic multiplicative local system on $U$. In this paper we prove that the bi-Whittaker category, namely the triangulated monoidal category of $(U,\mathcal{L})$-bi-equivariant complexes on $G$, is monoidally equivalent to an explicit thick triangulated monoidal subcategory $\mathscr{D}^\circ_W(T)\subset \mathscr{D}_W(T)$ of ''$W$-equivariant central sheaves'' on the torus, answering a question raised by Drinfeld. In particular, the bi-Whittaker category has the structure of a symmetric monoidal category. We also study a certain thick triangulated monoidal subcategory $\mathscr{D}^\circ_G(G)\subset \mathscr{D}_G(G)$ of ''vanishing sheaves'' and prove that it is braided monoidally equivalent to an explicit thick triangulated monoidal subcategory $\mathscr{D}^\circ_N(T)\subset \mathscr{D}_N(T)$ of ''$N$-equivariant central sheaves'' on the torus. The above equivalence is given by an enhancement of the parabolic restriction functor restricted to the subcategory $\mathscr{D}^\circ_G(G)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper new Steiner systems $S(2,6,121)$, $S(2,6,126)$ are introduced. Also some non-existence results for line lengths $7..11$ are presented. There is no solid proof that presented algorithm is exhaustive or correct, but it produces same results on already known difference families for line lengths $3..6$. Due to calculation-based approach this paper probably won't be published, but will be submitted to arxiv as it contains some new results</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Calabi-Yau four folds with hybrid and recurrent neural network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report the results of applying deep learning based on hybrid convolutional-recurrent and purely recurrent neural network architectures to the dataset of almost one million complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds (CICY4) to machine-learn their four Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$. In particular, we explored and experimented with twelve different neural network models, nine of which are convolutional-recurrent (CNN-RNN) hybrids with the RNN unit being either GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The remaining four models are purely recurrent neural networks based on LSTM. In terms of the $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$ prediction accuracies, at 72% training ratio, our best performing individual model is CNN-LSTM-400, a hybrid CNN-LSTM with the LSTM hidden size of 400, which obtained 99.74%, 98.07%, 95.19%, 81.01%, our second best performing individual model is LSTM-448, an LSTM-based model with the hidden size of 448, which obtained 99.74%, 97.51%, 94.24%, and 78.63%. These results were improved by forming ensembles of the top two, three or even four models. Our best ensemble, consisting of the top four models, achieved the accuracies of 99.84%, 98.71%, 96.26%, 85.03%. At 80% training ratio, the top two performing models LSTM-448 and LSTM-424 are both LSTM-based with the hidden sizes of 448 and 424. Compared with the 72% training ratio, there is a significant improvement of accuracies, which reached 99.85%, 98.66%, 96.26%, 84.77% for the best individual model and 99.90%, 99.03%, 97.97%, 87.34% for the best ensemble. By nature a proof of concept, the results of this work conclusively established the utility of RNN-based architectures and demonstrated their effective performances compared to the well-explored purely CNN-based architectures in the problem of deep learning Calabi Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Chirotropical Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in particle physics have revealed deep connections between scattering amplitudes and tropical geometry. From the heart of this relationship emerged the chirotropical Grassmannian $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(k,n)$ and the chirotropical Dressian $\text{Dr}^\chi(k,n)$, polyhedral fans built from uniform realizable chirotopes that encode the combinatorial structure of Generalized Feynman Diagrams. We prove that $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n) = \text{Dr}^\chi(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$, and develop algorithms to compute these objects from their rays modulo lineality. Using these algorithms, we compute all chirotropical Grassmannians $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$ across all isomorphism classes of chirotopes. We prove that each chirotopal configuration space $X^\chi(3,6)$ is diffeomorphic to a polytope and propose an associated canonical logarithmic differential form. Finally, we show that the equality between chirotropical Grassmannian and Dressian fails for $(k,n) = (4,8)$.</description>
