      <title>Predicting potato plant vigor from the seed tuber properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vigor of potato plants, defined as the canopy area at the end of the exponential growth stage, depends on the origin and physiological state of the seed tuber. Experiments carried out with six potato varieties in three test fields over three years show that there is a 73%-90% correlation in the vigor of the plants from the same seedlot grown in different test fields. However, these correlations are not always observed on the level of individual varieties and vanish or become negative when the seed tubers and young plants experience environmental stress. A comprehensive study of the association between the vigor and the seed tuber biochemistry has revealed that, while 50%-70% of the variation in the plant vigor is explained by the tuber data, the vigor is dominated by the potato genotype. Analysis of individual predictors, such as the abundance of a particular metabolite, indicates that the vigor enhancing properties of the seed tubers differ between genotypes. Variety-specific models show that, for some varieties, up to 30% of the vigor variation within the variety is explained by and can be predicted from the tuber biochemistry, whereas, for other varieties, the association between the tuber composition and the vigor is much weaker.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Enhanced Disease Spread Dynamics Over Time and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a neural network-enhanced approach to modeling disease spread dynamics over time and space. Neural networks are used to estimate time-varying parameters, with two calibration methods explored: Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) with Trust Region Reflective (TRF) optimization, and backpropagation with the Adam optimizer. Simulations show that the second method is faster for larger networks, while the first offers a greater diversity of acceptable solutions. The model is extended spatially by introducing a pathogen compartment, which diffuses through environmental transmission and interpersonal contact. We examine scenarios of exact reporting, overreporting, and underreporting, highlighting their effects on public behavior and infection peaks. Our results demonstrate that neural network-enhanced models more accurately capture dynamic changes in disease spread and illustrate the potential of scientific machine learning (SciML) to improve the predictive power of epidemiological models beyond traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Robust Segmentation of CPR-Induced Capnogram Using U-net: Overcoming Challenges with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The accurate segmentation of capnograms during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential for effective patient monitoring and advanced airway management. This study aims to develop a robust algorithm using a U-net architecture to segment capnograms into inhalation and non-inhalation phases, and to demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art (SoA) methods in the presence of CPR-induced artifacts.
  Materials and methods: A total of 24354 segments of one minute extracted from 1587 patients were used to train and evaluate the model. The proposed U-net architecture was tested using patient-wise 10-fold cross-validation. A set of five features was extracted for clustering analysis to evaluate the algorithm performance across different signal characteristics and contexts. The evaluation metrics included segmentation-level and ventilation-level metrics, including ventilation rate and end-tidal-CO$_2$ values.
  Results: The proposed U-net based algorithm achieved an F1-score of 98% for segmentation and 96% for ventilation detection, outperforming existing SoA methods by 4 points. The root mean square error for end-tidal-CO$_2$ and ventilation rate were 1.9 mmHg and 1.1 breaths per minute, respectively.
  Detailed performance metrics highlighted the algorithm's robustness against CPR-induced interferences and low amplitude signals. Clustering analysis further demonstrated consistent performance across various signal characteristics.
  Conclusion: The proposed U-net based segmentation algorithm improves the accuracy of capnogram analysis during CPR. Its enhanced performance in detecting inhalation phases and ventilation events offers a reliable tool for clinical applications, potentially improving patient outcomes during cardiac arrest.</description>

      <title>Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. That approach consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the large PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality.</description>

      <title>ProtSCAPE: Mapping the landscape of protein conformations in molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of protein structures is essential for comprehending their biological functions. While significant progress has been made in predicting static folded structures, modeling protein motions on microsecond to millisecond scales remains challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Protein Transformer with Scattering, Attention, and Positional Embedding (ProtSCAPE), which leverages the geometric scattering transform alongside transformer-based attention mechanisms to capture protein dynamics from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. ProtSCAPE utilizes the multi-scale nature of the geometric scattering transform to extract features from protein structures conceptualized as graphs and integrates these features with dual attention structures that focus on residues and amino acid signals, generating latent representations of protein trajectories. Furthermore, ProtSCAPE incorporates a regression head to enforce temporally coherent latent representations.</description>

      <title>Atrial Fibrillation Detection System via Acoustic Sensing for Mobile Phones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by irregular electrical impulses originating in the atria, which can lead to severe complications and even death. Due to the intermittent nature of the AF, early and timely monitoring of AF is critical for patients to prevent further exacerbation of the condition. Although ambulatory ECG Holter monitors provide accurate monitoring, the high cost of these devices hinders their wider adoption. Current mobile-based AF detection systems offer a portable solution, however, these systems have various applicability issues such as being easily affected by environmental factors and requiring significant user effort. To overcome the above limitations, we present MobileAF, a novel smartphone-based AF detection system using speakers and microphones. In order to capture minute cardiac activities, we propose a multi-channel pulse wave probing method. In addition, we enhance the signal quality by introducing a three-stage pulse wave purification pipeline. What's more, a ResNet-based network model is built to implement accurate and reliable AF detection. We collect data from 23 participants utilizing our data collection application on the smartphone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our system, with 97.9% accuracy, 96.8% precision, 97.2% recall, 98.3% specificity, and 97.0% F1 score.</description>

      <title>BSD: a Bayesian framework for parametric models of neural spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of neural power spectra plays a crucial role in understanding brain function and dysfunction. While recent efforts have led to the development of methods for decomposing spectral data, challenges remain in performing statistical analysis and group-level comparisons. Here, we introduce Bayesian Spectral Decomposition (BSD), a Bayesian framework for analysing neural spectral power. BSD allows for the specification, inversion, comparison, and analysis of parametric models of neural spectra, addressing limitations of existing methods. We first establish the face validity of BSD on simulated data and show how it outperforms an established method (\fooof{}) for peak detection on artificial spectral data. We then demonstrate the efficacy of BSD on a group-level study of EEG spectra in 204 healthy subjects from the LEMON dataset. Our results not only highlight the effectiveness of BSD in model selection and parameter estimation, but also illustrate how BSD enables straightforward group-level regression of the effect of continuous covariates such as age. By using Bayesian inference techniques, BSD provides a robust framework for studying neural spectral data and their relationship to brain function and dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Push-Forward Signed Distance Functions enable interpretable and robust continuous shape quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Push-Forward Signed Distance Morphometric (PF-SDM), a novel method for shape quantification in biomedical imaging that is continuous, interpretable, and invariant to shape-preserving transformations. PF-SDM effectively captures the geometric properties of shapes, including their topological skeletons and radial symmetries. This results in a robust and interpretable shape descriptor that generalizes to capture temporal shape dynamics. Importantly, PF-SDM avoids certain issues of previous geometric morphometrics, like Elliptical Fourier Analysis and Generalized Procrustes Analysis, such as coefficient correlations and landmark choices. We present the PF-SDM theory, provide a practically computable algorithm, and benchmark it on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Enhanced Mutation Mastery: Augmenting Zero-Shot Prediction of Protein Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzyme engineering enables the modification of wild-type proteins to meet industrial and research demands by enhancing catalytic activity, stability, binding affinities, and other properties. The emergence of deep learning methods for protein modeling has demonstrated superior results at lower costs compared to traditional approaches such as directed evolution and rational design. In mutation effect prediction, the key to pre-training deep learning models lies in accurately interpreting the complex relationships among protein sequence, structure, and function. This study introduces a retrieval-enhanced protein language model for comprehensive analysis of native properties from sequence and local structural interactions, as well as evolutionary properties from retrieved homologous sequences. The state-of-the-art performance of the proposed ProtREM is validated on over 2 million mutants across 217 assays from an open benchmark (ProteinGym). We also conducted post-hoc analyses of the model's ability to improve the stability and binding affinity of a VHH antibody. Additionally, we designed 10 new mutants on a DNA polymerase and conducted wet-lab experiments to evaluate their enhanced activity at higher temperatures. Both in silico and experimental evaluations confirmed that our method provides reliable predictions of mutation effects, offering an auxiliary tool for biologists aiming to evolve existing enzymes. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/tyang816/ProtREM.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference: Diffusion Models as Expressive Variational Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI), a black-box variational inference algorithm for latent variable models which relies on diffusion models as flexible approximate posteriors. Specifically, our method introduces an expressive class of diffusion-based variational posteriors that perform iterative refinement in latent space; we train these posteriors with a novel regularized evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the marginal likelihood inspired by the wake-sleep algorithm. Our method is easy to implement (it fits a regularized extension of the ELBO), is compatible with black-box variational inference, and outperforms alternative classes of approximate posteriors based on normalizing flows or adversarial networks. We find that DDVI improves inference and learning in deep latent variable models across common benchmarks as well as on a motivating task in biology -- inferring latent ancestry from human genomes -- where it outperforms strong baselines on the Thousand Genomes dataset.</description>

      <title>Pruning neural network models for gene regulatory dynamics using data and domain knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The practical utility of machine learning models in the sciences often hinges on their interpretability. It is common to assess a model's merit for scientific discovery, and thus novel insights, by how well it aligns with already available domain knowledge--a dimension that is currently largely disregarded in the comparison of neural network models. While pruning can simplify deep neural network architectures and excels in identifying sparse models, as we show in the context of gene regulatory network inference, state-of-the-art techniques struggle with biologically meaningful structure learning. To address this issue, we propose DASH, a generalizable framework that guides network pruning by using domain-specific structural information in model fitting and leads to sparser, better interpretable models that are more robust to noise. Using both synthetic data with ground truth information, as well as real-world gene expression data, we show that DASH, using knowledge about gene interaction partners within the putative regulatory network, outperforms general pruning methods by a large margin and yields deeper insights into the biological systems being studied.</description>

      <title>Virtual Lung Screening Trial (VLST): An In Silico Replica of the National Lung Screening Trial for Lung Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: To demonstrate that a virtual imaging trial platform can accurately emulate a major clinical trial, specifically the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) that compared computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR) imaging for lung cancer screening.
  Design, Setting, and Participants: A virtual patient population of 294 subjects was created from human models (XCAT) emulating the NLST, with two types of simulated cancerous lung nodules. Each virtual patient in the cohort was assessed using simulated CT and CXR systems to generate images reflecting the NLST imaging technologies. Deep learning models trained for lesion detection, AI CT-Reader, and AI CXR-Reader served as virtual readers.
  Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the difference in the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (AUC) for CT and CXR modalities.
  Results: The study analyzed paired CT and CXR simulated images from 294 virtual patients. The AI CT-Reader outperformed the AI CXR-Reader across all levels of analysis. At the patient level, CT demonstrated superior diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90 to 0.95), compared to CXR AUC of 0.72 (0.67 to 0.77). Subgroup analyses of lesion types revealed CT had significantly better detection of homogeneous lesions (AUC 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95 to 0.98) compared to heterogeneous lesions(0.89; 0.86 to 0.93). Furthermore, when the specificity of the AI CT-Reader was adjusted to match the NLST sensitivity of 94% for CT, the VLST results closely mirrored the NLST findings, further highlighting the alignment between the two studies.
  Conclusion and Relevance: The VIT results closely replicated those of the earlier NLST, underscoring its potential to replicate real clinical imaging trials. Integration of virtual trials may aid in the evaluation and improvement of imaging-based diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Monte Carlo methods for three-dimensional diffusive capture problems in exterior domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular scale decision making is modulated by the dynamics of signalling molecules and their diffusive trajectories from a source to small absorbing sites on the cellular surface. Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</description>

Abstract: Generating ligand molecules for specific protein targets, known as structure-based drug design, is a fundamental problem in therapeutics development and biological discovery. Recently, target-aware generative models, especially diffusion models, have shown great promise in modeling protein-ligand interactions and generating candidate drugs. However, existing models primarily focus on learning the chemical distribution of all drug candidates, which lacks effective steerability on the chemical quality of model generations. In this paper, we propose a novel and general alignment framework to align pretrained target diffusion models with preferred functional properties, named AliDiff. AliDiff shifts the target-conditioned chemical distribution towards regions with higher binding affinity and structural rationality, specified by user-defined reward functions, via the preference optimization approach. To avoid the overfitting problem in common preference optimization objectives, we further develop an improved Exact Energy Preference Optimization method to yield an exact and efficient alignment of the diffusion models, and provide the closed-form expression for the converged distribution. Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that AliDiff can generate molecules with state-of-the-art binding energies with up to -7.07 Avg. Vina Score, while maintaining strong molecular properties. Code is available at https://github.com/MinkaiXu/AliDiff.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of systematically determining and characterizing the degree of confidence in computational model predictions. In the context of systems biology, especially with dynamic models, UQ is crucial because it addresses the challenges posed by nonlinearity and parameter sensitivity, allowing us to properly understand and extrapolate the behavior of complex biological systems. Here, we focus on dynamic models represented by deterministic nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Many current UQ approaches in this field rely on Bayesian statistical methods. While powerful, these methods often require strong prior specifications and make parametric assumptions that may not always hold in biological systems. Additionally, these methods face challenges in domains where sample sizes are limited, and statistical inference becomes constrained, with computational speed being a bottleneck in large models of biological systems. As an alternative, we propose the use of conformal inference methods, introducing two novel algorithms that, in some instances, offer non-asymptotic guarantees, enhancing robustness and scalability across various applications. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms through several scenarios, highlighting their advantages over traditional Bayesian approaches. The proposed methods show promising results for diverse biological data structures and scenarios, offering a general framework to quantify uncertainty for dynamic models of biological systems.The software for the methodology and the reproduction of the results is available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13644870.</description>
