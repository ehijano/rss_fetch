      <title>Advancing Biomedical Applications: Antioxidant and Biocompatible Cerium Oxide Nanoparticle-Integrated Poly-{\epsilon}- caprolactone Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are expressed at high levels in many diseases, can be scavenged by cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2NPs). CeO2NPs can cause significant cytotoxicity when administered directly to cells, but this cytotoxicity can be reduced if CeO2NPs can be encapsulated in biocompatible polymers. In this study, CeO2NPs were synthesized using a one-stage process, then purified, characterized, and then encapsulated into an electrospun poly-{\epsilon}-caprolactone (PCL) scaffold. The direct administration of CeO2NPs to RAW 264.7 Macrophages resulted in reduced ROS levels but lower cell viability. Conversely, the encapsulation of nanoceria in a PCL scaffold was shown to lower ROS levels and improve cell survival. The study demonstrated an effective technique for encapsulating nanoceria in PCL fiber and confirmed its biocompatibility and efficacy. This system has the potential to be utilized for developing tissue engineering scaffolds, targeted delivery of therapeutic CeO2NPs, wound healing, and other biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Season combinatorial intervention predictions with Salt &amp; Peper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interventions play a pivotal role in the study of complex biological systems. In drug discovery, genetic interventions (such as CRISPR base editing) have become central to both identifying potential therapeutic targets and understanding a drug's mechanism of action. With the advancement of CRISPR and the proliferation of genome-scale analyses such as transcriptomics, a new challenge is to navigate the vast combinatorial space of concurrent genetic interventions. Addressing this, our work concentrates on estimating the effects of pairwise genetic combinations on the cellular transcriptome. We introduce two novel contributions: Salt, a biologically-inspired baseline that posits the mostly additive nature of combination effects, and Peper, a deep learning model that extends Salt's additive assumption to achieve unprecedented accuracy. Our comprehensive comparison against existing state-of-the-art methods, grounded in diverse metrics, and our out-of-distribution analysis highlight the limitations of current models in realistic settings. This analysis underscores the necessity for improved modelling techniques and data acquisition strategies, paving the way for more effective exploration of genetic intervention effects.</description>
