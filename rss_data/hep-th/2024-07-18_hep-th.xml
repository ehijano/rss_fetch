      <title>Stringy Forces in the Black Hole Interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories break down inside large black holes on macroscopic scales when tidal forces are string-sized. If $r_0$ is the horizon radius and $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale, the 4D Schwarzschild interior is strongly curved at $ \big(r_0 \alpha' \big)^{1/3}$. Infalling massless probes that reach this scale stretch and become excited strings. I generalize this picture for a wide class of black hole solutions in string theory. For the black hole dual to the large-$N$ BFSS model, and denoting $\ell_P$ the Planck length, tidal forces are stringy at $r_0 \left(\frac{r_0}{N^{1/3} \ell_P}\right)^{3/11}$, which is greater than the scale where string perturbation theory breaks down. For 4D Kerr, there is a range of spin parameters for which the inner horizon is to the future of the scale of stringy curvature.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct cosmological spacetimes with a self-dual Weyl tensor whose dynamics are described by conformally coupled scalars with only cubic self-interactions. Similar to the previously discovered cases in flat and (Anti) de Sitter backgrounds, the interactions are characterized by a bracket that encodes a kinematic algebra. We discuss how the color-kinematics duality and double copy are realized in these cosmological backgrounds. If we further impose that the Ricci scalar is that of an FLRW spacetime, we find two new self-dual metrics corresponding to radiation-dominated and coasting (non-accelerating) FLRW backgrounds. Relaxing this requirement, we find an infinite family of solutions given by three different conformal classes of cosmological self-dual metrics. These solutions approximate those of FLRW as long as we impose a simple additional constraint on the scalar theory.</description>

      <title>The Two-loop MHV Momentum Amplituhedron from Fibrations of Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new approach to computing the canonical forms of the momentum amplituhedron in dual-momentum space was proposed by the authors. These are relevant for the integrands of scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 super-Yang-Mills. At one-loop the idea was to view the set of all loop momenta, which we refer to as the one-loop fiber geometry, as a fibration over the tree-level kinematic data. This led to the notion of tree-level chambers, subsets of the tree-level kinematic space for which the combinatorial structure of the one-loop fiber remains unchanged, that allowed for a novel representation of the one-loop integrand. The goal of this paper is to extend these ideas to two loops for MHV integrands. Our approach will be to view the geometry accessed by the second loop momentum, similarly referred to as the two-loop fiber geometry, as a fibration over both the one-loop kinematic data and the position of the first loop momentum in the one-loop fiber. This will lead to the notion of one-loop chambers, subsets of the one-loop fibers for which the combinatorial structure of the two-loop fiber remains unchanged. We will characterise the full set of one-loop chambers and their corresponding two-loop fibers and present formulae for their canonical forms. Ultimately, this will result in a new formula for the two-loop MHV integrand written as a fibration of fibration.</description>

      <title>Strings near black holes are Carrollian -- Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical closed bosonic strings probing the near-horizon region of a non-extremal black hole and show that this corresponds to understanding string theory in the Carroll regime. This is done by first performing a Carroll expansion and then a near-horizon expansion of a closed relativistic string, subsequently showing that they agree. Concretely, we expand the phase space action in powers of $c^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light, assuming that the target space admits a string Carroll expansion (where two directions are singled out) and show that there exist two different Carroll strings: a magnetic and an electric string. The magnetic string has a Lorentzian worldsheet, whereas the worldsheet of the electric string is Carrollian. The geometry near the horizon of a four-dimensional (4D) Schwarzschild black hole takes the form of a string Carroll expansion (a 2D Rindler space fibred over a 2-sphere). We show that the solution space of relativistic strings near the horizon bifurcates and the two sectors precisely match with the magnetic/electric Carroll strings with an appropriate target space. Magnetic Carroll strings near a black hole shrink to a point on the two-sphere and either follow null geodesics or turn into folded strings on the 2D Rindler spacetime. Electric Carroll strings wrap the two-sphere and follow a massive geodesic in the Rindler space. Finally, we show that 4D non-extremal Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes also admit string Carroll expansions near their outer horizons, indicating that our formulation extends to generic non-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>T-duality for non-critical heterotic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-critical heterotic strings compactified on $S^1$. For full rank theories, they are related to odd self-dual lattices and are structurally of the same form as the critical non-supersymmetric theories. For dimensions up to 14 the associated moduli spaces are Coxeter polytopes already studied by Vinberg and Kaplinskaya. In the heterotic string context, the Coxeter diagrams of these moduli spaces are related through transformations representing the process of dimension changing tachyon condensation of Hellerman-Swanson. For dimensions 8 and 6 respectively on $S^1$ and $T^2$ we show that at special points in the moduli space the subcritical string is the CHS background for two coincident NS5-branes and the intersection of two such pairs. These configurations are interpreted as an end result of condensing heterotic winding tachyons along one or two Scherck-Schwarz circles at self-dual radius. We give evidence that in the first case there is a T-duality between the pair of NS5-branes and a recently constructed non-supersymmetric heterotic 6-brane.</description>

      <title>A note on the large-$c$ conformal block asymptotics and $\alpha$-heavy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $\alpha$-heavy conformal operators in CFT$_2$ which dimensions grow as $h = O(c^\alpha)$ with $\alpha$ being non-negative rational number and conjecture that the large-$c$ asymptotics of the respective 4-point Virasoro conformal block is exponentiated similar to the standard case of $\alpha=1$. It is shown that the leading exponent is given by a Puiseux polynomial which is a linear combination of power functions in the central charge with fractional powers decreasing from $\alpha$ to $0$ according to some pattern. Our analysis is limited by considering the first six explicit coefficients of the Virasoro block function in the coordinate. For simplicity, external primary operators are chosen to be of equal conformal dimensions that, therefore, includes the case of the vacuum conformal block. The consideration is also extended to the 4-point ${\cal W}_3$ conformal block of four semi-degenerate operators, in which case the exponentiation hypothesis works the same way. Here, only the first three block coefficients can be treated analytically.</description>

      <title>$p$-Chords, Wee-Chords, and de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of us (L.S.) and H. Verlinde independently conjectured a holographic duality between the double-scaled SYK model at infinite temperature and dimensionally reduced $(2+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space [1]-[8]. Beyond the statement that such a duality exists there was deep disagreement between the two proposals [9]. In this note, we trace the origin of the disagreement to a superficial similarity between two q-deformed algebraic structures: the algebra of "chords" in DSSYK, and the algebra of line operators in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D de Sitter gravity. Assuming that these two structures are the same requires an identification of parameters [7][10] which leads to a collapse of the separation of scales [9] -- the separation being required by the semiclassical limit [3][9]. Dropping that assumption restores the separation of scales but leaves unexplained the relation between chords and Chern-Simons line operators. In this note we point out the existence of a third q-deformed algebra that appears in DSSYK: the algebra of ``wee-chords." Identifying the Chern-Simons line operators with wee-chords removes the discrepancy and leads to a satisfying relation between the two sides of the duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of local de Sitter thermodynamics into $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity provides a new basis to unify the dielectric and electroweak vacua. We suggest the electroweak theory emerges from the ergodic mixing of charge density under local de Sitter thermodynamics and introduce the concept of lab-accessible topological defects.</description>

      <title>Superconformal Indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superconformal index of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories on $S^1\times_{\omega} S^2$ in the Cardy-like limit where the radius of the $S^1$ is much smaller than that of the $S^2$. We show that the first two leading terms in this Cardy-like expansion are dictated by the Bethe Ansatz formulation of the topologically twisted index of the same theory. We apply this relation to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic superconformal field theories describing the low-energy dynamics of $N$ M2-branes and derive closed form expressions, valid to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion, for the two leading terms in the Cardy-like expansion of the superconformal index. We also discuss the implications of our results for the entropy of supersymmetric Kerr-Newman black holes in AdS$_4$ and the four-derivative corrections to 4d gauged supergravity.</description>

      <title>Criticality of global monopole charges in diverse dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct charged AdS black holes with a global monopole charge in diverse dimensions and study the thermodynamics. We find a critical monopole charge below which the solution exhibits Van-der Waals like behaviors. In the context of holography, this could be intepreted using the boundary degrees of freedoms. As an example, we study the phase diagram in the four dimensions analytically. We further analyze the microstructures of the solution using Ruppeiner geometry. We find that repulsive interactions dominates for black holes in a wide range of temperatures. However, around the critical point, attractive interactions is dominant and the Ruppeiner scalar curvature shows universal behaviors: it has a critical exponent $2$ and coefficient $-1/8$ in diverse dimensions. Universality of the results is interpreted from the scaling behavior of free energy near the critical point for Van-der Waals like fluids.</description>

      <title>$O(9,25)$ symmetry of heterotic string theory at orders $\alpha'$, $\alpha'^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study, we have observed that by imposing a truncated T-duality transformation on the circular reduction of the bosonic couplings in the heterotic theory at four- and six-derivative orders, we can calculate these couplings in a particular YM gauge where the YM potential vanishes but its field strength remains non-zero. Importantly, the coupling constants are independent of the gauge choice, so these results are valid across different YM gauge choices.
  In this work, we explore the cosmological reduction of these couplings when the YM gauge fields belong to the Cartan subalgebra of $SO(32)$ or $E_8 \times E_8$. We demonstrate that after applying appropriate one-dimensional field redefinitions and total derivative terms, the couplings can be expressed in a proposed $O(9,25)$-invariant canonical form, which is the extension of the canonical $O(9,9)$-invariant form for just the NS-NS fields proposed by Hohm and Zwiebach. This $O(9,25)$-invariant expression is in terms of the trace of the first time derivative of the generalized metric, which encompasses both the YM field and the NS-NS fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The defect-type solutions of a deformed $O(2N+1)$ linear sigma model with a real and $N$ complex fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime are studied. All the solutions are analytically found for the $N=2$ case. Two types of solitons have been determined: (a) Simple solutions formed by a topological kink with or without the presence of a $Q$-ball. (b) Composite solutions. They are constituted by some one-parameter families of solutions which can be understood as a non-linear combination of simple solutions. The properties of all of those solutions and the analysis of their linear stability, as well as decay channels, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropy of black holes, charged probes and noncommutative generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brick wall model is a semi-classical approach to understanding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy. We outline the formalism for the brick wall model in arbitrary number of dimensions and generalize it to include both charged spacetimes and charged probes in order to systematically show how to calculate the entropy for any black hole, in higher orders of the WKB approximation. We calculate the entropy for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and charged BTZ black holes, and by looking at the chargeless limits we recover the entropy of the Schwarzschild and neutral BTZ black holes. We also study noncommutative corrections to the black hole entropy by using a Drinfeld twist to deform spacetime symmetries. Using the noncommutative action for a charged scalar field, we derive the noncommutative Klein-Gordon equation and the radial equation in arbitrary dimension on which we generalize the brick wall method. We study case by case the noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and noncommutative charged BTZ black holes, the entropy of which we calculate using the generalized brick wall method. Corrections due to higher order in the WKB approximation arise, and they are given by the logarithms of the black hole area. The corrections in the lowest order of WKB due to noncommutativity are also given by the logarithms of the black hole area.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of fermion chain in double-scaled SYK and power spectrum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity of the fermion chain operator which consists of multiple Majorana fermions in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model with finite temperature. Using the fact that Krylov complexity is computable from two-point functions, the analysis is performed in the limit where the two-point function becomes simple and we compare the results with those of other previous studies. We confirm the exponential growth of Krylov complexity in the very low temperature regime. In general, Krylov complexity grows at most linearly at very late times in any system with a bounded energy spectrum. Therefore, we have to focus on the initial growth to see differences in the behaviors of systems or operators. Since the DSSYK model is such a bounded system, its chaotic nature can be expected to appear as the initial exponential growth of the Krylov complexity. In particular, the time at which the initial exponential growth of Krylov complexity terminates is independent of the number of degrees of freedom. Based on the above, we systematically and specifically study the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity using a toy power spectrum and deepen our understanding of those initial behaviors. In particular, we confirm that the overall sech-like behavior of the power spectrum shows the initial linear growth of the Lanczos coefficient, even when the energy spectrum is bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consanguinity of entropy and complexity is pointed out through the example of coherent states of the $SL(2,\C)$ group. Both are obtained from the K\"ahler potential of the underlying geometry of the sphere corresponding to the Fubini-Study metric. Entropy is shown to be equal to the K\"ahler potential written in terms of dual symplectic variables as the Guillemin potential for toric manifolds. The logarithm of complexity relating two states is shown to be equal to Calabi's diastasis function. Optimality of the Fubini-Study metric is indicated by considering its deformation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy for the Black 0-Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement entropy between the Black 0-Brane solution to supergravity and its Hawking radiation. The Black 0-Brane admits a dual Gauge theory description in terms of the Matrix model for M-Theory, named BFSS theory, which is the theory of open strings on a collection of N D0-branes. Recent studies of the model have highlighted a mechanism of Black Hole evaporation for this system, based on the chaotic nature of the theory and the existence of flat directions. This paper further explores this idea, through the computation of the von Neumann entropy of Hawking radiation. In particular, we show that the expected Page curve is indeed reproduced, consistently with a complete recovery of information after the Black Hole has fully evaporated. A pivotal step in the computation is the definition of a Hilbert space which allows for a quantum mechanical description of partially evaporated Black Holes. We find that the entanglement entropy depends on the choice of a parameter, which can be interpreted as summarizing the geometric features of the Black Hole, such as the size of the resolved singularity and the size of the horizon.</description>

      <title>The maxcut of the sunrise with different masses in the continuous Minkoskean dimensional regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the maxcut of the two loops sunrise amplitude with three different masses by using the Minkoskean (as opposed to the usual Euclidean) continuous dimension regularisation, obtaining in that way six related but different functions expressed in the form of one-dimensional finite integrals. We then consider the $4$th order homogeneous equation valid for the maxcut,and show that for arbitrary dimension $d$ the six functions do satisfy the equation. We further discuss the $d=2,3,4$ cases, verifying that only four of them are linearly independent. The equal mass limit is also shortly discussed.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Black Hole Hair and AdS_3 x S^3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4D-5D connection allows us to view the same near horizon geometry as part of a 4D black hole or a 5D black hole. A much studied example of this phenomenon is the BMPV black hole uplifted to 6D with flat base space versus Taub-NUT base space. These black holes have identical near horizon AdS_3 x S^3 geometry. In this paper, we study modes in AdS_3 x S^3 and identify those that correspond to supersymmetric hair modes in the full black hole spacetimes. We show that these modes satisfy non-normalisable boundary conditions in AdS_3. The non-normalisable boundary conditions are different for different hair modes. We also discuss how the supersymmetric hair modes on BMPV black holes fit into the classification of supersymmetric solutions of 6D supergravity.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein discreteness of the entropy: Symmetrical bath and CFT subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the entanglement entropy of CFT systems in contact with large bath system, such that the complete system lives on the boundary of $AdS_{d+1}$ spacetime. We are interested in finding the HEE of a bath (system-B) in contact with a central subsystem-A. We assume that the net size of systems A and B together remains fixed while allowing variation in individual sizes. This assumption is simply guided by the conservation laws. It is found that for large bath size the island entropy term are important. However other subleading (icebergs) terms do also contribute to bath entropy. The contributions are generally not separable from each other and all such contributions add together to give rise a fixed quantity. Further when accounted properly all such contributions will form part of higher entropy branch for the bath. Nevertheless the HEE of bath system should be subjected to minimality principle. The quantum minimality principle $ S_{quantum}[B]=\{S[A], S_{total}+S[A]\}_{min}$, is local in nature and gives rise to the Page curve. It is shown that the changes in bath entropy do capture Kaluza-Klein discreteness. The minimality principle would be applicable in finite temperature systems as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion is a dissipative transport phenomenon ubiquitously present in nature. Its details can now be analysed with modern effective field theory (EFT) techniques that use the closed-time-path (or Schwinger-Keldysh) formalism. We discuss the structure of the diffusive effective action appropriate for the analysis of stochastic or thermal loop effects, responsible for the so-called long-time tails, to all orders. We also elucidate and prove a number of properties of the EFT and use the theory to establish the analytic structure of the $n$-loop contributions to diffusive retarded two-point functions. Our analysis confirms a previously proposed result by Delacr\'{e}taz that used microscopic conformal field theory arguments. Then, we analyse a number of implications of these loop corrections to the dispersion relations of the diffusive mode and new, gapped modes that appear when the EFT is treated as exact. Finally, we discuss certain features of an all-loop model of diffusion that only retains a special subset of $n$-loop `banana' diagrams.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional hierarchy of recursive extensions for all sub$^n$-leading soft effects in Yang-Mills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our proposal in arXiv:2405.06629, we present in detail the construction of the extended phase space for Yang-Mills at null infinity, containing the asymptotic symmetries and the charges responsible for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems at all orders. The generality of the procedure allows it to be directly applied to the computation of both tree and loop-level soft limits. We also give a detailed study of Yang-Mills equations under the radial expansion, giving a thorough construction of the radiative phase space for decays compatible with tree-level amplitudes for both light-cone and radial gauges. This gives rise to useful recursion relations at all orders between the field strength and the vector gauge coefficients. We construct the sub$^n$-leading charges recursively, and show a hierarchical truncation such that each charge subalgebra is closed, and their action in the extended phase space is canonical. We relate these results with the infinite-dimensional algebras that have been recently introduced in the context of conformal field theories at null infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review we discuss currents in celestial CFT and the consistency of their naive symmetry algebras. In particular we study in detail the Jacobi identity and the double residue condition for soft insertions, hard momentum space insertions, and hard celestial insertions. In the latter case we introduce the notion of a "hard current" in CFT and work through examples in the 2D critical Ising model. The current algebra of hard insertions in pure Einstein gravity is a slight conceptual generalization of the familiar $w_{1+\infty}$-wedge current algebra. We also review branch cut terms in the celestial OPE, which indicate new primary content and were previously missed until recently. We work through an explicit toy example illustrating the mechanism by which such branch cut terms can arise. These branch cut terms prevent a symmetry interpretation but are fully compatible with a consistent OPE.</description>

      <title>3d Carrollian Chern-Simons theory and 2d Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the goal of building a concrete co-dimension one holographically dual field theory for four dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes (4d AFS) as a limit of AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$, we begin an investigation of 3d Chern-Simons matter (CSM) theories in the Carroll regime. We perform a Carroll (speed of light $c\to0$) expansion of the relativistic Chern-Simons action coupled to a massless scalar and obtain Carrollian CSM theories, which we show are invariant under the infinite dimensional 3d conformal Carroll or 4d Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS$_4$) symmetries, thus making them putative duals for 4d AFS. Concentrating on the leading-order electric Carroll CSM theory, we perform a null reduction of the 3d theory. Null reduction is a procedure to obtain non-relativistic theories from a higher dimensional relativistic theory. Curiously, null reduction of a Carrollian theory yields a relativistic lower-dimensional theory. We work with $SU(N) \times SU(M)$ CS theory coupled to bi-fundamental matter and show that when $N=M$, we obtain (rather surprisingly) a 2d Euclidean Yang-Mills theory after null reduction. We also comment on the reduction when $N \neq M$ and possible connections of the null-reduced Carroll theory to a candidate 2d Celestial CFT.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Partition Functions and the Flat Limit of AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of the S-matrix as a path integral with specified asymptotic boundary conditions naturally leads to the realization of a Carrollian partition function defined on the boundary of Minkowski space. This partition function, specified at past and future null infinity in the case of massless particles, generates Carrollian correlation functions that encode the S-matrix. We explore this connection, including the realization of symmetries, soft theorems arising from large gauge transformations, and the correspondence with standard momentum space amplitudes. This framework is also well-suited for embedding the Minkowski space S-matrix into the AdS/CFT duality in the large radius limit. In particular, we identify the AdS and Carrollian partition functions through a simple map between their respective asymptotic data, establishing a direct correspondence between the actions of symmetries on both sides. Our approach thus provides a coherent framework that ties together various topics extensively studied in recent and past literature.</description>

      <title>Dissecting polytopes: Landau singularities and asymptotic expansions in $2\to 2$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric representations of Feynman integrals have a key property: many, frequently all, of the Landau singularities appear as endpoint divergences. This leads to a geometric interpretation of the singularities as faces of Newton polytopes, which facilitates algorithmic evaluation by sector decomposition and asymptotic expansion by the method of regions. Here we identify cases where some singularities appear instead as pinches in parametric space for general kinematics, and we then extend the applicability of sector decomposition and the method of regions algorithms to such integrals, by dissecting the Newton polytope on the singular locus. We focus on $2\to 2$ massless scattering, where we show that pinches in parameter space occur starting from three loops in particular nonplanar graphs due to cancellation between terms of opposite sign in the second Symanzik polynomial. While the affected integrals cannot be evaluated by standard sector decomposition, we show how they can be computed by first linearising the graph polynomial and then splitting the integration domain at the singularity, so as to turn it into an endpoint divergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that obtaining the correct asymptotic expansion of such integrals by the method of regions requires the introduction of new regions, which can be systematically identified as facets of the dissected polytope. In certain instances, these hidden regions exclusively govern the leading power behaviour of the integral. In momentum space, we find that in the on-shell expansion for wide-angle scattering the new regions are characterised by having two or more connected hard subgraphs, while in the Regge limit they are characterised by Glauber modes.</description>

      <title>Far from Perfect: Quantum Error Correction with (Hyperinvariant) Evenbly Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of qubit codes that we call Evenbly codes, building on a previous proposal of hyperinvariant tensor networks. Its tensor network description consists of local, non-perfect tensors describing CSS codes interspersed with Hadamard gates, placed on a hyperbolic $\{p,q\}$ geometry with even $q\geq 4$, yielding an infinitely large class of subsystem codes. We construct an example for a $\{5,4\}$ manifold and describe strategies of logical gauge fixing that lead to different rates $k/n$ and distances $d$, which we calculate analytically, finding distances which range from $d=2$ to $d \sim n^{2/3}$ in the ungauged case. Investigating threshold performance under erasure, depolarizing, and pure Pauli noise channels, we find that the code exhibits a depolarizing noise threshold of about $19.1\%$ in the code-capacity model and $50\%$ for pure Pauli and erasure channels under suitable gauges. We also test a constant-rate version with $k/n = 0.125$, finding excellent error resilience (about $40\%$) under the erasure channel. Recovery rates for these and other settings are studied both under an optimal decoder as well as a more efficient but non-optimal greedy decoder. We also consider generalizations beyond the CSS tensor construction, compute error rates and thresholds for other hyperbolic geometries, and discuss the relationship to holographic bulk/boundary dualities. Our work indicates that Evenbly codes may show promise for practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>The legacy of boson clouds on black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons can leave an imprint on the gravitational waveform of black hole binaries through "ionization" and "resonances". We study the sequence of resonances as the binary evolves, and show that there are only two possible outcomes, each with a distinct imprint on the waveform. If the cloud and the binary are nearly counter-rotating, then the cloud survives in its original state until it enters the sensitivity band of future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. In all other cases, resonances destroy the cloud, while driving the binary to co-rotate with it and its eccentricity close to a fixed point. This opens up the possibility of inferring the existence of a new boson from the statistical analysis of a population of black holes binaries.</description>

Abstract: We propose an analytical approximation for the energy spectrum of the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by a broken power-law power spectrum, and find that both the asymptotic power-law tails and the intermediate peak contribute distinct features to the SIGW spectrum. Moreover, the broken power-law power spectrum has abundant near-peak features and our results can be used as a near-peak approximation that covers a wide range of models. Our analytical approximation is useful in the rapid generation of the SIGW energy spectrum, which is beneficial for gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>A Light QCD Axion with Hilltop Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a light QCD axion and identify the parameter space to obtain the correct relic dark matter abundance. The axion potential is flattened at the origin, corresponding to the only minimum, while it is unsuppressed at $\pi$. These potential features arise by assuming a mirror sector with the strong CP phase $\bar\theta$ shifted by $\pi$ compared to the SM sector, which allows the mirror axion potential to be tuned against the usual QCD axion potential. Before the QCD phase transition, assuming the mirror sector is decoupled and much colder than the SM thermal bath, the mirror sector potential dominates, causing the axion to initially roll to a temporary minimum at $\pi$. However, after the QCD phase transition, the potential minimum changes, and the axion relaxes from the newly created "hilltop" near $\pi$ to the CP-conserving minimum at the origin. As the axion adiabatically tracks this shift in the potential minimum through the QCD phase transition, with non-adiabatic evolution near $\pi$ and 0, it alters the usual prediction of the dark matter abundance. Consequently, this "hilltop" misalignment mechanism opens new regions of axion parameter space, with the correct relic abundance while still solving the strong CP problem, that could be explored in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study a general class of effective backgrounds that break diffeomorphism invariance and their potential roles in cosmology. Specifically, we examine both explicit and spontaneous background fields which display distinct transformation properties and are characterized with different dynamics. For explicit breaking, we focus on the $t$-sector of the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME) and for spontaneous breaking on a vector field called the bumblebee model. In both cases, we derive the modified Friedmann equations and find a configuration of the background fields that preserve isotropy and homogeneity. We show that the explicit $t$-sector admits phases of accelerated expansion of the universe with standard matter.</description>

Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for \(SU(N)\) Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims that first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, paving the way for IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

For the Kerr-Newman metric, this proves a recent numerical observation by Hristov. We propose a new method to compute the sum of the entropies using a generalized Smarr formula. The higher-curvature corrections in Gauss-Bonnet gravity are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological models of quantum gravity often consider the existence of some form of minimal length. This feature is commonly described in the context of quantum mechanics and using the corresponding formalism and techniques. Although few attempts at a quantum field-theoretical description of a minimal length has been proposed, they are rather the exception and there is no general agreement on the correct one. Here, using the quantum-mechanical model as a guidance, we propose a first-principle definition of a quantum field theory including a minimal length. Specifically, we propose a two-step procedure, by first describing the quantum-mechanical models as a classical field theory and subsequently quantizing it. We are thus able to provide a foundation for further exploration of the implications of a minimal length in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Modified Abelian and SU(2) Wilson theories on a lattice from a non-compact regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiflavour gauge theories of matter systems on a three-dimensional lattice have recently been widely investigated especially in connection with a possible symmetry enlargement at a continuous phase transition. Abelian models were studied both with compact gauge fields and in a mixed formulation in which the coupling with matter fields is in compact form while the gauge fields Lagrangian is written in terms of non-compact gauge fields, getting quite different results. Such a mixed formulation is not permissible for non-Abelian theories, for which however there exists an entirely non-compact formulation (in which exact gauge invariance is enforced by help of auxiliary fields), that for SU(2) was shown to yield in the scaling window a larger physical volume than Wilson's one. The corresponding U(1) non-compact regularization is derived in the present work. In both Abelian and SU(2) cases there is only one auxiliary field which for large mass has a linear coupling with the other fields and it can be integrated out. The coupling with the auxiliary field might make the inversion of the fermion matrix easier.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nonlinear dynamics of a rolling axion during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spectator axion-gauge sector, minimally coupled to the inflaton, with the axion experiencing a momentary stage of fast roll during cosmological inflation, can generate unique signatures in primordial density fluctuations and the gravitational wave background. We present the first lattice simulation of this system using a novel hybrid numerical scheme. This approach solves the fully nonlinear dynamics of the axion-gauge sector while treating the gravitational interaction between the axion and inflaton linearly. Initially, we test the validity of the WKB approximation in the linear regime. We then investigate strong backreaction dynamics within the axion-gauge sector. Our findings reveal that backreaction significantly suppresses the growth of the gauge field and the amplitude of scalar perturbations. The simulation also allows us to analyze the non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, including higher-order statistics. We show that, although non-Gaussianity is suppressed by strong backreaction, it remains higher than in the minimal model where the axion coincides with the inflaton. Our results highlight the need for simulations to make robust predictions to test against data from gravitational wave interferometers and large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Magnetic exponent for the long-range bond disordered Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical behavior of two-dimensional Potts models in presence of a bond disorder in which the correlation decays as a power law. In some recent work the thermal sector of this theory was investigated by a renormalization group computation based on perturbed conformal field theory. Here we apply the same approach to study instead the magnetic sector. In particular we compute the leading corrections to the Potts spin scaling dimension. Our results include as a special case the long-range disorder Ising model. We compare our prediction to Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, by studying the magnetization scaling function, we show a clear numerical evidence of a cross-over between the long-range and the short-range class of universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field coupled to the torsion in Teleparallel Gravity and we study the spontaneous scalarization of the Schwarzschild black hole. The scalarization is triggered by the torsion. The scalarized black hole solutions are asymptotically flat, and they are studied under their thermodynamics, and we show that they are meta-stable solutions without phase transitions of first and second order. Also, we demonstrate the existence of distinct branches classified by the number of nodes of the scalar field. For the branches analyzed, the Schwarzschild black hole solution has the lowest free energy and is always thermodinamically preferred over scalarized black holes. However, scalarized black holes are entropically favored compared to the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Spikes and spines in 4D Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as quantum Regge calculus and spin foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while the boundary edges are kept small. Spikes and spines are prime examples for such configurations. They pose a significant challenge for a desired continuum limit, for which the average lengths of edges ought to become very small. Here we investigate spike and spine configurations in four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum Regge calculus. We find that the expectation values of arbitrary powers of the bulk length are finite. To that end, we explore new types of asymptotic regimes for the Regge amplitudes, in which some of the edges are much larger than the remaining ones. The amplitudes simplify considerably in such asymptotic regimes and the geometric interpretation of the resulting expressions involves a dimensional reduction, which might have applications to holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body systems which saturate the quantum bound on chaos are attracting interest across a wide range of fields. Notable examples include the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variations, all characterised by some form or randomness and all to all couplings. Here we study many-body quantum chaos in a quantum impurity model showing Non-Fermi-Liquid physics, the overscreened multichannel $SU(N)$ Kondo model. We compute exactly the low-temperature behavior of the out-of time order correlator in the limit of large $N$ and large number of channels $K$, at fixed ratio $\gamma=K/N$. Due to strong correlations at the impurity site the spin fractionalizes in auxiliary fermions and bosons. We show that all the degrees of freedom of our theory acquire a Lyapunov exponent which is linear in temperature as $T\rightarrow 0$, with a prefactor that depends on $\gamma$. Remarkably, for $N=K$ the impurity spin displays maximal chaos, while bosons and fermions only get up to half of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Our results highlights two new features: a non-disordered model which is maximally chaotic due to strong correlations at its boundary and a fractionalization of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Unruh-DeWitt Quantum Computing: Realizing Quantum Shannon Theory With Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit-field quantum transduction provides numerous advantages to quantum computing, such as device-specific error-correcting codes, efficient scalability, and effective entanglement generation. An all-to-all connected bus of qubits implanted around the outside of a topological insulator, allowed to interact with the edge state, is a promising arena for transduction with flying fermionic qubits. Unruh--DeWitt detectors have allowed quantum information scientists to model entanglement properties of qubit-field interactions in many settings in a field known as Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). Unruh--DeWitt detectors are useful tools to realize quantum Shannon theory, a subset of the theory of quantum communication, in condensed matter systems, aptly named Unruh--DeWitt quantum computers. These systems will provide quantitative measurements of communication in quantum materials that utilize coherent states for bosonic and fermionic fields. In this thesis, emphasis is placed on the well-studied theory of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, as the bosonization of a helical Luttinger liquid provides a pedagogical arena to construct RQI channels of fermionic systems. Multiple experimentally realizable systems are proposed, and design constraints are constructed to ensure maximum channel capacity. Furthermore, we elucidate the strength of these quantum channels using measurements from quantum Shannon theory such as coherent information, dephasing formalism, diamond distance and universality of Unruh--DeWitt quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>Systematic input scheme for many-boson Hamiltonians via quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel, systematic input scheme for many-boson Hamiltonians in order to solve field theory problems within the light-front Hamiltonian formalism via quantum computing. We present our discussion of this input scheme based on the light-front Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional $\phi ^4$ theory. In our input scheme, we employ a set of quantum registers, where each register encodes the occupation of a distinct boson mode as binaries. We squeeze the boson operators of each mode and present the Hamiltonian in terms of unique combinations of the squeezed boson operators. We design the circuit modules for these unique combinations. Based on these circuit modules, we block encode the many-boson Hamiltonian utilizing the idea of quantum walk. We demonstrate our input scheme by solving the low-lying spectra of the Hamiltonian utilizing the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. We can incorporate the input scheme in this work with the input scheme for many-fermion Hamiltonians; they jointly offer new pathways to solving the structure and dynamics of field theory problems on future fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Multi-parametric and analytic families of four-dimensional $\,\textrm{AdS}_{3} \times \mathbb{R}\,$ (Janus) and $\,\textrm{AdS}_{3} \,\times\, \mathbb{R}^{+}$ (Hades) solutions are constructed in the SO(8) gauged supergravity that arises from the consistent reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on $\,\textrm{S}^7\,$. The solutions are generically non-supersymmetric, involve non-trivial running scalars and preserve a $\,\textrm{U}(1)^4\,$ symmetry. Different patterns of (super) symmetry enhancement occur upon suitable adjustment of the free parameters which further control the boundary conditions of the running scalars. We concentrate on the non-supersymmetric Janus and Hades solutions with $\,\textrm{SU}(3) \times \textrm{U}(1)^2\,$ symmetry and provide their higher-dimensional description in terms of M-theory fluxes and membranes. Special attention is paid to a class of such Hades solutions dubbed "ridge flows" which resemble dielectric rotations of Coulomb branch flows previously investigated in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The Checkerboard conformal field theory is an interesting representative of a large class of non-unitary, logarithmic Fishnet CFTs (FCFT) in arbitrary dimension which have been intensively studied in the last years. Its planar Feynman graphs have the structure of a regular square lattice with checkerboard colouring. Such graphs are integrable since each coloured cell of the lattice is equal to an R-matrix in the principal series representations of the conformal group. We compute perturbatively and numerically the anomalous dimension of the shortest single-trace operator in two reductions of the Checkerboard CFT: the first one corresponds to the Fishnet limit of the twisted ABJM theory in 3D, whereas the spectrum in the second, 2D reduction contains the energy of the BFKL Pomeron. We derive an analytic expression for the Checkerboard analogues of Basso--Dixon 4-point functions, as well as for the class of Diamond-type 4-point graphs with disc topology. The properties of the latter are studied in terms of OPE for operators with open indices. We prove that the spectrum of the theory receives corrections only at even orders in the loop expansion and we conjecture such a modification of Checkerboard CFT where quantum corrections occur only with a given periodicity in the loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-parametric families of non-supersymmetric EAdS$_{4}$ flows as well as asymptotically EAdS$_{4}$ solitons and wormholes are constructed within the four-dimensional $\textrm{SO}(8)$ gauged supergravity that describes the compactification of M-theory on $\textrm{S}^{7}$. More concretely, the solutions are found within the so-called STU-model that describes the $\textrm{U}(1)^4$ invariant sector of the theory. The on-shell action and gravitational free energy are computed for the regular solutions, the latter being zero for the wormholes irrespective of supersymmetry. There are special loci in parameter space yielding solutions with enhanced (super)symmetry. Examples include a supersymmetric EAdS$_{4}$ flow with $\textrm{SO}(4) \times \textrm{SO}(4)$ symmetry dual to a specific real mass deformation of ABJM on S$^{3}$ as well as a non-supersymmetric wormhole with $\textrm{SU}(3) \times \textrm{U}(1)^2$ symmetry. Uplift formulae for these and other examples to Euclidean solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity are presented and their complex nature discussed.</description>

Abstract: The Hofstadter model allows to describe and understand several phenomena in condensed matter such as the quantum Hall effect, Anderson localization, charge pumping, and flat-bands in quasiperiodic structures, and is a rare example of fractality in the quantum world. An apparently unrelated system, the relativistic Toda lattice, has been extensively studied in the context of complex nonlinear dynamics, and more recently for its connection to supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and topological string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-energy physics. Here we discuss a recently discovered spectral relationship between the Hofstadter model and the relativistic Toda lattice which has been later conjectured to be related to the Langlands duality of quantum groups. Moreover, by employing similarity transformations compatible with the quantum group structure, we establish a formula parametrizing the energy spectrum of the Hofstadter model in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials. The main tools used are the spectral duality of tridiagonal matrices and the representation theory of the elementary quantum group.</description>

Abstract: Cosmelkology is the study of Elko in cosmology. Elko is a massive spin-half field of mass dimension one. Elko differs from the Dirac and Majorana fermions because it furnishes the irreducible representation of the extended Poincare group with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy where the particle and anti-particle states both have four degrees of freedom. Elko has a renormalizable quartic self interaction which makes it a candidate for self-interacting dark matter. We study Elko in the spatially flat FLRW space-time and find exact solutions in the de Sitter space. By choosing the appropriate solutions and phases, the fields satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations and have the correct time evolutions in the flat space limit.</description>

Abstract: General exotic bi-gravity, obtained in Ozkan et al. (Phys Rev Lett 123(3):031303, 2019), is a unitary parity-preserving model which describes two interacting spin-two fields in three-dimensional spacetime. Adopting a symplectic viewpoint, we investigate the dynamical structure of general exotic bi-gravity theory. In particular, by exploiting the properties of the corresponding pre-symplectic matrix and its associated zero-modes, we explicitly derive all constraints of the theory, including the integrability conditions and scalar relationships between all the parameters and fields defining the model. Then, as an application, these scalar relationships are used for studying the anti-de Sitter background. After that, we derive the gauge transformations for the dynamical variables from the structure of the remaining zero-modes, meaning that such zero-modes are indeed the generators of the gauge symmetry of the theory. Finally, by switching off one of the four coupling constants $\beta_{n}$ and assuming the invertibility of some of the dreibeins, we find that the general exotic bi-gravity theory has two physical degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anti-de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is used to provide an estimate of the radius of convergence of the linearized gradient expansion of the hydrodynamic description of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory minimally coupled to $U(1)$ gauge theory subjected to strong magnetic fields. The results of this work demonstrate that the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes continue to converge for magnetic field strengths far beyond those values for which a hydrodynamic description is expected. For magnetic field strengths much larger then the temperature scale the bulk dual interpolates between AdS$_{4+1}$ and the product of a Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole and a two dimensional manifold (BTZ$_{2+1}\times \mathbb{R}^2$), and may be regarded as a renormalization group flow of the $3+1$ dimensional CFT to a $1+1$ dimensional CFT. In this regime, we clarify past literature on the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of bulk scalar fields by introducing a new way to classify the behavior of QNM collisions in the complex frequency and momentum plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-charge master field which generates all n-point correlation functions with an insertion of large charge Q in non-relativistic conformal field theory is obtained. This field is used to compute Schr\"odinger-invariant n-point correlation functions of large-charge operators via a direct evaluation of the path integral. Conformal dimensions are found to agree with calculations based on the state-operator correspondence. The master field solution exhibits an emergent harmonic trap whose frequency is a function of the Euclidean time. The large-charge effective action with operator insertions describes a droplet of superfluid matter whose spatial size scales with the time separation of sources. The solution is used to compute Schr\"odinger symmetry breaking corrections in the large-charge effective field theory (EFT) due to a finite scattering length in the fundamental theory of fermions near unitarity. The scaling of these effects in the large-charge power counting scheme is established, and the size of the effects is quantified using input from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the near-unitary gas, as well as from the large-N expansion at large charge.</description>

      <title>Twisted circle compactification of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and its Holographic Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a compactification of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, with $SU(N)$ gauge group, on a circle with anti-periodic boundary conditions for the fermions. We couple the theory to a constant background gauge field along the circle for an abelian subgroup of the $R$-symmetry which allows to preserve four supersymmetries. The 3D effective theory exhibits gapped and ungapped phases, which we argue are holographically dual, respectively, to a supersymmetric soliton in AdS$_{5}\times S^{5}$, and a particular quotient of AdS$_5\times S^5$. The gapped phase corresponds to an IR 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory at level $N$, while the ungapped phase is naturally identified with the root of a Higgs branch in the 3D theory. We discuss the extension of the twisting procedure to maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theories in different dimensions, obtaining the relevant duals for 2D and 6D, and comment on the odd dimensional cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review constructions of three-dimensional `quantum' black holes. Such spacetimes arise via holographic braneworlds and are exact solutions to an induced higher-derivative theory of gravity consistently coupled to a large$-c$ quantum field theory with an ultraviolet cutoff, accounting for all orders of semi-classical backreaction. Notably, such quantum-corrected black holes are much larger than the Planck length. We describe the geometry and horizon thermodynamics of a host of asymptotically (anti-) de Sitter and flat quantum black holes. A summary of higher-dimensional extensions is given. We survey multiple applications of quantum black holes and braneworld holography.</description>

      <title>Hunting 3d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SQED in the $\epsilon$-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently shown that $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models can be studied in the $\epsilon$-expansion by analytically continuing the number of fermionic degrees of freedom to be half-integer. In this work we study the extension of this strategy to gauge theories. We consider $U(1)$ gauge theories with $N_g$ neutral Majorana fermions $\chi_a$, $N_f$ charge-1 bosons $\phi_i$ and $N_f\times N_g$ charge-1 Dirac fermions $\psi_{ia}$ in the $d=4-2\epsilon$ expansion. Analytically continuing to $N_g=\frac12$ schematically matches the Lagrangian and matter content of $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SQED, and we check whether this match can be made rigorous. We compute anomalous dimensions of $\chi_a$ up to two loops and of meson operators up to one loop at the fixed points, and compare to expectations from SUSY. While we find obstructions to SUSY at small $N_f$, at large $N_f$ the observables approach the expected values at a SUSY fixed point. This may allow for checks of $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ IR dualities between gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density from the form factor bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The form-factor bootstrap is incomplete until one normalizes the zero-particle form factor. For the stress energy tensor we describe how to obtain the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} | 0 \rangle = \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, from the form-factor bootstrap. Even for integrable QFT's in D=2 spacetime dimensions, this prescription is new, although it reproduces previously known results obtained in a different and more difficult thermodynamic Bethe ansatz computation. We propose a version of this prescription in D=4 dimensions. For these even dimensions, the vacuum energy density has the universal form $\rho_{\rm vac} \propto m^D/\mathfrak{g}$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a dimensionless interaction coupling constant which can be determined from the high energy behavior of the S-matrix. In the limit $\mathfrak{g} \to 0$, $\rho_{\rm vac} $ diverges due to well understood UV divergences in free quantum field theories. If we assume the the observed Cosmological Constant originates from the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$ computed as proposed here, then this suggests there must exist a particle which does not obtain its mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electro-weak sector, which we designate as the "zeron". A strong candidate for the zeron is a massive Majorana neutrino.</description>

Abstract: We construct the universal AdS$_{4}$ black hole that asymptotes to the $(\varphi,\chi)$-family of type IIB S-fold backgrounds dual to the conformal manifold of $\mathcal{N}=2$ S-fold CFT's. We present the explicit type IIB embedding of such a universal black hole for two particular asymptotics: the $\,\mathcal{N}=2\,$ S-fold with $\,\textrm{U}(2)\,$ symmetry at $\,(\varphi,\chi)=(0,0)\,$ and the $\,\mathcal{N}=4\,$ S-fold with $\,\textrm{SO}(4)\,$ symmetry at $\,(\varphi,\chi)=(1,0)$. As a byproduct, we also present a novel $1/16$-BPS two-parameter family of $\,\textrm{AdS}_{2} \times \textrm{M}_{8}\,$ S-fold backgrounds with $\,\textrm{M}_{8}=\mathbb{H}^{2} \times \textrm{S}^{5} \times \textrm{S}^{1}$ that features a parametrically-controlled scale separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling constants of fixed points in the $\epsilon$ expansion at one loop are known to satisfy a quadratic bound due to Rychkov and Stergiou. We refer to fixed points that saturate this bound as extremal fixed points. The theories which contain such fixed points are those which undergo a saddle-node bifurcation, entailing the presence of a marginal operator. Among bifundamental theories, a few examples of infinite families of such theories are known. A necessary condition for extremality is that the sizes of the factors of the symmetry group of a given theory satisfy a specific Diophantine equation, given in terms of what we call the extremality polynomial. In this work we study such Diophantine equations and employ a combination of rigorous and probabilistic estimates to argue that these infinite families constitute rare exceptions. The Pell equation, Falting's theorem, Siegel's theorem, and elliptic curves figure prominently in our analysis. In the cases we study here, more generic classes of multi-fundamental theories saturate the Rychkov-Stergiou bound only in sporadic cases or in limits where they degenerate into simpler known examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.11399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a moment map picture for holomorphic string algebroids where the Hamiltonian gauge action is described by means of inner automorphisms of Courant algebroids. The zero locus of our moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the moduli space of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the moduli space carries a pseudo-K\"ahler metric with K\"ahler potential given by the dilaton functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries of supersymmetric oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the dynamical symmetries of classical supersymmetric oscillators, in one and two spatial (bosonic) dimensions. Our main ingredient is a generalized Poisson bracket, which is defined as a suitable classical counterpart to commutators and anticommutators. In one dimension, i.e., in the presence of one bosonic and one fermionic coordinate, the Hamiltonian admits a $U(1,1)$ symmetry, for which we explicitly compute the first integrals. It is found that suitable forms of the supercharges emerge in a natural way as fermionic conserved quantities. Following this, we describe classical supercharge operators based on the generalized Poisson bracket, and subsequently define supersymmetry transformations. We perform a straightforward generalization to two spatial dimensions, where the Hamiltonian has an overall $U(2,2)$ symmetry. We comment on plausible supersymmetric generalizations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck and isotonic oscillators, and also present the possibility of defining a generalized Nambu bracket within the classical formalism.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman-modified-gravity black hole's impact on the magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the magnetic reconnection process of energy extraction from a rapidly rotating Kerr-Newman-modified-gravity (MOG) black hole by investigating the combined effect of black hole charge and the MOG parameter. We explore the energy efficiency of energy extraction and power by applying the new energy extraction mechanism proposed by Comisso and Asenjo. Based on an attractive gravitational charge of the MOG parameter $\alpha$ that physically manifests to strengthen black hole gravity, we show that the combined effect of the MOG parameter and black hole charge can play an increasingly important role and accordingly lead to high energy efficiency and power for the energy extraction via the magnetic reconnection. Further, we study to estimate the rate of energy extraction under the fast magnetic reconnection by comparing the power of the magnetic reconnection and Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanisms. We show that the rate of energy extraction increases as a consequence of the combined effect of black hole charge and MOG parameter. It suggests that magnetic reconnection is significantly more efficient than the BZ mechanism. In fact, the magnetic reconnection is fueled by magnetic field energy due to the twisting of magnetic field lines around the black hole for the plasma acceleration, and thus the MOG parameter gives rise to even more fast spin that can strongly change the magnetic field reconfiguration due to the frame dragging effect. This is how energy extraction is strongly enhanced through the magnetic reconnection, thus making the energy extraction surprisingly more efficient for the Kerr-Newman-MOG black hole than the Kerr black hole under the combined effect of black hole charge and MOG parameter.</description>

      <title>Integrability from categorification and the 2-Kac-Moody Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bialgebras plays a major role in the study of one dimensional integrable systems; many families of integrable systems can be recovered from a Lax pair which is constructed from a Lie bialgebra associated to a Poisson-Lie group. A higher homotopy notion of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bialgebras has been studied using Lie algebra crossed-modules and $L_2$-algebras, which gave rise to the notion of (strict) Lie 2-bialgebras and Poisson-Lie 2-groups . In this paper, we use these structures to generalize the construction of a Lax pairs and introduce an appropriate notion of {higher homotopy integrability}. Within this framework, we introduce a higher homotopy version of the Kac-Moody algebra, with which the 2-Lax equation can be rewritten as a zero 2-curvature condition in 2+1d. An explicit characterization of our higher Kac-Moody algebra will be given, and we also demonstrate how it governs the 2-Lax pairs and the symmetries of a 3d topological-holomorphic field theory studied recently. This 3d theory thus serves as an example of a physical system that exhibits the sort of 2-graded integrability that we have defined here.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies of Diffusive Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays in $f(R)$ Gravity Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the anisotropy of ultra high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is crucial for unraveling the origins and propagation mechanisms of these enigmatic particles. In this work, we studied the dipolar anisotropy of UHECRs in the diffusive regime by considering three cosmological models: the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, $f(R)$ gravity power-law model and the Starobinsky model. This work aims to see the role of the $f(R)$ gravity theory in understanding the anisotropy of UHECRs without condoning the standard cosmology. We found that the amplitude of the dipolar anisotropy is sensitive to these cosmological models, with the $f(R)$ power-law model predicting the largest amplitude, while the $\Lambda$CDM model predicting the smallest amplitude at most of the energies in the range considered. The predicted amplitude of the Starobinsky model lies within the range of the $\Lambda$CDM one. This work not only provides a way for exploration of UHECRs anisotropy within different cosmological contexts but also may pave the way for new avenues of research at the intersection of high-energy astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: Unstable particles decay sooner or later, so they are not described by asymptotic one-particle states and they should not be included as independent states in unitarity relations such as the optical theorem. The same applies to any countable collection of unstable particles. We show that the behaviour of unparticle stuff, that is, a continuous collection of particles with different masses and common decay channels, is pretty different: it has a non-vanishing probability of surviving for ever and the corresponding asymptotic states must be taken into account to comply with unitarity. We also discuss compressed spectra and the transition from the discrete to the continuous case.</description>

Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

Abstract: We analyze how the presence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) characterizing a time machine can be discerned by placing a local particle detector in a region of spacetime which is causally disconnected from the CTCs. Our study shows that not only can the detector tell if there are CTCs, but also that the detector can separate topological from geometrical information and distinguish periodic spacetimes without CTCs (like the Einstein cylinder), curvature, and spacetimes with topological identifications that enable time-machines.</description>

Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>

Abstract: This Letter aims to advance unexplored properties of a new class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity, reported in Universe 9, 467 (2023) and Eur.$\,$Phys.$\,$J.$\,$C 83, 626 (2023). Therein, it was shown that when the Weak Energy Condition is violated, the topology of spacetime in scalar-tensor gravity is altered, enabling the formation of two-way traversable wormholes. Furthermore, each of these wormholes acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>

Abstract: Generalized uncertainty principles are effective changes to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that emerge in several quantum gravity models. In the present letter, we study the consequences that two classes of these modifications yield on the physics of neutrinos. Besides analyzing the change in the oscillation probabilities that the generalized uncertainty principles entail, we assess their impact on the neutrino coherence length and their possible interpretation as nonstandard neutrino interactions. Constraints cast by present and planned neutrino experiments on the generalized uncertainty principles parameters are also derived.</description>

      <title>Revisiting quantum field theory in Rindler spacetime with superselection rules</title>

Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) in Rindler spacetime is a gateway to understanding unitarity and information loss paradoxes in curved spacetime. Rindler coordinates map Minkowski spacetime onto regions with horizons, effectively dividing accelerated observers into causally disconnected sectors. Employing standard quantum field theory techniques and Bogoliubov transformations between Minkowski and Rindler coordinates yields entanglement between states across these causally separated regions of spacetime. This results in a breakdown of unitarity, implying that information regarding the entangled partner may be irretrievably lost beyond the Rindler horizon. As a consequence, one has a situation of pure states evolving into mixed states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for comprehending this phenomenon using a recently proposed formulation of direct-sum quantum field theory (DQFT), which is grounded in superselection rules formulated by the parity and time reversal ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. In the context of DQFT applied to Rindler spacetime, we demonstrate that each Rindler observer can, in principle, access pure states within the horizon, thereby restoring unitarity. However, our analysis also reveals the emergence of a thermal spectrum of Unruh radiation. This prompts a reevaluation of entanglement in Rindler spacetime, where we propose a novel perspective on how Rindler observers may reconstruct complementary information beyond the horizon. Furthermore, we revisit the implications of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem within the framework of DQFT. Lastly, we underscore how our findings contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at elucidating the role of unitarity in quantum field theory within the context of de Sitter and black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole and its shadow in scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) theory has attracted significant interest due to its ability to effectively address the issue of galaxy rotation curves and clusters of galaxies without considering the influence of dark matter. In this paper, we construct rotating black hole solutions with a cosmological constant in the STVG theory (i.e., Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole solutions), where the import of a gravitational charge as a source modifies the gravitational constant, determined by $ G=G_{\text{N}}(1+\alpha) $. For Kerr-MOG-dS spacetime, the observer is situated at a specific location within the domain of outer communication, rather than being located infinitely far away. Since black hole shadows are shaped by light propagation in spacetime, the interaction between the MOG parameter and the cosmological constant is expected to produce novel effects on these shadows. As the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ increases, the apparent size of the black hole shadow decreases. Additionally, the shadow expands with an increase in the MOG parameter $\alpha$, reaching a maximum at a certain value, and its shape becomes more rounded under an arbitrary rotation parameter, which leads to degeneracy between different black hole parameters. However, by employing numerical ray-tracing techniques, we have found that gravitational lensing and the frame-dragging effect effectively distinguish this degeneracy. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of black holes in modified gravity, their observational signatures, and constraints.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>

Abstract: Over the past thirty years there has been an ever-increasing interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven in large part by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with splitting the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is simple and unambiguous for massive particles, there are many different proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been explicitly shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, like photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We show that the obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-$\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>
