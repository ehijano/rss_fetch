      <title>In Search of Excellence: SHOA as a Competitive Shrike Optimization Algorithm for Multimodal Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is proposed as the Shrike Optimization Algorithm (SHOA). Many creatures living in a group and surviving for the next generation randomly search for food; they follow the best one in the swarm, called swarm intelligence. Swarm-based algorithms are designed to mimic creatures' behaviours, but in multimodal problem competition, they cannot find optimal solutions in some difficult cases. The main inspiration for the proposed algorithm is taken from the swarming behaviours of shrike birds in nature. The shrike birds are migrating from their territory to survive. However, the SHOA mimics the surviving behaviour of shrike birds for living, adaptation, and breeding. Two parts of optimization exploration and exploitation are designed by modelling shrike breeding and searching for foods to feed nestlings until they get ready to fly and live independently. This paper is a mathematical model for the SHOA to perform optimization. The SHOA benchmarked 19 well-known mathematical test functions, 10 from CEC-2019, and 12 from CEC-2022 most recent test functions, a total of 41 competitive mathematical test functions benchmarked and four real-world engineering problems with different conditions, both constrained and unconstrained. The statistical results obtained from the Wilcoxon sum ranking and Fridman test show that SHOA has a significant statistical superiority in handling the test benchmarks compared to competitor algorithms in multi-modal problems. The results for engineering optimization problems show the SHOA outperforms other nature-inspired algorithms in many cases.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Heterogeneity in Timescales for Sparse Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks for Energy-Efficient Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the forefront of neuromorphic computing, promising energy-efficient and biologically plausible models for complex tasks. This paper weaves together three groundbreaking studies that revolutionize SNN performance through the introduction of heterogeneity in neuron and synapse dynamics. We explore the transformative impact of Heterogeneous Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (HRSNNs), supported by rigorous analytical frameworks and novel pruning methods like Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP). Our findings reveal how heterogeneity not only enhances classification performance but also reduces spiking activity, leading to more efficient and robust networks. By bridging theoretical insights with practical applications, this comprehensive summary highlights the potential of SNNs to outperform traditional neural networks while maintaining lower computational costs. Join us on a journey through the cutting-edge advancements that pave the way for the future of intelligent, energy-efficient neural computing.</description>

      <title>A Two-stage Evolutionary Framework For Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of evolutionary multi-objective optimization, the approximation of the Pareto front (PF) is achieved by utilizing a collection of representative candidate solutions that exhibit desirable convergence and diversity. Although several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been designed, they still have difficulties in keeping balance between convergence and diversity of population. To better solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), this paper proposes a Two-stage Evolutionary Framework For Multi-objective Optimization (TEMOF). Literally, algorithms are divided into two stages to enhance the search capability of the population. During the initial half of evolutions, parental selection is exclusively conducted from the primary population. Additionally, we not only perform environmental selection on the current population, but we also establish an external archive to store individuals situated on the first PF. Subsequently, in the second stage, parents are randomly chosen either from the population or the archive. In the experiments, one classic MOEA and two state-of-the-art MOEAs are integrated into the framework to form three new algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the superior and robust performance of the proposed framework across a wide range of MOPs. Besides, the winner among three new algorithms is compared with several existing MOEAs and shows better results. Meanwhile, we conclude the reasons that why the two-stage framework is effect for the existing benchmark functions.</description>

      <title>Generalizing and Unifying Gray-box Combinatorial Optimization Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gray-box optimization leverages the information available about the mathematical structure of an optimization problem to design efficient search operators. Efficient hill climbers and crossover operators have been proposed in the domain of pseudo-Boolean optimization and also in some permutation problems. However, there is no general rule on how to design these efficient operators in different representation domains. This paper proposes a general framework that encompasses all known gray-box operators for combinatorial optimization problems. The framework is general enough to shed light on the design of new efficient operators for new problems and representation domains. We also unify the proofs of efficiency for gray-box hill climbers and crossovers and show that the mathematical property explaining the speed-up of gray-box crossover operators, also explains the efficient identification of improving moves in gray-box hill climbers. We illustrate the power of the new framework by proposing an efficient hill climber and crossover for two related permutation problems: the Linear Ordering Problem and the Single Machine Total Weighted Tardiness Problem.</description>

      <title>An Attempt to Devise a Pairwise Ising-Type Maximum Entropy Model Integrated Cost Function for Optimizing SNN Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment process of a spiking neural network (SNN) can involve partitioning a neural network and mapping partitions onto processing units within the neuromorphic hardware. Searching for optimal deployment schemes presents an NP-hard problem. Optimization of deployment schemes encounters challenges in devising computationally effective cost functions for optimization objectives such as communication time consumption and energy efficiency. These kinds of objectives necessitate consideration of network dynamics shaped by neuron activity patterns, demanding intricate mathematical analyses or simulations for integrating them into a cost model for the deployment of an SNN. The network dynamics are hardware-independent and can be modeled separately from specific hardware configurations. Our approach employs a pairwise Ising-type maximum entropy model, which has shown its effectiveness in accurately reproducing pairwise correlations among components in a system. We utilized this model to capture network dynamics, upon which a cost function is built incorporating hardware-specific parameters. We conducted an extremely preliminary investigation using the SpiNNaker machine. We show that the existing model training can also be computationally complex. Currently, we still lack sufficient evidence to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Further efforts is needed to explore integrating network dynamics into SNN deployment.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Spatial Information for Self-Supervised Place Cell Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammals navigate novel environments and exhibit resilience to sparse environmental sensory cues via place and grid cells, which encode position in space. While the efficiency of grid cell coding has been extensively studied, the computational role of place cells is less well understood. This gap arises partially because spatial information measures have, until now, been limited to single place cells. We derive and implement a higher-order spatial information measure, allowing for the study of the emergence of multiple place cells in a self-supervised manner. We show that emergent place cells have many desirable features, including high-accuracy spatial decoding. This is the first work in which higher-order spatial information measures that depend solely on place cells' firing rates have been derived and which focuses on the emergence of multiple place cells via self-supervised learning. By quantifying the spatial information of multiple place cells, we enhance our understanding of place cell formation and capabilities in recurrent neural networks, thereby improving the potential navigation capabilities of artificial systems in novel environments without objective location information.</description>

      <title>B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span ("context" in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory "in-context," permanent structural memory "in-weights," fading memory "in-state," and long-term eidetic memory "in-storage" by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.</description>

      <title>A third-order finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme with shallow neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06333v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme based on the neural network for hyperbolic conservation laws. We employ the supervised learning and design two loss functions, one with the mean squared error and the other with the mean squared logarithmic error, where the WENO3-JS weights are computed as the labels. Each loss function consists of two components where the first component compares the difference between the weights from the neural network and WENO3-JS weights, while the second component matches the output weights of the neural network and the linear weights. The former of the loss function enforces the neural network to follow the WENO properties, implying that there is no need for the post-processing layer. Additionally the latter leads to better performance around discontinuities. As a neural network structure, we choose the shallow neural network (SNN) for computational efficiency with the Delta layer consisting of the normalized undivided differences. These constructed WENO3-SNN schemes show the outperformed results in one-dimensional examples and improved behavior in two-dimensional examples, compared with the simulations from WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z.</description>

      <title>Frequency and Generalisation of Periodic Activation Functions in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic activation functions, often referred to as learned Fourier features have been widely demonstrated to improve sample efficiency and stability in a variety of deep RL algorithms. Potentially incompatible hypotheses have been made about the source of these improvements. One is that periodic activations learn low frequency representations and as a result avoid overfitting to bootstrapped targets. Another is that periodic activations learn high frequency representations that are more expressive, allowing networks to quickly fit complex value functions. We analyse these claims empirically, finding that periodic representations consistently converge to high frequencies regardless of their initialisation frequency. We also find that while periodic activation functions improve sample efficiency, they exhibit worse generalization on states with added observation noise -- especially when compared to otherwise equivalent networks with ReLU activation functions. Finally, we show that weight decay regularization is able to partially offset the overfitting of periodic activation functions, delivering value functions that learn quickly while also generalizing.</description>

      <title>A Concept-Value Network as a Brain Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.04579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper suggests a statistical framework for describing the relations between the physical and conceptual entities of a brain-like model. Features and concept instances are put into context, where the paper suggests that features may be the electrical wiring, although chemical connections are also possible. With this idea, the actual length of the connection is important, because it is related to firing rates and neuron synchronization, but the signal type is less important. The paper then suggests that concepts are neuron groups that link feature sets and concept instances are determined by chemical signals from those groups. Therefore, features become the static horizontal framework of the neural system and concepts are vertically interconnected combinations of these. With regards to functionality, the neuron is then considered to be functional and the more horizontal memory structures can be glial. This would also suggest that features can be distributed entities and not concentrated to a single area.</description>

      <title>Expanding continual few-shot learning benchmarks to include recognition of specific instances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07863v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning and few-shot learning are important frontiers in progress toward broader Machine Learning (ML) capabilities. Recently, there has been intense interest in combining both. One of the first examples to do so was the Continual few-shot Learning (CFSL) framework of Antoniou et al. arXiv:2004.11967. In this study, we extend CFSL in two ways that capture a broader range of challenges, important for intelligent agent behaviour in real-world conditions. First, we increased the number of classes by an order of magnitude, making the results more comparable to standard continual learning experiments. Second, we introduced an 'instance test' which requires recognition of specific instances of classes -- a capability of animal cognition that is usually neglected in ML. For an initial exploration of ML model performance under these conditions, we selected representative baseline models from the original CFSL work and added a model variant with replay. As expected, learning more classes is more difficult than the original CFSL experiments, and interestingly, the way in which image instances and classes are presented affects classification performance. Surprisingly, accuracy in the baseline instance test is comparable to other classification tasks, but poor given significant occlusion and noise. The use of replay for consolidation substantially improves performance for both types of tasks, but particularly for the instance test.</description>

Abstract: Genetic Algorithms have established their capability for solving many complex optimization problems. Even as good solutions are produced, the user's understanding of a problem is not necessarily improved, which can lead to a lack of confidence in the results. To mitigate this issue, explainability aims to give insight to the user by presenting them with the knowledge obtained by the algorithm. In this paper we introduce Partial Solutions in order to improve the explainability of solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Partial Solutions represent beneficial traits found by analyzing a population, and are presented to the user for explainability, but also provide an explicit model from which new solutions can be generated. We present an algorithm that assembles a collection of Partial Solutions chosen to strike a balance between high fitness, simplicity and atomicity. Experiments with standard benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm is able to find Partial Solutions which improve explainability at reasonable computational cost without affecting search performance.</description>

      <title>Prospective Messaging: Learning in Networks with Communication Delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inter-neuron communication delays are ubiquitous in physically realized neural networks such as biological neural circuits and neuromorphic hardware. These delays have significant and often disruptive consequences on network dynamics during training and inference. It is therefore essential that communication delays be accounted for, both in computational models of biological neural networks and in large-scale neuromorphic systems. Nonetheless, communication delays have yet to be comprehensively addressed in either domain. In this paper, we first show that delays prevent state-of-the-art continuous-time neural networks called Latent Equilibrium (LE) networks from learning even simple tasks despite significant overparameterization. We then propose to compensate for communication delays by predicting future signals based on currently available ones. This conceptually straightforward approach, which we call prospective messaging (PM), uses only neuron-local information, and is flexible in terms of memory and computation requirements. We demonstrate that incorporating PM into delayed LE networks prevents reaction lags, and facilitates successful learning on Fourier synthesis and autoregressive video prediction tasks.</description>
