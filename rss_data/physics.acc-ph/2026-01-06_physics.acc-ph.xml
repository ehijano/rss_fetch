      <title>Effect of Synchrotron Radiation on Staged Plasma Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a staged, beam-driven, plasma wakefield accelerator, electrons are accelerated in a sequence of plasma stages, each powered by a driver electron bunch. Between each stage, a magnetic chicane is used to dispose of the spent driver and to inject the new fresh one, while transporting the witness bunch. We discuss the effect of synchrotron radiation in the interstage section on the accelerating gradient and on the final energy reach of such a machine.</description>

      <title>High-Pressure Reinforced Vessel, produced by Additive Manufacturing, to be used as a gas target for the measurement program at n_TOF -- Multiple Argon Experiments (MArEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The n_TOF collaboration has expressed interest in developing transmission experiments with liquid argon (LAr) and gaseous argon (GAr) to improve the understanding of neutron propagation and capture in Ar. This topic is relevant to both nuclear and particle physics, as LAr is widely used in neutrino experiments, dark matter searches and other applications. Despite its widespread use, neutron interactions on Ar are still poorly characterized. In this context, the Multiple Argon Experiments (MArEX) initiative aims to address these gaps by providing detailed measurements of neutron and Ar interactions, including resolved resonance parameters and radiative capture widths, across an unprecedented energy range from 1 eV to 200 MeV. As part of MArEX research activities, this paper presents the development of an innovative High-Pressure Reinforced Vessel (HPRV) for GAr targets, produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) and reinforced with carbon fibre (CF). The experimental results confirmed the capability of the vessel to withstand high operating pressure without any issues and the capability of the Multi-layers Finite Element Model (MLs-FEM) to simulate and predict the stress behaviour and the operation limit of the vessel.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the space-charge dilemma in low-energy heavy ion beams via a multistage acceleration lens system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01367v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy heavy-ion beams are fundamentally limited by severe space-charge divergence, which constrains the transportable beam current to a few microamperes in conventional electrostatic accelerators. This limitation is particularly critical for high-mass ions, where the generalized perveance increases rapidly because of their low velocity. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent space-charge limit can be overcome by shaping the electrostatic potential configuration of an existing multistage accelerator, thereby transforming the acceleration column itself into a combined acceleration-focusing column. By optimizing the interstage voltage configuration, a strong electrostatic lens effect is superimposed on the accelerating field to counteract space-charge-driven expansion. We formulate a generalized design framework that quantitatively maps the transport 'design window' in terms of beam current, ion mass, and acceleration voltage. For gold ions at 64 keV, this approach enables stable transport of beam currents exceeding 100 microA, more than an order of magnitude higher than the conventional limit. Numerical phase-space analysis shows that this improvement is achieved by prioritizing envelope control over emittance preservation, a trade-off intrinsic to space-charge-dominated regimes. Our results establish a universal and practical guideline for high-current heavy-ion beam transport, relevant to fusion plasma diagnostics, ion implantation, and massive molecular ion applications.</description>
