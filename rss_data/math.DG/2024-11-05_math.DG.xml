      <title>The dual Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00779v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem for torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu \cite{HJ00} also studied this problem by the method of curvature flows and obtained the existence of smooth even solutions. In addition, the smooth non-even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem $w. r. t$ $q$-torsional rigidity were given by Zhao et al. \cite{ZX} through a Gauss curvature flow.
  The dual curvature measure and the dual Minkowski problem were first posed and considered by Huang, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang in \cite{HY}. The dual Minkowski problem is a very important problem, which has greatly contributed to the development of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory and extended the other types dual Minkowski problem.
  To the best of our knowledge, the dual Minkowski problem $w. r. t$ ($q$) torsional rigidity is still open because the dual ($q$) torsional measure is blank. Thus, it is a natural problem to consider the dual Minkowski problem for ($q$) torsional rigidity. In this paper, we introduce the $p$-th dual $q$-torsional measure by the variational method and propose the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$. Then we confirm the existence of smooth even solutions for $p&lt;n$ ($p\neq 0$) to the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity by method of a Gauss curvature flow. Specially, we also obtain the smooth non-even solutions with $p&lt;0$ to this problem.</description>

      <title>On gauge theory and parallel transport in principal 2-bundles over Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an interplay between some ideas in traditional gauge theory and certain concepts in fibered categories. We accomplish this by introducing a notion of a principal Lie 2-group bundle over a Lie groupoid and studying its connection structures, gauge transformations, and parallel transport.
  We obtain a Lie 2-group torsor version of the one-one correspondence between fibered categories and pseudofunctors. This results in a classification of our principal 2-bundles based on their underlying fibration structures. This allows us to extend a class of our principal 2-bundles to be defined over differentiable stacks presented by the base Lie groupoids. We construct a short exact sequence of VB-groupoids, namely, the 'Atiyah sequence' associated to our principal 2-bundles. Splitting and splitting up to a natural isomorphism of our Atiyah sequence, respectively, gives us notions of 'strict connections' and 'semi-strict connections' on our principal 2-bundles. We describe such connections in terms of Lie 2-algebra valued 1-forms on the total Lie groupoids. The underlying fibration structure of our 2-bundle provides an existence criterion for strict and semi-strict connections. We study the action of the 2-group of gauge transformations on the groupoid of strict and semi-strict connections, and interestingly, we observe an extended symmetry of semi-strict connections. We demonstrate an interrelationship between `differential geometric connection-induced horizontal path lifting property in traditional principal bundles' and the `category theoretic cartesian lifting of morphisms in fibered categories' by developing a theory of connection-induced parallel transport along a particular class of Haefliger paths in the base Lie groupoid of our principle 2-bundles. Finally, we employ our results to introduce a notion of parallel transport along Haefliger paths in the setup of VB-groupoids.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces with prescribed gradient image. Let $\Omega$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ be uniformly convex bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary.

      <title>A rigidity result for axisymmetric toric Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a non-axisymmetric perturbation of a family of axisymmetric toric Einstein manifolds and Ricci solitons studied in Firester-Tsiamis (2024). We establish a rigidity result stating that these axisymmetric Ricci solitons do not admit constant-angle non-axisymmetric perturbations except for conformally flat cases. For these new cases, our result leads to an explicit description of the Einstein metrics and a classification of the Ricci solitons under a volume-collapsing ansatz.</description>

      <title>Chern flat manifolds that are torsion-critical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced a special type of Hermitian metrics called {\em torsion-critical,} which are non-K\"ahler critical points of the $L^2$-norm of Chern torsion over the space of all Hermitian metrics with unit volume on a compact complex manifold. In this short note, we restrict our attention to the class of compact Chern flat manifolds, which are compact quotients of complex Lie groups equipped with compatible left-invariant metrics. Our main result states that, if a Chern flat metric is torsion-critical, then the complex Lie group must be semi-simple, and conversely, any semi-simple complex Lie group admits a compatible left-invariant metric that is torsion-critical.</description>

      <title>Distance from a Finsler Submanifold to its Cut Locus and the Existence of a Tubular Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that for a closed, not necessarily compact, submanifold $N$ of a possibly non-complete Finsler manifold $(M, F)$, the cut time map is always positive. As a consequence, we prove the existence of a tubular neighborhood of such a submanifold. When $N$ is compact, it then follows that there exists an $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that the distance between $N$ and its cut locus $\mathrm{Cu}(N)$ is at least $\epsilon$. This was originally proved by B. Alves and M. A. Javaloyes (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2019). We have given an alternative, rather geometric proof of the same, which is novel even in the Riemannian setup. We also obtain easier proofs of some results from N. Innami et al. (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2019), under weaker hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Examples of Toric Scalar-flat K\"ahler Surfaces with Mixed-type Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a strictly unbounded toric symplectic 4-manifold, we explicitly construct complete toric scalar-flat K\"ahler metrics on the complement of a toric divisor. These symplectic 4-manifolds correspond to a specific class of non-compact K\"ahler surfaces. We also provide an alternative construction of toric scalar-flat K\"ahler metrics with conical singularity along the toric divisor, following the approach of Abreu and Sena-Dias.</description>

      <title>Real Left-Symmetric Algebras with Positive Definite Koszul Form and K\"ahler-Einstein Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathfrak{g}, \bullet)$ be a real left symmetric algebra, and $(\mathfrak{g}^-, [\;,\;])$ the corresponding Lie algebra. We denote by $L$ the left multiplication operator associated with the product $\bullet$. The symmetric bilinear form $\mathrm{B}(X, Y) = \mathrm{tr}(L_{X \bullet Y})$, referred to as the Koszul form of $(\mathfrak{g}, \bullet)$, is introduced. We provide a complete characterization, along with a broad class of examples, of real left symmetric algebras that possess a positive definite Koszul form. In particular, we show that for a left symmetric algebra with positive definite Koszul form being commutative or associative or Novikov implies that this algebra is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with its canonical product.
  Beyond their algebraic interest, we show that any real left symmetric algebra $(\mathfrak{g}, \bullet)$ with a positive definite Koszul form induces a K\"ahler-Einstein structure with negative scalar curvature on the tangent bundle $TG$ of any connected Lie group $G$ associated to $(\mathfrak{g}^-, [\;,\;])$. Furthermore, the characterization of left symmetric algebras with a positive definite Koszul form leads to a new class of non-associative algebras, which are of independent interest and generalize Hessian Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Higher Willmore Energies from tractor coupled GJMS operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and construct a conformally invariant energy for closed smoothly immersed submanifolds of even dimension, but of arbitrary codimension, in conformally flat Riemannian manifolds. This is a higher dimensional analogue of the Willmore energy for immersed surfaces and is given directly via a coupling of the tractor connection to the (submanifold critical) GJMS operators. In the case where the submanifold is of dimension 4 we compare this to other energies, including one found using a second simple construction that uses $Q$-operators.</description>

      <title>Conformal structures with $G_2$-symmetric twistor distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any 4D split-signature conformal structure, there is an induced twistor distribution on the 5D space of all self-dual totally null 2-planes, which is $(2,3,5)$ when the conformal structure is not anti-self-dual. Several examples where the twistor distribution achieves maximal symmetry (the split-real form of the exceptional simple Lie algebra of type $\mathrm{G}_2$) were previously known, and these include fascinating examples arising from the rolling of surfaces without twisting or slipping. Relaxing the rolling assumption, we establish a complete local classification result among those homogeneous 4D split-conformal structures for which the symmetry algebra induces a multiply-transitive action on the 5D space. Furthermore, we discuss geometric properties of these conformal structures such as their curvature, holonomy, and existence of Einstein representatives.</description>

      <title>Rod Structures and Patching Matrices: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the twistor theory construction of stationary and axisymmetric, Lorentzian signature solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations and the related toric Ricci-flat metrics of Riemannian signature, \cite{W,MW,F,FW}. The construction arises from the Ward construction \cite{W2} of anti-self-dual Yang-Mills fields as holomorphic vector bundles on twistor space, with the observation of Witten \cite{LW} that the Einstein equations for these metrics include the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The principal datum for a solution is the holomorphic patching matrix $P$ for a holomorphic vector bundle on a reduced twistor space, and $P$ is typically simpler than the corresponding metric to write down.
  I give a catalogue of examples, building on earlier collections \cite{F,AG}, and consider the inverse problem: how far does the rod structure of such a metric, together with its asymptotics, determine $P$?</description>

      <title>The Penrose inequality in extrinsic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemannian Penrose inequality is a fundamental result in mathematical relativity. It has been a long-standing conjecture of G. Huisken that an analogous result should hold in the context of extrinsic geometry. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture and show that the exterior mass $m$ of an asymptotically flat support surface $S\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ with nonnegative mean curvature and outermost free boundary minimal surface $D$ is bounded in terms of $$ m\geq \sqrt{\frac{|D|}{\pi}}. $$ If equality holds, then the unbounded component of $S\setminus \partial D$ is a half-catenoid. In particular, this extrinsic Penrose inequality leads to a new characterization of the catenoid among all complete embedded minimal surfaces with finite total curvature. To prove this result, we study minimal capillary surfaces supported on $S$ that minimize the free energy and discover a quantity associated with these surfaces that is nondecreasing as the contact angle increases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the geometry of complete constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces immersed in an (n + 1)-dimensional Riemannian manifold N (n = 2, 3 and 4) with sectional curvatures uniformly bounded from below. We generalise radius estimates given by Rosenberg [32] (n = 2) and by Elbert, Nelli and Rosenberg [13] and Cheng [2] (n = 3, 4) to nearly stable CMC hypersurfaces immersed in N. We also prove that certain CMC hypersurfaces effectively embedded in N must be proper.</description>

      <title>Extremal domains in $\mathbb{S}^2$: Geometric and Analytic methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{S}^2$ that support positive solutions to the overdetermined problem $ \Delta{u} + f(u, |\nabla u|) = 0 $ in $\Omega$, with the boundary conditions $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$ and $|\nabla u|$ being locally constant along $\partial \Omega$. We refer to such domains as $f$-extremal domains and focus on those with disconnected boundaries.
  In the first part of the paper, we extend the moving plane method on $\mathbb{S}^2$ to demonstrate that if $\Omega$ is an $f$-extremal domain containing a simple closed curve of maximum points of $u$, then $\Omega$ must be either rotationally symmetric or antipodally symmetric. We also establish a similar result for constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces with capillary boundaries.
  In the second part, we strengthen the previous result for certain nonlinearities $f=f(u)$, proving that the domain $\Omega$ must, in fact, be rotationally symmetric. This is achieved by generalizing the analytic methods used in our earlier work [20].
  We focus on the case where $\Omega$, $u$, and $f$ are analytic to avoid technicalities that could hinder the exposition of the main ideas of this article. However, the required regularity assumptions can be significantly relaxed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of relative stability conditions on triangulated categories with respect to left admissible subcategories, based on arXiv:math/0212237, and demonstrate the deformation of relative stability conditions via the deformation of gluing stability conditions in arXiv:0902.0323. The motivation for this concept stems from the discussions in arXiv:2004.04831 concerning the relationship between Bridgeland stability and the existence of the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics on line bundles.</description>

We consider the moduli space of hyperbolic structures on S with geodesic boundary, such that the hyperbolic structure near each marked point is a cusp, equipped with a horocycle. This space carries a volume form. Let us fix the set K of distances between the horocycles at the adjacent cusps, and the set L of lengths of boundary circles without cusps. We get a subspace M(S; K,L) with the induced volume form Vol(K,L). However, if the cusps are present, the volume of the space M(S; K,L) is infinite.
  We introduce the exponential volume form exp(-W)Vol(K,L), where W is a positive function on the moduli space, given by the sum over cusps of the hyperbolic areas enclosed between the cusp and the horocycle at the cusp. We prove that the exponential volume, defined as the integral of the exponential volume form over the moduli space M(S; K,L), is always finite.
  We suggest that the moduli spaces M(S; K,L) with the exponential volume forms are the true analogs of the classical moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, with the Weil-Petersson volume forms. In particular, they should be relevant to the open string theory.
  We support this by proving an unfolding formula for the integrals of measurable functions multiplied by the exponential volume form. It expresses them as finite sums of similar integrals over moduli spaces for simpler surfaces. They generalise Mirzakhani's recursions for the volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$-floating area, curvature entropy, and isoperimetric inequalities on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore analogs of classical centro-affine invariant isoperimetric inequalities, such as the Blaschke--Santal\'o inequality and the $L_p$-affine isoperimetric inequalities, for convex bodies in spherical space. Specifically, we establish an isoperimetric inequality for the floating area and prove a stability result based on the spherical volume difference.
  The floating area has previously been studied as a natural extension of classical affine surface area to non-Euclidean convex bodies in spaces of constant curvature. In this work, we introduce the $L_p$-floating areas for spherical convex bodies, extending Lutwak's centro-affine invariant family of $L_p$-affine surface area measures from Euclidean geometry. We prove a duality formula, monotonicity properties, and isoperimetric inequalities associated with this new family of curvature measures for spherical convex bodies.
  Additionally, we propose a novel curvature entropy functional for spherical convex bodies, based on the $L_p$-floating area, and establish a corresponding dual isoperimetric inequality.
  Finally, we extend our spherical notions to space forms with non-negative constant curvature in two distinct ways. One extension asymptotically connects with centro-affine geometry on convex bodies as curvature approaches zero, while the other converges with Euclidean geometry. Notably, our newly introduced curvature entropy for spherical convex bodies emerges as a natural counterpart to both the centro-affine entropy and the Gaussian entropy of convex bodies in Euclidean space.</description>

Abstract: We interpret the coarse symbol and index class of a Callias type Dirac operator $D+\Psi$ on a manifold $M$ as a pairing between the coarse symbol and index classes associated to $D$ and K-theory classes of the coarse corona of $M$ or $M$ itself determined by $\Psi$. Local positivity of $D$ and local invertibility of $\Psi$ are incorporated in terms of support conditions on the $K$-theoretic level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a version of Calder\'on's problem for harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. By using the higher linearization method, we first show that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map determines the metric on the domain up to a natural gauge in three cases: on surfaces, on analytic manifolds, and in conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds on a fixed conformal class with injective ray transform on the transversal manifold. Next, using higher linearizations we obtain integral identities that allows us to show that the metrics on the target have the same jets at one point. In particular, if the target is analytic, the metrics are equal. We also prove an energy rigidity result, in the sense that the Dirichlet energies of harmonic maps determines the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>The Long Time Limit of Diffusion Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistics on manifolds, the notion of the mean of a probability distribution becomes more involved than in a linear space. Several location statistics have been proposed, which reduce to the ordinary mean in Euclidean space. A relatively new family of contenders in this field are Diffusion Means, which are a one parameter family of location statistics modeled as initial points of isotropic diffusion with the diffusion time as parameter. It is natural to consider limit cases of the diffusion time parameter and it turns out that for short times the diffusion mean set approaches the intrinsic mean set. For long diffusion times, the limit is less obvious but for spheres of arbitrary dimension the diffusion mean set has been shown to converge to the extrinsic mean set. Here, we extend this result to the real projective spaces in their unique smooth isometric embedding into a linear space. We conjecture that the long time limit is always given by the extrinsic mean in the isometric embedding for connected compact symmetric spaces with unique isometric embedding.</description>

      <title>A non-trivial family of trivial bundles with complex hyperbolic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $\mathrm{PU}(2,1)$, the group of holomorphic isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane, we study the space of involutions $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5$ satisfying $R_5R_4R_3R_2R_1=1$, where $R_1$ is a reflection in a complex geodesic and the other $R_i$'s are reflections in points of the complex hyperbolic plane. We show that this space modulo $\mathrm{PU}(2,1)$-conjugation is bending-connected and has dimension $4$. Using this, we construct a $4$-dimensional bending-connected family of complex hyperbolic structures on a disc orbibundle with vanishing Euler number over the sphere with $5$ cone points of angle $\pi$. Bending-connectedness here means that we can naturally deform the geometric structure, like Dehn twists in Teichm\"uller theory. Additionally, finding complex hyperbolic disc orbibundles with vanishing Euler number is a hard problem, originally conjectured by W. Goldman and Y. Eliashberg and solved by S. Anan'in and N. Gusevskii, and we produce a simpler and more straightforward construction for them.</description>

Abstract: We repeat, using methods developed for BKM systems, the famous results of S. Novikov (1974), J. Moser (1981, 1982) , and A. Veselov (1980) that relate Schr\"odinger-Hill operators with finite-band spectra, solutions of the Neumann system, and certain solutions of the KdV equations. Our general motivation is to determine whether it is possible to apply inverse scattering methods to BKM systems, and in the conclusion, we indicate initial observations in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate an extension of the Calabi conjecture to the setting of generalized K\"ahler geometry. We show a transgression formula for the Bismut Ricci curvature in this setting, which requires a new local Goto/Kodaira-Spencer deformation result, and use it to show that solutions of the generalized Calabi-Yau equation on compact manifolds are classically K\"ahler, Calabi-Yau, and furthermore unique in their generalized K\"ahler class. We show that the generalized K\"ahler-Ricci flow is naturally adapted to this conjecture, and exhibit a number of a priori estimates and monotonicity formulas which suggest global existence and convergence. For initial data in the generalized K\"ahler class of a K\"ahler Calabi-Yau structure we prove the flow exists globally and converges to this unique fixed point. This has applications to understanding the space of generalized K\"ahler structures, and as a special case yields the topological structure of natural classes of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms on hyperK\"ahler manifolds. In the case of commuting-type generalized K\"ahler structures we establish global existence and convergence with arbitrary initial data to a K\"ahler, Calabi-Yau metric, which yields a new $d d^c$-lemma for these structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mapping properties of a large class of elliptic operators $P_T$ in gluing problems where two non-compact manifolds with asymptotically cylindrical geometry are glued along a neck of length $2T$. In the limit where $T \rightarrow \infty$, we reduce the question of constructing approximate solutions of $P_T u = f$ to a finite-dimensional linear system, and provide a geometric interpretation of the obstructions to solving this system. Under some assumptions on the real roots of the model operator $P_0$ on the cylinder, we construct a Fredholm inverse for $P_T$ with good control on the growth of its norm. As applications of our method, we study the decay rate and density of the low eigenvalues of the Laplacian acting on differential forms, and give improved estimates for compact $G_2$-manifolds constructed by twisted connected sum. We relate our results to the swampland distance conjectures in physics.</description>

Abstract: The first main result of this paper classifies contact 3-manifolds admitting critical metrics, i.e. adapted metrics which are the critical points (of the Dirichlet energy functional. This gives a complete answer to a question raised by Chern-Hamilton in 1984. Secondly, we show that in the case of Anosov contact metrics, the optimization of such energy functional is closely related to Reeb dynamics and can be described in terms of its entropy. We also study the consequences in the curvature realization problem for such contact metrics.</description>

Abstract: Bamler--Kleiner recently proved a multiplicity-one theorem for mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and combined it with the authors' work on generic mean curvature flows to fully resolve Huisken's genericity conjecture. In this paper we show that a short density-drop theorem plus the Bamler--Kleiner multiplicity-one theorem for tangent flows at the first nongeneric singular time suffice to resolve Huisken's conjecture -- without relying on the strict genus drop theorem for one-sided ancient flows previously established by the authors.</description>

Abstract: Schneider introduced an inter-dimensional difference body operator on convex bodies and proved an associated inequality. In the prequel to this work, we showed that this concept can be extended to a rich class of operators from convex geometry and proved the associated isoperimetric inequalities. The role of cosine-like operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$ from those in $\mathbb R^n$, were replaced by inter-dimensional simplicial operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^{nm}$ from those in $\mathbb R^{n}$ (or vice versa). In this work, we treat the $L^p$ extensions of these operators, and, furthermore, extend the role of the simplex to arbitrary $m$-dimensional convex bodies containing the origin. We establish $m$th-order $L^p$ isoperimetric inequalities, including the $m$th-order versions of the $L^p$ Petty projection inequality, $L^p$ Busemann-Petty centroid inequality, $L^p$ Santal\'o inequalities, and $L^p$ affine Sobolev inequalities. As an application, we obtain isoperimetric inequalities for the volume of the operator norm of linear functionals $(\mathbb R^n, \|\cdot\|_E) \to (\mathbb R^m, \|\cdot\|_F)$.</description>

Abstract: The exceptional compact hermitian symmetric space EIII is the quotient $E_6/Spin(10)\times_{\mathbb{Z}_4}U(1)$. We introduce the Pl\"ucker coordinates which give an embedding of EIII into $\mathbb{C}P^{26}$ as a projective subvariety. The subvariety is cut out by 27 Pl\"ucker relations. We show that, using Clifford algebra, one can solve this over-determined system of relations, giving local coordinate charts to the space.
  Our motivation is to understand EIII as the complex projective octonion plane $(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O})P^2$, whose construction is somewhat scattered across the literature. We will see that the EIII has an atlas whose transition functions have clear octonion interpretations, apart from those covering a sub-variety $X_{\infty}$ of dimension 10. This subvariety is itself a hermitian symmetric space known as DIII, with no apparent octonion interpretation. We give detailed analysis of the geometry in the neighbourhood of $X_{\infty}$.
  We further decompose $X={\rm EIII}$ into $F_4$-orbits: $X=Y_0\cup Y_{\infty}$, where $Y_0\sim(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ is an open $F_4$-orbit and is the complexification of $\mathbb{O}P^2$, whereas $Y_{\infty}$ has co-dimension 1, thus EIII could be more appropriately denoted as $\overline{(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}}$. This decomposition appears in the classification of equivariant completion of homogeneous algebraic varieties by Ahiezer \cite{Ahiezer}.</description>

      <title>A Note On Projective Structures On Compact Surfaces</title>

Abstract: Projective structures on topological surfaces support the structure of 2d CFTs with a degree of technical simplification. We propose a complex analytic space $\mathcal{P}_g$ biholomorphic to $T^*_{(1,0)} \mathcal{M}_g$ as a candidate moduli space of the projective structures of the genus $g$ topological surface. Explicit analysis at $g=1$, including of the fibers over the fictitious orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$ and of transformations under the modular group, supports this proposal. It also shows that $\mathcal{P}_{g=1}$ naturally resolves the orbifold locus of the affine structure moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{g=1}$ which is related to the Hodge bundle over $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$. For $g \geq 2$, intricate quotient operations are expected along fibers over the orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_g$, whose analysis we leave to future work.
  Physically, the space $\mathcal{P}_g$ represents the bundle of universal, stationary, chiral hydrodynamic flows spatially confined to compact genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</description>
