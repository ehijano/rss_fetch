      <title>A Completely Blind Channel Estimation Technique for OFDM Using Generalized Constellation Splitting and Modified Phase-Directed Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of blind channel estimation for SISO-OFDM systems using second-order statistics (SOS) is addressed. A comparison of two prominent SOS-based techniques: subspace-decomposition and precoding-induced correlation-averaging techniques in terms of MSE performance is presented. The drawback of these methods is that they suffer from a complex-scalar estimation ambiguity which is resolved by using pilots or reference symbols. By using pilots the whole purpose of blind techniques is contradicted. We propose an algorithm to resolve this ambiguity in blind manner using generalized constellation-splitting and modified phase-directed algorithm. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via numerical simulations in MATLAB environment.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Direct Geolocation of GNSS Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) interference, which has proven to be problematic in GNSS-dependent civilian applications. Many currently deployed GNSS receivers lack the proper countermeasures to defend themselves against interference, prompting the need for alternative defenses. Satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) provide an opportunity for GNSS interference detection, classification, and localization. The direct geolocation approach has been shown to be well-suited for low SNR regimes and in cases limited to short captures -- exactly what is expected for receivers in LEO. Direct geolocation is a single-step search over a geographical grid that enables estimation of the transmitter location directly from correlating raw observed signals. However, a key limitation to this approach is the computational requirements. This computational burden is compounded for LEO-based receivers as the geographic search space is extensive. This paper alleviates the computational burden of direct geolocation by exploiting the independence of position-domain correlation across candidate points and time steps: nearly all computation can be accomplished in parallel on a graphics processing unit (GPU). This paper presents and evaluates the performance of GPU-accelerated direct geolocation compared to traditional CPU processing.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Authentication Based on Hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder for Industrial Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) has attracted much attention since it takes advantage of the channel randomness nature of transmission media to achieve communication confidentiality and authentication. In the complex environment, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), machine learning (ML) is widely employed with PLA to extract and analyze complex channel characteristics for identity authentication. However, most PLA schemes for IIoT require attackers' prior channel information, leading to severe performance degradation when the source of the received signals is unknown in the training stage. Thus, a channel impulse response (CIR)-based PLA scheme named "Hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE)" for IIoT is proposed in this article, aiming at achieving high authentication performance without knowing attackers' prior channel information even when trained on a few data in the complex environment. HVAE consists of an Auto-Encoder (AE) module for CIR characteristics extraction and a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) module for improving the representation ability of the CIR characteristic and outputting the authentication results. Besides, a new objective function is constructed in which both the single-peak and the double-peak Gaussian distribution are taken into consideration in the VAE module. Moreover, the simulations are conducted under the static and mobile IIoT scenario, which verify the superiority of the proposed HVAE over three comparison PLA schemes even with a few training data.</description>

      <title>Deep Domain-Adversarial Adaptation for Automatic Modulation Classification under Channel Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a significant role in modern cognitive and intelligent radio systems, where accurate identification of modulation is crucial for adaptive communication. The presence of heterogeneous wireless channel conditions, such as Rayleigh and Rician fading, poses significant challenges to the generalization ability of conventional AMC models. In this work, a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) based deep learning framework is proposed that explicitly mitigates channel-induced distribution shifts between source and target domains. The approach is evaluated using a comprehensive simulated dataset containing five modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM) across Rayleigh and Rician fading channels at five frequency bands. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the DANN-based model achieves up to 14.93% absolute accuracy improvement in certain modulation cases compared to a baseline supervised model trained solely on the source domain. The findings establish the engineering feasibility of domain adversarial learning in AMC tasks under real-world channel variability and offer a robust direction for future research in adaptive spectrum intelligence</description>

      <title>Secure Transmission for Cell-Free Symbiotic Radio Communications with Movable Antenna: Continuous and Discrete Positioning Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided cell-free symbiotic radio (SR) system. Specifically, the MAs deployed at distributed access points (APs) work collaboratively with the RIS to establish high-quality propagation links for both primary and secondary transmissions, as well as suppressing the risk of eavesdropping on confidential primary information. We consider both continuous and discrete MA position cases and maximize the secrecy rate of primary transmission under the secondary transmission constraints, respectively. For the continuous position case, we propose a two-layer iterative optimization method based on differential evolution with one-in-one representation (DEO), to find a high-quality solution with relatively moderate computational complexity. For the discrete position case, we first extend the DEO based iterative framework by introducing the mapping and determination operations to handle the characteristic of discrete MA positions. To further reduce the computational complexity, we then design an alternating optimization (AO) iterative framework to solve all variables within a single layer. In particular, we develop an efficient strategy to derive the sub-optimal solution for the discrete MA positions, superseding the DEO-based method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MA empowered secure transmission scheme along with its optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large-Scale Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for 6G Near-Field Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G networks will need to support higher data rates, high-precision localization, and imaging capabilities. Near-field technologies, enabled by extremely large-scale (XL)-arrays, are expected to be essential physical-layer solutions to meet these ambitious requirements. However, implementing XL-array systems using traditional fully-digital or hybrid analog/digital architectures poses significant challenges due to high power consumption and implementation costs. Emerging XL-dynamic metasurface antennas (XL-DMAs) provide a promising alternative, enabling ultra-low power and cost-efficient solutions, making them ideal candidates for 6G near-field networks. In this article, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of XL-DMAs employed in 6G near-field networks. We first outline the fundamental principles of XL-DMAs and present the specifics of the near-field model of XL-DMAs. We then highlight several promising applications that might benefit from XL-DMAs, including near-field communication, localization, and imaging. Finally, we discuss several open problems and potential future directions that should be addressed to fully exploit the capabilities of XL-DMAs in the next 6G near-field networks.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Position Sensing Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Positioning Error Bound and Phase Shift Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) positioning has emerged as a promising technology for next-generation intelligent systems. The advent of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has revolutionized high-precision mmWave localization by enabling dynamic manipulation of wireless propagation environments. This paper investigates a three-dimensional (3D) multi-input single-output (MISO) mmWave positioning system assisted by multiple RISs. We introduce a measurement framework incorporating sequential RIS activation and directional beamforming to fully exploit virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) paths. The theoretical performance limits are rigorously analyzed through derivation of the Fisher information and subsequent positioning error bound (PEB). To minimize the PEB, two distinct optimization approaches are proposed for continuous and discrete phase shift configurations of RISs. For continuous phase shifts, a Riemannian manifold-based optimization algorithm is proposed. For discrete phase shifts, a heuristic algorithm incorporating the grey wolf optimizer is proposed. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing the PEB and validate the improvement in positioning accuracy achieved by multiple RISs.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)-assisted Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio (SR) framework empowered by the pinching antenna system (PASS), aiming to enhance both primary and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. PASS consists of multiple waveguides equipped with numerous low-cost pinching antennas (PAs), whose positions can be flexibly adjusted to simultaneously manipulate large-scale path loss and signal phases.We formulate a joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum rate while satisfying the detection error probability constraint for the IR and the feasible deployment region constraints for the PAs. This problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address it, two solution strategies are developed. 1) A learning-aided gradient descent (LGD) algorithm is proposed, where the constrained problem is reformulated into a differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning based on the principle of gradient descent. The PA position matrix is reparameterized to inherently satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. 2) A two-stage optimization-based approach is designed, in which the transmit beamforming is first optimized via successive convex approximation (SCA), followed by pinching beamforming optimization using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) search over candidate PA placements. The SCA-PSO algorithm achieves performance close to that of the element-wise method while significantly reducing computational complexity by exploring a randomly generated effective solution subspace, while further improving upon the LGD method by avoiding undesirable local optima.</description>

      <title>Robust Super-Resolution Compressive Sensing: A Two-timescale Alternating MAP Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of super-resolution compressive sensing (SR-CS) is crucial for various wireless sensing and communication applications. Existing methods often suffer from limited resolution capabilities and sensitivity to hyper-parameters, hindering their ability to accurately recover sparse signals when the grid parameters do not lie precisely on a fixed grid and are close to each other. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel robust super-resolution compressive sensing algorithmic framework using a two-timescale alternating maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. At the slow timescale, the proposed framework iterates between a sparse signal estimation module and a grid update module. In the sparse signal estimation module, a hyperbolic-tangent prior distribution based variational Bayesian inference (tanh-VBI) algorithm with a strong sparsity promotion capability is adopted to estimate the posterior probability of the sparse vector and accurately identify active grid components carrying primary energy under a dense grid. Subsequently, the grid update module utilizes the BFGS algorithm to refine these low-dimensional active grid components at a faster timescale to achieve super-resolution estimation of the grid parameters with a low computational cost. The proposed scheme is applied to the channel extrapolation problem, and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna System Design with LoS Blockage: Does In-Waveguide Attenuation Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature of pinching-antenna systems, in-waveguide attenuation is often neglected to simplify system design and enable more tractable analysis. However, its effect on overall system performance has received limited attention in the existing literature. While a recent study has shown that, in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated environments, the data rate loss incurred by omitting in-waveguide attenuation is negligible when the communication area is not excessively large, its effect under more general conditions remains unclear. This work extends the analysis to more realistic scenarios involving arbitrary levels of LoS blockage. We begin by examining a single-user case and derive an explicit expression for the average data rate loss caused by neglecting in-waveguide attenuation. The results demonstrate that, even for large service areas, the rate loss remains negligible under typical LoS blockage conditions. We then consider a more general multi-user scenario, where multiple pinching antennas, each deployed on a separate waveguide, jointly serve multiple users. The objective is to maximize the average sum rate by jointly optimize antenna positions and transmit beamformers to maximize the average sum rate under probabilistic LoS blockage. To solve the resulting stochastic and nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a dynamic sample average approximation (SAA) algorithm. At each iteration, this method replaces the expected objective with an empirical average computed from dynamically regenerated random channel realizations, ensuring that the optimization accurately reflects the current antenna configuration. Extensive simulation results are provided to the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the substantial performance gains of pinching-antenna systems, particularly in environments with significant LoS blockage.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Equalization of Zak-OTFS in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4G/5G wireless standards use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which is robust to frequency selectivity. Equalization is possible with a single tap filter, and low-complexity equalization makes OFDM an attractive physical layer. However the performance of OFDM degrades with mobility, since Doppler spreads introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) between subcarriers and they are no longer orthogonal. Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to doubly selective channels. Zak-OTFS signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to time domain (TD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. The received signal is a superposition of many attenuated copies since the doubly selective channel introduces delay and Doppler shifts. The received symbols are more difficult to equalize since they are subject to interference along both delay and Doppler axes. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity method of equalizing Zak-OTFS in the frequency domain (FD). We derive the FD system model and show that it is unitarily equivalent to the DD system model. We show that the channel matrix in the FD is banded, making it possible to apply conjugate gradient methods to reduce the complexity of equalization. We show that complexity of FD equalization is linear in the dimension of a Zak-OTFS frame. For comparison the complexity of naive MMSE equalization is cubic in the frame dimension. Through numerical simulations we show that FD equalization of Zak-OTFS achieves similar performance as equalization in DD domain.</description>

      <title>Vector Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing Over Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we extend orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) to vector OCDM (VOCDM) to provide more design freedom to deal with doubly selective channels. The VOCDM modulation is implemented by performing M parallel N-size inverse discrete Fresnel transforms (IDFnT). Based on the complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) for doubly selective channels, we derive the VOCDM input-output relationship, and show performance tradeoffs of VOCDM with respect to (w.r.t.) its modulation parameters M and N. Specifically, we investigate the diversity and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of VOCDM w.r.t. M and N. Under doubly selective channels, VOCDM exhibits superior diversity performance as long as the parameters M and N are configured to satisfy some constraints from the delay and the Doppler spreads of the channel, respectively. Furthermore, the PAPR of VOCDM signals decreases with a decreasing N. These theoretical findings are verified through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new technique for computer modeling linear filters based on the spectral form of mathematical description of linear systems. It assumes that input and output signals of the filter are represented as orthogonal expansions, while filters themselves are described by two-dimensional non-stationary transfer functions. This technique allows one to model the output signal in continuous time, and it is successfully tested on the Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, and Chebyshev filters with different orders.</description>

      <title>Multi-RIS Deployment Optimization for mmWave ISAC Systems in Real-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted integrated sensing and communication (RIS-ISAC) presents a promising system architecture to leverage the wide bandwidth available at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, while mitigating severe signal propagation losses and reducing infrastructure costs. To enhance ISAC functionalities in the future air-ground integrated network applications, RIS deployment must be carefully designed and evaluated, which forms the core motivation of this paper. To ensure practical relevance, a multi-RIS-ISAC system is established, with its signal model at mmWave frequencies demonstrated using ray-launching calibrated to real-world environments. On this basis, an energy-efficiency-driven optimization problem is formulated to minimize the multi-RIS size-to-coverage sum ratio, comprehensively considering real-world RIS deployment constraints, positions, orientations, as well as ISAC beamforming strategies at both the base station and the RISs. To solve the resulting non-convex mixed-integer problem, a simplified reformulation based on equivalent gain scaling method is introduced. A two-step iterative algorithm is then proposed, in which the deployment parameters are determined under fixed RIS positions in the first step, and the RIS position set is updated in the second step to progressively approach the optimum solution.

      <title>A Scalable Machine Learning Approach Enabled RIS Optimization with Implicit Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered as a key enabler of the next-generation mobile radio systems. While attracting extensive interest from academia and industry due to its passive nature and low cost, scalability of RIS elements and requirement for channel state information (CSI) are two major difficulties for the RIS to become a reality. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning (ML) enabled optimization approach to configure the RIS. The dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet is combined with an implicit channel estimation method. The RISnet learns to map from received pilot signals to RIS configuration directly without explicit channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines significantly.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting in Smart Radio Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the use of static electromagnetic skins (EMSs) to enable robust device localization via channel charting (CC) in realistic urban environments. We develop a rigorous optimization framework that leverages EMS to enhance channel dissimilarity and spatial fingerprinting, formulating EMS phase profile design as a codebook-based problem targeting the upper quantiles of key embedding metric, localization error, trustworthiness, and continuity. Through 3D ray-traced simulations of a representative city scenario, we demonstrate that optimized EMS configurations, in addition to significant improvement of the average positioning error, reduce the 90th-percentile localization error from over 60 m (no EMS) to less than 25 m, while drastically improving trustworthiness and continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit Smart Radio Environment (SRE) with static EMS for enhancing CC, achieving substantial gains in localization performance under challenging None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.</description>

      <title>Detection and Classification of Internal Leakage in Hydraulic Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydraulic systems have been one of the most used technologies in many industries due to their reliance on incompressible fluids that facilitate energy and power transfer. Within such systems, hydraulic cylinders are prime devices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Some of the genuine and very common problems related to hydraulic cylinders are leakages. Leakage in hydraulic systems can cause a drop in pressure, general inefficiency, and even complete failure of such systems. The various ways leakage can occur define the major categorization of leakage: internal and external leakage. External leakage is easily noticeable, while internal leakage, which involves fluid movement between pressure chambers, can be harder to detect and may gradually impact system performance without obvious signs. When leakage surpasses acceptable limits, it is classified as a fault or failure. In such cases, leakage is divided into three categories: no leakage, low leakage, and high leakage. It suggests a fault detection algorithm with the basic responsibility of detecting minimum leakage within the Hydraulic system, and minimizing detection time is the core idea of this paper. In order to fully develop this idea, experimental data collection of Hydraulic systems is required. The collected data uses pressure sensors and other signals that are single-related. Due to the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, more complex data analysis was enabled, which the LSTM-based leakage detection algorithm successfully achieved, providing almost 96% accuracy in classifying leakage types. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform real-time and online fault diagnosis for each cycle, reducing maintenance costs and prolonging the hydraulic system's lifespan.</description>

      <title>Direction of Arrival Estimation with Virtual Antenna Array Using FMCW Radar Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FMCW radars are widely used for automotive radar systems. The basic idea for FMCW radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The difference frequency, (i.e., beat frequency) between the transmitted and received signal is determined after down conversion. The FFT operation on beat frequency signal can recognize targets at different range and velocity. Increasing demand on safety functionality leads to the Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation to resolve two closely located targets. Consequently, the problem of angle estimation for 77GHz FMCW automotive radar simulated data has been investigated in this term project. In particular, we examined the performances of FFT, MUSIC and compressed sensing in angle estimation task, and it was found that although FFT is the fastest algorithm, it has very poor angular resolution when compared with others which are both super resolution algorithms. The code for this project report is available at https://github.com/ekurtgl/FMCW-MIMO-Radar-Simulation.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): A Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Remote ID Based UAV Collision Avoidance Optimization for Low-Altitude Airspace Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is paramount to ensure safe and efficient operations in open airspaces. The remote identification (Remote ID) is deemed an effective real-time UAV monitoring system by the federal aviation administration, which holds potentials for enabling inter-UAV communications. This paper deeply investigates the application of Remote ID for UAV collision avoidance while minimizing communication delays. First, we propose a Remote ID based distributed multi-UAV collision avoidance (DMUCA) framework to support the collision detection, avoidance decision-making, and trajectory recovery. Next, the average transmission delays for Remote ID messages are analyzed, incorporating the packet reception mechanisms and packet loss due to interference. The optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term average communication delay, where UAVs can flexibly select the Remote ID protocol to enhance the collision avoidance performance. To tackle the problem, we design a multi-agent deep Q-network based adaptive communication configuration algorithm, allowing UAVs to autonomously learn the optimal protocol configurations in dynamic environments. Finally, numerical results verify the feasibility of the proposed DMUCA framework, and the proposed mechanism can reduce the average delay by 32% compared to the fixed protocol configuration.</description>

      <title>Importance-Aware Semantic Communication in MIMO-OFDM Systems Using Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel importance-aware quantization, subcarrier mapping, and power allocation (IA-QSMPA) framework for semantic communication in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, empowered by a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). The proposed framework exploits attention-based importance extracted from a pretrained ViT to jointly optimize quantization levels, subcarrier mapping, and power allocation. Specifically, IA-QSMPA maps semantically important features to high-quality subchannels and allocates resources in accordance with their contribution to task performance and communication latency. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, a block coordinate descent algorithm is employed. The framework is further extended to operate under finite blocklength transmission, where communication errors may occur. In this setting, a segment-wise linear approximation of the channel dispersion penalty is introduced to enable efficient joint optimization under practical constraints. Simulation results on a multi-view image classification task using the MVP-N dataset demonstrate that IA-QSMPA significantly outperforms conventional methods in both ideal and finite blocklength transmission scenarios, achieving superior task performance and communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>Touch-Augmented Gaussian Splatting for Enhanced 3D Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that integrates touch signals (contact points and surface normals) into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach enhances scene reconstruction, particularly under challenging conditions like low lighting, limited camera viewpoints, and occlusions. Different from the visual-only method, the proposed approach incorporates spatially selective touch measurements to refine both the geometry and appearance of the 3D Gaussian representation. To guide the touch exploration, we introduce a two-stage sampling scheme that initially probes sparse regions and then concentrates on high-uncertainty boundaries identified from the reconstructed mesh. A geometric loss is proposed to ensure surface smoothness, resulting in improved geometry. Experimental results across diverse scenarios show consistent improvements in geometric accuracy. In the most challenging case with severe occlusion, the Chamfer Distance is reduced by over 15x, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating touch cues into 3D Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, our approach maintains a fully online pipeline, underscoring its feasibility in visually degraded environments.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted NOMA with Partial CSI and Mutual Coupling: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07909v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique. Its performance depends strongly on the wireless channel property, which can be enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this paper, we jointly optimize base station (BS) precoding and RIS configuration with unsupervised machine learning (ML), which looks for the optimal solution autonomously. In particular, we propose a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet inspired by domain knowledge in communication. Compared to state-of-the-art, the proposed approach combines analytical optimal BS precoding and ML-enabled RIS, has a high scalability to control more than 1000 RIS elements, has a low requirement for channel state information (CSI) in input, and addresses the mutual coupling between RIS elements. Beyond the considered problem, this work is an early contribution to domain knowledge enabled ML, which exploit the domain expertise of communication systems to design better approaches than general ML methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Design of Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Empowered RSMA-SWIPT System Under Channel Estimation Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the integration of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), and beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) to enhance the spectral-efficiency, energy-efficiency, coverage, and connectivity of future sixth-generation (6G) communication networks. Specifically, with a multiuser BD-RIS-empowered RSMA-SWIPT system, we jointly optimize the transmit precoding vectors, the common rate proportion of users, the power-splitting ratios, and scattering matrix of BD-RIS node, under the assumption of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Additionally, to better capture practical hardware behavior, we incorporate a nonlinear energy harvesting model under energy harvesting constraints. We design a robust optimization framework to maximize the system sum-rate, while explicitly accounting for the worst-case impact of CSI uncertainties. Further, we introduce an alternating optimization framework that partitions the problem into several blocks, which are optimized iteratively. More specifically, the transmit precoding vectors are optimized by reformulating the problem as a convex semidefinite programming through successive-convex approximation (SCA), whereas the power-splitting problem is solved using the MOSEK-enabled CVX toolbox. Subsequently, to optimize the scattering matrix of the BD-RIS, we first employ SCA to reformulate the problem into a convex form, and then design a manifold optimization strategy based on the Conjugate-Gradient method. Finally, numerical simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme provides significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks and demonstrates rapid convergence within a reasonable number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning for IRS-Assisted Wireless Networks: Securing Opportunistic Communications Against Byzantine Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum sensing and secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)--assisted opportunistic access under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. The sensing stage performs logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and attention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs with a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded number of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink design as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and signal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase shifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an augmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide provable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local curvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO) in a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP) surrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound (UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of the implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show higher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial attacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of eavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a practical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI availability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through joint learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutoMashup, a system for automatic mashup creation based on source separation, music analysis, and compatibility estimation. We propose using COCOLA to assess compatibility between separated stems and investigate whether general-purpose pretrained audio models (CLAP and MERT) can support zero-shot estimation of track pair compatibility. Our results show that mashup compatibility is asymmetric -- it depends on the role assigned to each track (vocals or accompaniment) -- and that current embeddings fail to reproduce the perceptual coherence measured by COCOLA. These findings underline the limitations of general-purpose audio representations for compatibility estimation in mashup creation.</description>

      <title>Communication-Learning Co-Design for Differentially Private Over-the-Air Federated Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-growing learning model size nowadays challenges the communication efficiency and privacy preservation of the traditional federated learning (FL). In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private (DP) over-the-air federated distillation (FD) framework, where wireless devices (WDs) periodically share noise-perturbed model outputs with the parameter server by harnessing the superposition property of multi-access channels. Accordingly, over-the-air FD enables the shared responsibility of the DP preservation on the low-dimensional disclosed signals among WDs. We study the communication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit power and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the intractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the strong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle this problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and privacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD round and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private over-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with largely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FlowSE: Flow Matching-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have shown impressive performance for speech enhancement, but they typically require 25 to 60 function evaluations in the inference phase, resulting in heavy computational complexity. Recently, a fine-tuning method was proposed to correct the reverse process, which significantly lowered the number of function evaluations (NFE). Flow matching is a method to train continuous normalizing flows which model probability paths from known distributions to unknown distributions including those described by diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose a speech enhancement based on conditional flow matching. The proposed method achieved the performance comparable to those for the diffusion-based speech enhancement with the NFE of 60 when the NFE was 5, and showed similar performance with the diffusion model correcting the reverse process at the same NFE from 1 to 5 without additional fine tuning procedure. We also have shown that the corresponding diffusion model derived from the conditional probability path with a modified optimal transport conditional vector field demonstrated similar performances with the NFE of 5 without any fine-tuning procedure.</description>

      <title>Speech Enhancement based on cascaded two flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) based on diffusion probabilistic models has exhibited impressive performance, while requiring a relatively high number of function evaluations (NFE). Recently, SE based on flow matching has been proposed, which showed competitive performance with a small NFE. Early approaches adopted the noisy speech as the only conditioning variable. There have been other approaches which utilize speech enhanced with a predictive model as another conditioning variable and to sample an initial value, but they require a separate predictive model on top of the generative SE model. In this work, we propose to employ an identical model based on flow matching for both SE and generating enhanced speech used as an initial starting point and a conditioning variable. Experimental results showed that the proposed method required the same or fewer NFEs even with two cascaded generative methods while achieving equivalent or better performances to the previous baselines.</description>

      <title>SLRTP2025 Sign Language Production Challenge: Methodology, Results, and Future Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33 participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare their work against a broader range of methods.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Adaptive Kalman Filtering via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown. However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport. This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.</description>

      <title>PySeizure: A single machine learning classifier framework to detect seizures in diverse datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy, yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative, open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and 0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case) without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption, complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating clinical integration.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Language Models Using EEG Microstate Features for Mental Workload Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the intersection of electroencephalography (EEG) microstates and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the assessment of cognitive load states. By utilizing EEG microstate features, the research aims to fine-tune LLMs for improved predictions of distinct cognitive states, specifically 'Rest' and 'Load'. The experimental design is delineated in four comprehensive stages: dataset collection and preprocessing, microstate segmentation and EEG backfitting, feature extraction paired with prompt engineering, and meticulous LLM model selection and refinement. Employing a supervised learning paradigm, the LLM is trained to identify cognitive load states based on EEG microstate features integrated into prompts, producing accurate discrimination of cognitive load. A curated dataset, linking EEG features to specified cognitive load conditions, underpins the experimental framework. The results indicate a significant improvement in model performance following the proposed fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of EEG-informed LLMs in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive AI applications. This approach not only contributes to the understanding of brain dynamics but also paves the way for advancements in machine learning techniques applicable to cognitive load and cognitive AI research.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Exploration of In-Memory Computing for Multi-Layer Perceptrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern computer architectures, the performance of many memory-bound workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph processing, databases) is limited by the data movement bottleneck that emerges when transferring large amounts of data between the main memory and the central processing unit (CPU). Processing-in-memory is an emerging computing paradigm that aims to alleviate this data movement bottleneck by performing computation close to or within the memory units, where data resides. One example of a prevalent workload whose performance is bound by the data movement bottleneck is the training and inference process of artificial neural networks. In this work, we analyze the potential of modern general-purpose PiM architectures to accelerate neural networks. To this end, we selected the UPMEM PiM system, the first commercially available real-world general-purpose PiM architecture. We compared the implementation of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in PiM with a sequential baseline running on an Intel Xeon CPU. The UPMEM implementation achieves up to $259\times$ better performance for inference of large batch sizes when compared against the CPU that exploits the size of the available PiM memory. Additionally, two smaller MLPs were implemented using UPMEM's working SRAM (WRAM), a scratchpad memory, to evaluate their performance against a low-power Nvidia Jetson graphics processing unit (GPU), providing further insights into the efficiency of UPMEM's PiM for neural network inference. Results show that using WRAM achieves kernel execution times for MLP inference of under $3$ ms, which is within the same order of magnitude as low-power GPUs.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Top Resource Broker System for Split Computing: An Approach to Distribute Cloud Computing Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G network architectures will usher in a wave of innovative services and capabilities, introducing concepts like split computing and dynamic processing nodes. This implicates a paradigm where accessing resources seamlessly aligns with diverse processing node characteristics, ensuring a uniform interface. In this landscape, the identity of the operator becomes inconsequential, paving the way for a collaborative ecosystem where multiple providers contribute to a shared pool of resources. At the core of this vision is the guarantee of specific performance parameters, precisely tailored to the location and service requirements. A consistent layer, as the abstraction of the complexities of different infrastructure providers, is needed to simplify service deployment. One promising approach is the introduction of an over-the-top broker for resource allocation, which streamlines the integration of these services into the network and cloud infrastructure of the future. This paper explores the role of the broker in two split computing scenarios. By abstracting the complexities of various infrastructures, the broker proves to be a versatile solution applicable not only to cloud environments but also to networks and beyond. Additionally, a detailed discussion of a proof-of-concept implementation provides insights into the broker's actual architectural framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) has emerged as a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks with enhanced adaptability through resource allocation co-design and intelligent environment awareness. However, dynamic interference and channel attenuation constrain the potential of the ISCC system. To address this challenge, we propose a novel movable antenna-empowered ISCC system. An achievable data rate maximization problem is formulated while guaranteeing the sensing and control quality-of-service (QoS) by optimizing the positions of the antennas and the beamforming strategy for communication, sensing, and control co-design. An efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the highly coupled non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AO-based algorithm achieves substantial gains in the achievable data rate and the control QoS compared with benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However, current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical digital systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for robust models for advanced powertrains.</description>

      <title>Cross-Subject and Cross-Montage EEG Transfer Learning via Individual Tangent Space Alignment and Spatial-Riemannian Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation. Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of publication.</description>

Abstract: 6G standardization is to start imminently, with commercial deployments expected before 2030. Its technical components and performance requirements are the focus of this article. Our emphasis is on the 6G radio access, especially MIMO, AI, waveforms, coding, signal constellations and integration with non-terrestrial networks. Whilst standardization has not yet formally started, the scope of the 6G study items has been defined. Our predictions in this paper are speculative as there are no results of the study yet, but our views are guided by implementation and deployment aspects. We expect that the views here will guide researchers and industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Mamba-FCS: Joint Spatio- Frequency Feature Fusion, Change-Guided Attention, and SeK Loss for Enhanced Semantic Change Detection in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) from remote sensing imagery requires models balancing extensive spatial context, computational efficiency, and sensitivity to class-imbalanced land-cover transitions. While Convolutional Neural Networks excel at local feature extraction but lack global context, Transformers provide global modeling at high computational costs. Recent Mamba architectures based on state-space models offer compelling solutions through linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling. In this study, we introduce Mamba-FCS, a SCD framework built upon Visual State Space Model backbone incorporating, a Joint Spatio-Frequency Fusion block incorporating log-amplitude frequency domain features to enhance edge clarity and suppress illumination artifacts, a Change-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly links the naturally intertwined BCD and SCD tasks, and a Separated Kappa (SeK) loss tailored for class-imbalanced performance optimization. Extensive evaluation on SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets shows that Mamba-FCS achieves state-of-the-art metrics, 88.62% Overall Accuracy, 65.78% F_scd, and 25.50% SeK on SECOND, 96.25% Overall Accuracy, 89.27% F_scd, and 60.26% SeK on Landsat-SCD. Ablation analyses confirm distinct contributions of each novel component, with qualitative assessments highlighting significant improvements in SCD. Our results underline the substantial potential of Mamba architectures, enhanced by proposed techniques, setting a new benchmark for effective and scalable semantic change detection in remote sensing applications. The complete source code, configuration files, and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1804.07553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced industrial applications for human-machine interaction such as augmented reality support for maintenance works or mobile control panels for operating production facility set high demands on underlying wireless connectivity solution. Based on 802.11 standard, this paper proposes a concept of a new system, which is capable of those requirements. For increasing reliability, an agile triple-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 60 GHz) communication system can be used. In order to deal with latency and deterministic channel access, PHY and MAC techniques such as new waveforms or hybrid MAC schemes are investigated. Integration of precise localization introduces new possibilities for safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Based Resource Allocator for Communication Networks with Dynamic User Utility Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) based resource allocation (RA) has recently gained significant attention due to its performance efficiency. However, most related studies assume an ideal case where the number of users and their utility demands, e.g., data rate constraints, are fixed, and the designed DL-based RA scheme exploits a policy trained only for these fixed parameters. Consequently, computationally complex policy retraining is required whenever these parameters change. In this paper, we introduce a DL-based resource allocator (ALCOR) that allows users to adjust their utility demands freely, such as based on their application layer requirements. ALCOR employs deep neural networks (DNNs) as the policy in a time-sharing problem. The underlying optimization algorithm iteratively optimizes the on-off status of users to satisfy their utility demands in expectation. The policy performs unconstrained RA (URA) -- RA without considering user utility demands -- among active users to maximize the sum utility (SU) at each time instant. Depending on the chosen URA scheme, ALCOR can perform RA in either a centralized or distributed scenario. The derived convergence analyses provide theoretical guarantees for ALCOR's convergence, and numerical experiments corroborate its effectiveness compared to meta-learning and reinforcement learning approaches.</description>

      <title>NOMA-CSK Integrated VLC System with Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Objective Power Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that synergistically combines Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) with Color Shift Keying (CSK) modulation to substantially boost spectral efficiency in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. A key challenge in the proposed NOMA-CSK architecture is managing the complex power allocation process, especially under cross-color interference caused by spectral overlap among LEDs and the limitations of optical filters. To overcome this, we develop an intelligent power allocation strategy powered by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning agent. Trained in a simulated indoor environment, the SAC agent dynamically distributes power among users with diverse channel conditions while balancing multiple performance objectives. Simulation results show that our SAC-based method significantly outperforms traditional approaches such as Gain Ratio Power Allocation (GRPA) and Normalized Gain Difference Power Allocation (NGDPA), achieving superior fairness, higher overall throughput, and reduced bit error rates - even under a challenging 10 dB SNR. Notably, the trained agent demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, maintaining optimal performance in unseen environments without requiring retraining. Overall, this work makes two major contributions: it presents a pioneering NOMA-CSK VLC system design and delivers a robust, adaptive power allocation solution critical for real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07480v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal language modeling has enabled breakthroughs for representation learning, yet remains unexplored in the realm of functional brain data for clinical phenotyping. This paper pioneers EEG-language models (ELMs) trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We propose to combine multimodal alignment in this novel domain with timeseries cropping and text segmentation, enabling an extension based on multiple instance learning to alleviate misalignment between irrelevant EEG or text segments. Our multimodal models significantly improve over EEG-only models across four clinical evaluations and for the first time enable zero-shot classification as well as retrieval of both neural signals and reports. In sum, these results highlight the potential of ELMs, representing significant progress for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the construction of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, ubiquitous connectivity has been achieved. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are mainly deployed in specific urban areas and use licensed spectrum. However, in remote areas where terrestrial infrastructure is sparse, licensed spectrum bands are often underutilized. To accommodate the increasing communication needs, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) can opportunistically access this idle spectrum to improve spectrum efficiency via spectrum sharing (SS). Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. In satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to manage mutual interference between NTN and TN effectively. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of SS in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gait Disorder Assessment Based on a Large-Scale Clinical Trial: WiFi vs. Video vs. Doctor's Visual Inspection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurological gait disorders affect a large population, significantly reducing life quality. This paper brings a foundational understanding to the potentials of emerging sensing modalities (e.g., WiFi) for gait disorder assessment, via conducting a one-year-long clinical trial in collaboration with the Neurology Associates of Santa Barbara. Our medical campaign encompasses 114 real subjects and a wide spectrum of disorders (e.g., Parkinson's, Neuropathy, Post Stroke, Dementia, Arthritis). We then develop the first WiFi-based gait disorder sensing system of its kind, distinguished by its scope of validation with a large and diverse patient cohort. To ensure generalizability, we mainly leverage publicly-accessible online videos of gait disorders for training, and develop a video-to-RF pipeline to convert them to synthetic RF training data. We then extensively test the system in a neurology center (i.e., the Neurology Associates of Santa Barbara). Additionally, we provide a 1-1 comparison with a vision-based system, by developing a vision-based gait assessment system under identical conditions, a first-of-its-kind comparison to our knowledge. We finally contrast both systems with neurologists' accuracy when basing evaluation solely on visual gait inspection, by designing/distributing a large survey to 70 neurologists, offering the first apples-to-apples comparison of these three sensing modalities. Our findings can help integrate these sensing systems into medical practice, working towards equitable healthcare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the site-specific distribution of the wireless channel within a particular environment of interest is essential to exploit the full potential of machine learning (ML) for wireless communications and radar applications. Generative modeling offers a promising framework to address this problem. However, existing approaches pose unresolved challenges, including the need for high-quality training data, limited generalizability, and a lack of physical interpretability. To address these issues, we combine the physics-related compressibility of wireless channels with generative modeling, in particular, sparse Bayesian generative modeling (SBGM), to learn the distribution of the underlying physical channel parameters. By leveraging the sparsity-inducing characteristics of SBGM, our methods can learn from compressed observations received by an access point (AP) during default online operation. Moreover, they are physically interpretable and generalize over system configurations without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>Wireless Energy Transfer Beamforming Optimization for Intelligent Transmitting Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless energy transfer (WET) is a promising technology for powering the growing ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) using power beacons (PBs). Recent research focuses on efficient PB architectures that can support numerous antennas. In this context, PBs equipped with intelligent surfaces present a promising approach, enabling physically large, reconfigurable arrays. Motivated by these advantages, this work aims to minimize the power consumption of a PB equipped with a passive intelligent transmitting surface (ITS) and a collocated digital beamforming-based feeder to charge multiple single-antenna devices. To model the PB's power consumption accurately, we consider power amplifiers nonlinearities, ITS control power, and feeder-to-ITS air interface losses. The resulting optimization problem is highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the high-power amplifier (HPA), the received power constraints at the devices, and the unit-modulus constraint imposed by the phase shifter configuration of the ITS. To tackle this issue, we apply successive convex approximation (SCA) to iteratively solve convex subproblems that jointly optimize the digital precoder and phase configuration. Given SCA's sensitivity to initialization, we propose an algorithm that ensures initialization feasibility while balancing convergence speed and solution quality. We compare the proposed ITS-equipped PB's power consumption against benchmark architectures featuring digital and hybrid analog-digital beamforming. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture efficiently scales with the number of RF chains and ITS elements. We also show that nonuniform ITS power distribution influences beamforming and can shift a device between near- and far-field regions, even with a constant aperture.</description>

      <title>SpectrumFM: Redefining Spectrum Cognition via Foundation Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.</description>

      <title>Expectation-maximization for structure determination directly from cryo-EM micrographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) measurement, called a micrograph, consists of multiple two-dimensional tomographic projections of a three-dimensional (3-D) molecular structure at unknown locations, taken under unknown viewing directions. All existing cryo-EM algorithmic pipelines first locate and extract the projection images, and then reconstruct the structure from the extracted images. However, if the molecular structure is small, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data is very low, making it challenging to accurately detect projection images within the micrograph. Consequently, all standard techniques fail in low-SNR regimes. To recover molecular structures from measurements of low SNR, and in particular small molecular structures, we devise an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the 3-D structure directly from the micrograph, bypassing the need to locate the projection images. We corroborate our computational scheme with numerical experiments and present successful structure recoveries from simulated noisy measurements.</description>

      <title>Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can stochastic gradient methods track a moving target? We address the problem of tracking multivariate time-varying parameters under noisy observations and potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the logarithmic postulated observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous and the learning rate to be sufficiently small. We validate our theoretical findings through simulation studies, showing that ISD filters outperform ESD filters in terms of accuracy and stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image steganography is an information-hiding technique that involves the surreptitious concealment of covert informational content within digital images. In this paper, we introduce ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$, a novel framework for concealing arbitrary binary data within images. Our approach synergistically leverages Random Shuffling, Fernet Symmetric Encryption, and Reed-Solomon Error Correction Codes to encode the secret payload, which is then discretely embedded into the carrier image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography. The combination of these methods addresses the vulnerability vectors of both security and resilience against bit-level corruption in the resultant stego-images. We show that our framework achieves a data payload of 3 bits per pixel for an RGB image, and mathematically assess the probability of successful transmission for the amalgamated $n$ message bits and $k$ error correction bits. Additionally, we find that ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$ yields good results upon being evaluated with multiple performance metrics, successfully eludes detection by various passive steganalysis tools, and is immune to simple active steganalysis attacks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Starscream-11813/SCReedSolo-Steganography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biosignals can be viewed as mixtures measuring particular physiological events, and blind source separation (BSS) aims to extract underlying source signals from mixtures. This paper proposes a self-supervised multi-encoder autoencoder (MEAE) to separate heartbeat-related source signals from photoplethysmogram (PPG), enhancing heart rate (HR) detection in noisy PPG data. The MEAE is trained on PPG signals from a large open polysomnography database without any pre-processing or data selection. The trained network is then applied to a noisy PPG dataset collected during the daily activities of nine subjects. The extracted heartbeat-related source signal significantly improves HR detection as compared to the original PPG. The absence of pre-processing and the self-supervised nature of the proposed method, combined with its strong performance, highlight the potential of MEAE for BSS in biosignal analysis.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Static IRS: 3D Shaped Beamforming for Area Coverage Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising paradigm to reconfigure the wireless environment for enhanced communication coverage and quality. However, to compensate for the double pathloss effect, massive IRS elements are required, raising concerns on the scalability of cost and complexity. This paper introduces a new architecture of quasi-static IRS (QS-IRS), which tunes element phases via mechanical adjustment or manually re-arranging the array topology. QS-IRS relies on massive production/assembly of purely passive elements only, and thus is suitable for ultra low-cost and large-scale deployment to enhance long-term coverage. To achieve this end, an IRS-aided area coverage problem is formulated, which explicitly considers the element radiation pattern (ERP), with the newly introduced shape masks for the mainlobe, and the sidelobe constraints to reduce energy leakage. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the difference-of-convex (DC) and successive convex approximation (SCA) procedure is proposed, which achieves shaped beamforming with power gains close to that of the joint optimization algorithm, but with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/TemporalMorphing/EnvelopeMorphing.</description>
