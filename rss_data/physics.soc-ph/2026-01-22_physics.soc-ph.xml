      <title>Understanding Crash Dynamics and Severity of EV Paratransit: Evidence From Easy Bike Accidents in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Easy bikes have emerged as a popular and affordable mode of last-mile transport in Bangladesh, yet their widespread use has been accompanied by growing concerns about road safety. This study investigates the underlying factors influencing both the occurrence and severity of easy bike crashes by analyzing nationwide crash data spanning from 2016 to 2024. The findings reveal that crashes predominantly occur during daytime, on paved (pucca) roads, and in low-density peri-urban areas. Intersections and curved road segments are also identified as high-risk zones for crash occurrence. Crash severity analysis, supported by binary logit and probit models, emphasizes that the type of collision plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of fatal outcomes. Pedestrian-involved crashes and rear-end collisions are more frequently associated with fatalities, whereas crashes involving overturns tend to result in less severe consequences. In contrast, environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and time of day exhibit limited impact on crash severity. The distribution of crash types also varies across vehicle categories, with motorcycles, buses, and trucks commonly involved in more dangerous collision scenarios. These findings focus on the urgent need for targeted road safety interventions focusing on specific crash types, high-risk locations such as intersections and curves, and vulnerable road users. Moreover, the study underscores the necessity for improving crash data quality, especially in underreported cases, to support informed decision-making. Based on these insights, the study also proposes a set of evidence-based and context-specific interventions aimed at reducing both the frequency and severity of easy bike crashes in Bangladesh.</description>

      <title>Modeling Accessibility-Constrained Networks with Time-Weighted Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessibility for the physically disabled is a prevalent issue on university campuses, where stairs and steep slopes make navigating campus arduous. Our work proposes a pipeline to model a college campus as a network by combining Strava and other APIs with depth-first search to derive insights into wheelchair-accessible paths. We then develop a custom Least Resistance algorithm to compute optimal paths between selected nodes and benchmark it against Dijkstra's algorithm. We highlight crucial nodes on campus using centrality measures, demonstrating that wheelchair users are significantly constrained by the lack of mobility options and accommodations. Our pipeline is designed to support future expansion in scope and accuracy, while enabling the proposal of engineering solutions to improve campus accessibility for physically disabled individuals.</description>

      <title>How the Shale Revolution is Shaping the Future of the Oil and Gas Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shale revolution, driven by advances in horizontal drilling, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, and cyclic gas injection, has reshaped the oil and gas industry over the past two decades. In the United States, these technologies transformed ultra-low permeability shale formations into commercially viable resources, increasing crude oil production from 5 million bpd in 2008 to more than 12 million by 2019. Horizontal drilling became the standard after 2010, with nearly 200,000 horizontal wells completed by the end of 2023, accounting for more than 80% of all new wells in the US. This success is now being replicated in Argentina making the country a leading unconventional producer. The common driver in both cases is the mass manufacturing approach, which industrializes oil production through standardized well designs, repeatable workflows, multi-well pad drilling, and continuous process optimization. Supported by a competitive oilfield service market and a skilled technical workforce, this model has reduced drilling times from months to weeks and cut well costs by half over the past decade. New technologies such as precision geosteering, advanced completion designs, real-time drilling analytics, and cyclic gas injection continue to improve efficiency and productivity. Applying these methods and technologies to conventional reservoirs could significantly expand global production capacity and place sustained downward pressure on crude oil prices. This paper argues that in a period of slowing economic growth and potential financial deleveraging, abundant supply from both unconventional and conventional developments could extend a prolonged phase of relatively low oil prices. Such a scenario would have far-reaching implications for energy policy, investment strategies, and the competitive position of oil-producing nations.</description>

      <title>Quantum scientists for disarmament: a manifesto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We, as researchers in quantum science and technology, are publishing this manifesto to express our deep concerns about the current geopolitical situation and the global race to rearm. We firmly oppose all forms of militarization in our societies and, in particular, within the academic world. We categorically reject the use of our research for military applications, population control, or surveillance. We stand against the practice of military funding for research. This manifesto is a call to action: to confront the elephant in the room of quantum research, and to unite all researchers who share our views. Our main goals are: i) To express, as a unified collective, our rejection of the use of our research for military purposes; ii) To open a debate in our community about the ethical implications of quantum research for military purposes; iii) To create a forum where concerned scientists can share their opinions and join forces in support of demilitarized research; iv) To advocate for the establishment of a public database listing all research projects at public universities funded by military or defense agencies. In what follows, we lay out our concerns and the rationale behind our opposition to the militarization of quantum research.</description>

      <title>Introducing a Novel Systems Thinking approach inspired by STPA: Road Safety Intervention design case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the latest provisional statistics released by the UK Department for Transport, Great Britain recorded 1,633 road deaths in 2024, representing a slight increase from 2023 and raising concerns about safety progress, which indicates that preventable fatalities remain a challenge. The deployment of advanced mobility systems, even certified and safety-assessed, is not sufficient to deliver improved safety outcomes, and existing road infrastructure is not sufficiently equipped to prevent severe collisions. Successful application of the ``Safe System'' approach demands systems thinking in an integrated and holistic manner, encompassing all aspects of road safety. This paper argues that road safety must be managed as a complex socio-technical system where risk evolves dynamically and must be continuously monitored. To address these safety gaps, we propose a systems thinking approach that identifies factors contributing to fatal outcomes and mitigates them. The framework consists of four steps: 1) List stakeholders who influence road safety, 2) Model the interactions between these stakeholders, 3) List assumptions that might be identified as factors for fatalities, and 4) Monitor these assumptions throughout the system lifecycle. The approach is applied to the United Kingdom (UK) road network to demonstrate feasibility. The study provides actionable guidance and new KPIs categories for stakeholders to implement road safety monitoring and eliminate any unreasonable road safety risks.</description>

      <title>Meeting the Needs of the Global Quantum Science Community: A Call to Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2025 marks one hundred years since the discovery of quantum mechanics. In the century since then, quantum science has blossomed into a global community composed of academics, engineers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The world is currently in the middle of the so-called second quantum revolution, with increased public awareness of quantum science and technology, and growing investment in both quantum hardware and software applications. However, representation remains low among historically marginalized groups: women, LGBTQ+, BIPOC, and people from the global south make up disproportionately few physicists. There are numerous efforts to improve diversity within quantum science, including through workforce development. But many of the changes enacted at the highest levels have failed to result in real change, as highlighted and discussed in the recent Women For Quantum Manifesto of Values. Here, we seek to echo and amplify the need for real change in the quantum ecosystem, emphasizing intersectionality and a feminist approach that centers the most vulnerable members of the quantum community: young students and researchers, especially those communities historically marginalized from quantum science.
  This report is our attempt to help quantum communities meet this need; we have conducted a survey of quantum scientists all over the world, and here we include both a preliminary report of our findings and policy suggestions we have built to address them. The primary results of our survey are that, 1) marginalized quantum scientists are experiencing hardships and challenges more than their more privileged peers across all metrics, 2) that this fact is hurting retention of diverse, talented quantum scientists in our field, and 3) quantum EDI is an investment in talent retention and resilience building, which are essential for a thriving, globally competitive quantum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Assessing the livability within the 15-minute city concept based on mobile phone data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cities promote walkability through concepts such as the compact city and 15-minute city to enhance urban livability, yet few methods link spatial walkability features to empirically measured livability and account for temporal dynamics. The method developed for this study uses mobile phone data from the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Finland) to assess whether commonly used, literature-derived livability indicators (diversity, density, proximity, accessibility) predict observed human activity patterns across different times of day.
  We constructed two key dimensions of livability: attractiveness and walkability with quantifiable sub-indicators that were selected based on literature. Our analysis shows that walkability, and even more so the combined livability index, correlates with activity patterns, outperforming the pure attractiveness perspective. However, this relationship is temporally unstable, significantly weakening at night and fluctuating daily. Moreover, based on Geographically Weighted Regression analysis, our results reveal significant spatial variation in the relationship between livability and the intensity of human activities. The findings suggest that traditional urban planning goals, such as functional diversity to enhance walkability, contribute to livability but have a limited impact on the 15-minute city's overall sustainable mobility objectives, necessitating a larger-scale perspective and more functionally profiled approaches for urban development.</description>

      <title>How Recommendation Algorithms Shape Social Networks: An Adaptive Voter Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of social media and recommendation algorithms has sparked concerns about their role in fostering opinion polarization and echo chambers. We study these phenomena using an adaptive voter model to compare two connection mechanisms: "free" global rewiring, where individuals connect with anyone sharing their opinion, and "friend-of-a-friend" local rewiring, which mimics algorithmic link recommendations on platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn. Simulations across different network topologies reveal that local rewiring increases final-state polarization of the system and fragments social networks into many disconnected components. The usual phase transition into two disconnected components turns into a fragmentation of smaller components, leading to an increase in echo chambers as well as many isolated nodes. This effect is most pronounced in clustered networks with high homophily in rewiring, illustrating how recommendation algorithms can intensify social fragmentation by changing the very structure of the network.</description>

      <title>Dirac's Dilemma of the Economy of Inheritance: Parental Care, Equality of Opportunity, and Managed Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a brief reflection on the principles of human society, P. A. M. Dirac articulated a structural tension between two widely affirmed norms: that it is good and natural for parents to improve the prospects of their own children, and that justice requires that all children have equal opportunities in life. These principles, each compelling on its own, cannot be fully realized together. This paper reconstructs Dirac's dilemma, connects it to the dynamics of compounding advantage and inheritance, and situates it within the broader history of political philosophy, including the work of Rawls, Dworkin, Cohen, Brighouse and Swift, Nozick, Murphy and Nagel, and others. The paper argues that attempts to eliminate the resulting injustices entirely risk damaging the non--zero--sum structures that generate general prosperity, and defends a position of "managed inequality": a robust social floor and real mobility, combined with limits on extreme dynastic accumulation and an explicit acceptance of some residual, but constrained, inherited advantage.</description>

      <title>The Maintenance and Necessity of Universal Rules: Scale, Hierarchy, the Cost of Justice, and Civilizational Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14325v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon previous research, this paper further explores the topological foundations for maintaining universal rules within ultra-large-scale societies. It finds that in small-scale societies, absolute egalitarianism and the rule of law can be compatible through peer monitoring within a fully connected network. However, in ultra-large-scale societies, to maintain high-dimensional rules capable of protecting innovation and property rights, a complex hierarchical structure including "high-fragility" nodes must be constructed. Through quantitative analysis of power structures, this paper proves that a flattened, two-tier structure inevitably leads to the degradation of the rule of law. Only a social topology with sufficient hierarchical depth can escape the deathly trap of the Leviathan while expanding in scale, thereby sustaining the dynamic evolution of civilization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective motion in animal groups provide examples of emergent, decentralised coordination. Here, we examine a bottom-up model of collective behavior based on Future State Maximisation (FSM). In this model agents seek to maximise the diversity of their future visual states over a finite time horizon. We further assume that a subset of agents have a directional bias, e.g. towards different destinations. We observe swarm fragmentation on increasing (i) the strength of these preferences, or (ii) the difference in preferred directions, or (iii) the number of biased agents. Depending on these factors, biased agents can leave the swarm alone, leaving behind all other agents, or they can entrain some fraction of the group to leave with them. We further study the role of a classical nearest-neighbor alignment term on cohesion. Notably, we identify the existence of an finite, optimal coupling strength that suppresses fragmentation and maximises the flock cohesion. Our results demonstrate that FSM can be successfully combined with classical flocking rules, offering a flexible framework for modeling intelligent collective systems.</description>

      <title>The missing links: Evaluating contact tracing with incomplete data in large metropolitan areas during an epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact tracing (CT) plays a pivotal role in controlling early epidemic spread, particularly when a novel infectious disease emerges. However, the quantitative impact of missing information -- such as untraced cases or unnotified contacts -- on the effectiveness of CT remains insufficiently understood. Using a stochastic agent-based model with sociodemographics from metropolitan areas in South Korea, we simulate how different forms of information loss affect epidemic spreading dynamics. We construct information-loss scenarios based on two types: infector-omission (IO) and contact-omission (CO), including selective (SCO) and uniform (UCO) scenarios; IO corresponds to the omission of infected individuals (nodes) from the tracing process, leading to the loss of all movement trajectories and downstream transmission links originating from them, whereas CO corresponds to the omission of specific contact events (edges), in which infected individuals are identified but some of their transmission links fail to be detected or notified. The sensitivity of epidemic dynamics to increasing omission rates differs markedly between the two types: IO scenarios exhibit substantially stronger and more abrupt changes in transmission structure and epidemic outcomes, whereas CO scenarios produce more gradual effects. In both scenarios, the magnitude of these effects varies across cities, with a lower-population city (Busan) showing greater tolerance to information loss than the largest city (Seoul), underscoring the importance of regional tailoring in CT strategies. Both IO and CO scenarios also lead to an increase in the transmission network diameter as information loss grows, indicating that a small network diameter reflects effective contact tracing that limits the depth of transmission chains.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Ulanowicz's optimal structural resilience in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the mathematical existence and asymptotic properties of Ulanowicz's structural resilience in complex systems such as supply chain networks. While ecological evidence suggests that sustainable systems gravitate toward an optimal state at $\alpha = 1/\mathrm{e}$, the universality of this configuration in generalized networks remains theoretically unverified. We prove that while optimal resilience is unattainable in two-node networks due to structural over-determinacy, it exists for any directed graph with $N_\mathcal{V} \geq 3$. By constructing a symmetric network model with three types of link weights $(x, y, z)$ and uniform marginal distributions, we derive the governing equations for the optimal resilience configuration. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that as the network size $N_\mathcal{V}$ increases, the link weights required to maintain optimal resilience exhibit a power-law scaling behavior: the adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-1})$, while the non-adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-2})$, both accompanied by specific logarithmic corrections. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the optimal resilience framework and provides a unified perspective on how entropy-based principles govern the robustness and evolution of large-scale complex networks, which may offer quantitative guidance for designing large-scale networked systems under robustness constraints.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the impact of cross-order hyperdegree correlations in contagion processes on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contagion processes in social systems often involve interactions that go beyond pairwise contacts. Higher-order networks, represented as hypergraphs, have been widely used to model multi-body interactions, and their presence can drastically alter contagion dynamics compared to traditional network models. However, existing analytical approaches typically assume independence between pairwise and higher-order degrees, and thus study their roles in isolation. In this paper, we develop an effective hyperdegree model (EHDM) to describe Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics on hypergraphs that explicitly captures correlations between the distribution of groups with different sizes. Our effective hyperdegree model shows excellent agreement with stochastic simulations across different types of higher-order networks, including those with heterogeneous degree distributions. We explore the critical role of cross-order degree correlations, specifically, whether nodes that are hubs in pairwise interactions also serve as hubs in higher-order interactions. We show that positive correlation decreases the epidemic threshold and anti-correlation temporally desynchronizes infection pathways (pairwise and group interactions). Finally, we demonstrate that, depending on the level of correlation, the optimal control strategy shifts -- from one that is purely pairwise- or higher-order-focused to one in which a mixed strategy becomes optimal.</description>

      <title>Assessing Waste Heat Utilization in Power-to-Heat-to-Power Storage Systems for Cost-Effective Building Electrification</title>

Abstract: Fully electrifying the building sector requires not only the widespread adoption of photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption and heat pumps, but also the integration of cost-effective energy storage solutions. Hybridizing lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with power to heat to power storage (PHPS) systems, thermal batteries capable of thermal-to-electric energy conversion, offers a promising and economically viable solution. PHPS systems dispatch combined heat and power by utilizing the low-temperature waste heat generated during the thermal to electric energy conversion process. This study investigates the technoeconomic impacts of waste heat use in PHPS systems integrated with Li-ion batteries and heat pumps to support the decarbonization of the building sector. Two distinct strategies are evaluated: direct use of waste heat to meet heating demands; and the use of waste heat to enhance the heat pump's coefficient of performance. Results show that supplying the waste heat at the demand setpoint temperature is the best solution to integrate PHPS cost-effectively, although enhancing the heat pump's COP with waste heat also yields notable economic gains. Additionally, leveraging waste heat significantly lowers the minimum thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency required for PHPS systems to achieve economic viability. Optimal PHPS designs enable large-scale energy storage and charging capacities, thereby enhancing PV self-consumption rates and reducing the levelized cost of energy. The analysis also reveals that hybridizing PHPS with Li-ion batteries may rise as the optimal solution for moderately priced PHPS systems, with the reduction in levelized cost being more pronounced in solar-dominated regions.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Critical Cascades and a Feasibility Transition for the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient--a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses that recur over finite coherence timescales. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition--functional percolation--requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported over finite coherence intervals, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>

      <title>Extending the Biswas--Chatterjee--Sen model with nonconformists and inflexibles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally, the Biswas--Chatterjee--Sen model was shown to exhibit an order/disorder phase transition for a sufficiently large number of negative interactions among actors. In this paper, the model is extended by the existence of nonconformists and inflexible. Nonconformists are actors who do not follow the original model rules, but in different ways do something opposite while inflexibles are those who do not change their opinions. Both discrete and continuous opinions are considered. With direct Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field calculations, we check the influence of fractions of nonconformists and inflexibles on the mean opinion in the system. With the mean-field calculations we identify ranges of fractions of nonconformists where ordered phase of the system is available. The results of the mean-field calculations perfectly match the results of the Monte Carlo simulations. We consider inflexibles adhered: (i) to extreme opinions; (ii) to specific opinions and (iii) chosen independently of their initial opinion. For inflexibles adhered to specific and extreme opinions they play a role of effective bias suppressing disorder phase in the system. The qualitative results of introducing nonconformists (inflexibles) in various ways (discrete/continuous opinions and annealed/quenched disorder) are roughly the same. However, for the model extended by inflexibles, we can observe a systematic shift of the mean order parameter to its higher values for quenched disorder compared with annealed disorder.</description>

      <title>Learning from Discriminatory Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.08189v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised learning systems are trained using historical data and, if the data was tainted by discrimination, they may unintentionally learn to discriminate against protected groups. We propose that fair learning methods, despite training on potentially discriminatory datasets, shall perform well on fair test datasets. Such dataset shifts crystallize application scenarios for specific fair learning methods. For instance, the removal of direct discrimination can be represented as a particular dataset shift problem. For this scenario, we propose a learning method that provably minimizes model error on fair datasets, while blindly training on datasets poisoned with direct additive discrimination. The method is compatible with existing legal systems and provides a solution to the widely discussed issue of protected groups' intersectionality by striking a balance between the protected groups. Technically, the method applies probabilistic interventions, has causal and counterfactual formulations, and is computationally lightweight - it can be used with any supervised learning model to prevent direct and indirect discrimination via proxies while maximizing model accuracy for business necessity.</description>
