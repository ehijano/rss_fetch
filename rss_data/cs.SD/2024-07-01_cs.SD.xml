      <title>Network Bending of Diffusion Models for Audio-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the first steps towards the creation of a tool which enables artists to create music visualizations using pre-trained, generative, machine learning models. First, we investigate the application of network bending, the process of applying transforms within the layers of a generative network, to image generation diffusion models by utilizing a range of point-wise, tensor-wise, and morphological operators. We identify a number of visual effects that result from various operators, including some that are not easily recreated with standard image editing tools. We find that this process allows for continuous, fine-grain control of image generation which can be helpful for creative applications. Next, we generate music-reactive videos using Stable Diffusion by passing audio features as parameters to network bending operators. Finally, we comment on certain transforms which radically shift the image and the possibilities of learning more about the latent space of Stable Diffusion based on these transforms.</description>

      <title>SAML: Speaker Adaptive Mixture of LoRA Experts for End-to-End ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) models have achieved excellent results in many tasks. However, conventional MoE models are often very large, making them challenging to deploy on resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose a novel speaker adaptive mixture of LoRA experts (SAML) approach, which uses low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules as experts to reduce the number of trainable parameters in MoE. Specifically, SAML is applied to the quantised and personalised end-to-end automatic speech recognition models, which combines test-time speaker adaptation to improve the performance of heavily compressed models in speaker-specific scenarios. Experiments have been performed on the LibriSpeech and the TED-LIUM 3 corpora. Remarkably, with a 7x reduction in model size, 29.1% and 31.1% relative word error rate reductions were achieved on the quantised Whisper model and Conformer-based attention-based encoder-decoder ASR model respectively, comparing to the original full precision models.</description>

      <title>RealMAN: A Real-Recorded and Annotated Microphone Array Dataset for Dynamic Speech Enhancement and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of deep learning-based multichannel speech enhancement and source localization systems relies heavily on the simulation of room impulse response and multichannel diffuse noise, due to the lack of large-scale real-recorded datasets. However, the acoustic mismatch between simulated and real-world data could degrade the model performance when applying in real-world scenarios. To bridge this simulation-to-real gap, this paper presents a new relatively large-scale Real-recorded and annotated Microphone Array speech&amp;Noise (RealMAN) dataset. The proposed dataset is valuable in two aspects: 1) benchmarking speech enhancement and localization algorithms in real scenarios; 2) offering a substantial amount of real-world training data for potentially improving the performance of real-world applications. Specifically, a 32-channel array with high-fidelity microphones is used for recording. A loudspeaker is used for playing source speech signals. A total of 83-hour speech signals (48 hours for static speaker and 35 hours for moving speaker) are recorded in 32 different scenes, and 144 hours of background noise are recorded in 31 different scenes. Both speech and noise recording scenes cover various common indoor, outdoor, semi-outdoor and transportation environments, which enables the training of general-purpose speech enhancement and source localization networks. To obtain the task-specific annotations, the azimuth angle of the loudspeaker is annotated with an omni-direction fisheye camera by automatically detecting the loudspeaker. The direct-path signal is set as the target clean speech for speech enhancement, which is obtained by filtering the source speech signal with an estimated direct-path propagation filter.</description>

      <title>ManiWAV: Learning Robot Manipulation from In-the-Wild Audio-Visual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio signals provide rich information for the robot interaction and object properties through contact. These information can surprisingly ease the learning of contact-rich robot manipulation skills, especially when the visual information alone is ambiguous or incomplete. However, the usage of audio data in robot manipulation has been constrained to teleoperated demonstrations collected by either attaching a microphone to the robot or object, which significantly limits its usage in robot learning pipelines. In this work, we introduce ManiWAV: an 'ear-in-hand' data collection device to collect in-the-wild human demonstrations with synchronous audio and visual feedback, and a corresponding policy interface to learn robot manipulation policy directly from the demonstrations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system through four contact-rich manipulation tasks that require either passively sensing the contact events and modes, or actively sensing the object surface materials and states. In addition, we show that our system can generalize to unseen in-the-wild environments, by learning from diverse in-the-wild human demonstrations.

      <title>Less is More: Accurate Speech Recognition &amp; Translation without Web-Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech recognition and translation rely on hundreds of thousands of hours of Internet speech data. We argue that state-of-the art accuracy can be reached without relying on web-scale data. Canary - multilingual ASR and speech translation model, outperforms current state-of-the-art models - Whisper, OWSM, and Seamless-M4T on English, French, Spanish, and German languages, while being trained on an order of magnitude less data than these models. Three key factors enables such data-efficient model: (1) a FastConformer-based attention encoder-decoder architecture (2) training on synthetic data generated with machine translation and (3) advanced training techniques: data-balancing, dynamic data blending, dynamic bucketing and noise-robust fine-tuning. The model, weights, and training code will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>BESTOW: Efficient and Streamable Speech Language Model with the Best of Two Worlds in GPT and T5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating speech understanding capabilities into pretrained large-language models has become a vital research direction (SpeechLLM). The previous architectures can be categorized as: i) GPT-style, prepend speech prompts to the text prompts as a sequence of LLM inputs like a decoder-only model; ii) T5-style, introduce speech cross-attention to each layer of the pretrained LLMs. We propose BESTOW architecture to bring the BESt features from TwO Worlds into a single model that is highly efficient and has strong multitask capabilities. Moreover, there is no clear streaming solution for either style, especially considering the solution should generalize to speech multitask. We reformulate streamable SpeechLLM as a read-write policy problem and unifies the offline and streaming research with BESTOW architecture. Hence we demonstrate the first open-source SpeechLLM solution that enables Streaming and Multitask at scale (beyond ASR) at the same time. This streamable solution achieves very strong performance on a wide range of speech tasks (ASR, AST, SQA, unseen DynamicSuperb). It is end-to-end optimizable, with lower training/inference cost, and demonstrates LLM knowledge transferability to speech.</description>

      <title>Advancing Airport Tower Command Recognition: Integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation and Broadcasted Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate recognition of aviation commands is vital for flight safety and efficiency, as pilots must follow air traffic control instructions precisely. This paper addresses challenges in speech command recognition, such as noisy environments and limited computational resources, by advancing keyword spotting technology. We create a dataset of standardized airport tower commands, including routine and emergency instructions. We enhance broadcasted residual learning with squeeze-and-excitation and time-frame frequency-wise squeeze-and-excitation techniques, resulting in our BC-SENet model. This model focuses on crucial information with fewer parameters. Our tests on five keyword spotting models, including BC-SENet, demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our model advancements in improving speech command recognition for aviation safety and efficiency in noisy, high-stakes environments. Additionally, BC-SENet shows comparable performance on the common Google Speech Command dataset.</description>

      <title>Self-Distillation Prototypes Network: Learning Robust Speaker Representations without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02774v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training speaker-discriminative and robust speaker verification systems without explicit speaker labels remains a persisting challenge. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised speaker verification approach, Self-Distillation Prototypes Network (SDPN), which effectively facilitates self-supervised speaker representation learning. SDPN assigns the representation of the augmented views of an utterance to the same prototypes as the representation of the original view, thereby enabling effective knowledge transfer between the views. Originally, due to the lack of negative pairs in the SDPN training process, the network tends to align positive pairs very closely in the embedding space, a phenomenon known as model collapse. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a diversity regularization term to embeddings in SDPN. Comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of SDPN in self-supervised speaker verification. SDPN sets a new state-of-the-art on the VoxCeleb1 speaker verification evaluation benchmark, achieving Equal Error Rate 1.80%, 1.99%, and 3.62% for trial VoxCeleb1-O, VoxCeleb1-E and VoxCeleb1-H respectively, without using any speaker labels in training. Ablation studies show that both proposed learnable prototypes in self-distillation network and diversity regularization contribute to the verification performance.</description>
