      <title>Factorized QED and QCD Contribution to Deeply Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of next-to-leading order (NLO) factorized QED and QCD contributions to the short-distance hard coefficients of inclusive lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in a joint QED and QCD factorization approach. Unlike the traditional radiative correction approach to handle the collision-induced QED contributions to DIS, QED radiation from all charged leptons and quarks are treated equally, and their collinear sensitivities are systematically factorized into corresponding universal lepton and parton distribution functions. We demonstrate that the NLO factorized QED contribution is completely infrared safe and calculable without the need of any parameters other than the standard factorization scale in the same way as the factorized QCD contribution. We discuss the potential impact of this joint factorization approach on the extraction of partonic information from lepton-hadron DIS.</description>

      <title>Electroexcitation of Nucleon Resonances and the Emergence of Hadron Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an understanding of phenomena driven by the emergence of hadron mass (EHM) is one of the most challenging problems in the Standard Model. This discussion focuses on the impact of results on nucleon resonance \texorpdfstring{($N^\ast$)} electroexcitation amplitudes (or \texorpdfstring{$\gamma_vpN^\ast$} electrocouplings) obtained from experiments during the 6-GeV era in Hall~B at Jefferson Lab on understanding EHM. Analyzed using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs), these results have revealed new pathways for the elucidation of EHM. A good description of the \texorpdfstring{$\Delta(1232)3/2^+$}, \texorpdfstring{$N(1440)1/2^+$}, and \texorpdfstring{$\Delta(1600)3/2^+$} electrocouplings, achieved by CSM analyses that express a realistic dressed quark mass function, sheds light on the strong interaction dynamics that underlies EHM. Extensions to nucleon resonance studies for higher-mass states are outlined, as well as experimental results anticipated in the 12-GeV era at Jefferson Lab and those that would be enabled by a further increase of the beam energy to 22~GeV.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nuclear Schiff and electric dipole moments in nuclei with an octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformed nuclei exhibit enhanced moments that violate time-reversal invariance ($T$) and parity ($P$). This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation. The uncertainty of our estimates may exceed a factor of 10.</description>

      <title>Emulating multi-channel scattering based on the eigenvector continuation in the discrete basis formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an emulator for a multi-channel scattering problem based on the eigenvector continuation. To this end, we employ the Kohn variational principle formulated in the discrete basis formalism. We apply this to one-dimensional scattering problems with a Gaussian barrier. Both for a single-channel and two-channel problems, we demonstrate that the penetration probability as well as the wave functions are well reproduced by the emulator. In particular, the energy dependence of the penetrability in a wider range of energy from well below the barrier to well above the barrier is successfully reproduced.</description>

      <title>$\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ 3-body cluster structures and dineutron breaking in ${}^8 \mathrm{He}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $0_2^+$ state of ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ has been discovered by a recent experiment, which suggested a developed cluster structure of spatially correlated neutron pairs, called "dineutrons" (${}^2n$). We aim to investigate the structure of ${}^8\mathrm{He}(0^+_1)$ and ${}^8\mathrm{He}(0^+_2)$ to clarify the monopole excitation mode in ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ system while focusing on the $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ cluster structures and the breaking of ${}^2n$ clusters. We apply a microscopic cluster model with the generator coordinate method for the $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ cluster and ${}^6\mathrm{He}+{}^2n$ cluster dynamics. The $p_{3/2}$-closure component, which is induced by the spin-orbit force, is also incorporated. The present calculation reasonably reproduces the experimental data of the properties of ${}^8\mathrm{He}$, such as $2n$ and $4n$ separation energies, energy spectra, and radii. The spatially developed cluster structure of the $0_2^+$ state is obtained. The $0_1^+$ and $0_2^+$ states have dominant components of $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ 3-body cluster, but contain significant ${}^2n$ breaking components which contribute to the energy gain and size shrinking of the ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ system. The monopole excitation in ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ is regarded as a radial excitation, which is similar to that in ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. The $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ cluster structures play a dominant role in ${}^8\mathrm{He}(0_{1,2}^+)$, and the mixing of the dineutron breaking contributes to significant structural effects.</description>

      <title>Estimating Longitudinal Polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ Hyperons at Relativistic Energies using Hydrodynamic and Transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global and local spin polarization measurements of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons by STAR and ALICE Collaborations open up an immense interest in investigating the spin polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Recent studies suggest the transverse component of the vorticity field is responsible for the global spin polarization. In contrast, the longitudinal component of the vorticity field accounts for the local spin polarization. The local (longitudinal) spin polarization of $\Lambda$-hyperons arises due to the anisotropic flows in the transverse plane, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity along the beam direction. In this study, we derive a simple solution relating the longitudinal mean spin vector with the second-order anisotropic flow coefficient due to the thermal shear tensor for an ideal uncharged fluid in a longitudinal boost invariant scenario. The present study focuses on the local spin polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Further, we explore the azimuthal angle, centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) dependence study of longitudinal spin polarization using hydrodynamic and transport models. All these models predict a maximum longitudinal spin polarization in mid-central collisions around 30-50 \% centrality at $p_{\rm T} \approx$ 2.0 - 3.0 GeV/c. These findings on longitudinal spin polarization advocate the existence of a thermal medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Transport and response coefficients in second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics with quantum corrections: probing the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A functional measure encompasses quantum corrections and is explored in the fluid/gravity correspondence. Corrections to response and transport coefficients in the second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics are proposed, including the ones to the pressure, the relaxation time, and the shear relaxation. Their dependence on the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) temperature sets a temperature dependence on the running parameter encoding the one-loop quantum gravity correction, driven by a functional measure. The experimental range of the bulk viscosity-to-entropy density ratio of the QGP corroborates the existence of the functional measure.</description>
