      <title>Python4Physics: A physics outreach program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a summer outreach program developed to cultivate interest in physics in particular and physical sciences more broadly among high school and early college students using small projects in the Python programming language. We discuss the lessons we learned in the hopes that they will be valuable to other physicists in planning their own outreach efforts. We also provide links to resources and materials from the Python4Physics program, which we hope might be useful in other outreach programs.</description>

      <title>A computational materials science paradigm for a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) bring the excitement of research into the classroom to improve learning and the sense of belonging in the field. They can reach more students, earlier in their studies, than typical undergraduate research. Key aspects are: students learn and use research methods, give input into the project, generate new research data, and analyze it to draw conclusions that are not known beforehand. CUREs are common in other fields but have been rare in materials science and engineering. I propose a paradigm for computational material science CUREs, enabled by web-based simulation tools from nanoHUB.org that require minimal computational skills. After preparatory exercises, students each calculate part of a set of closely related materials, following a defined protocol to contribute to a novel class dataset which they analyze, and also calculate an additional property of their choice. This approach has been used successfully in several class projects.</description>
