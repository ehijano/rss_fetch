      <title>Structural States of Filamentary Microgravity Dusty Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the filamentary structural states of microgravity dusty plasma using data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility on board the International Space Station. The dust particles in the PK-4 discharge are observed to form field-aligned filaments and nested (layered) structures in response to changes in the plasma conditions, neutral gas pressure, and externally applied electric field. This work explores the possibility that these filamentary dusty plasmas exhibit properties of liquid crystals. The structural characteristics of the dust clouds are studied for nine sets of pressure-current conditions using pair correlation functions calculated for particles (i) within individual filaments, (ii) within the central plane of the dust cloud, and (iii) within successive planes of the cloud (the 3D cloud). It is observed that, at low pressure ($\approx$30 Pa), the entire cloud is in a weakly crystalline state with similar coupling of particles within filaments and among neighboring filaments. At high pressure ($\approx$70 Pa), the order within filaments improves (enhanced crystalline behavior), while the degree of freedom of filaments to move with respect to each other increases (enhanced liquid behavior). Since neutral gas pressure in dusty plasma acts as inverse temperature, we argue that the structural changes observed with increasing pressure are analogous to a transition to a nematic liquid crystal state. It is further observed that the filaments exhibit alignment in nested surfaces for several pressure-current conditions, suggesting the possibility of a smectic liquid crystal state. These results are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of the dust and ions using the DRIAD (Dynamic Response of Ions And Dust) code.</description>

      <title>Counterpart-Induced Millisecond-Scale Truncation Mechanism of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed millisecond-scale duration is an essential yet mysterious feature of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this Letter, we link the observed soft gamma-ray counterpart of FRB 200428 to electron-positron pair cascades driven by Compton scattering and the Breit-Wheeler process. We demonstrate that such pair cascades can truncate FRBs to durations down to millisecond-scale, thereby establishing millisecond-scale upper bounds on their durations. The physical processes involved in the truncation mechanism occur during the propagation of FRBs after their production. Consequently, this mechanism is independent of the specific production mechanism or origin of the FRBs, suggesting that it could potentially operate in all FRBs. Our results lift the constraint on FRB production mechanisms that they must inherently generate bursts lasting only milliseconds.</description>

      <title>The SPARTA project: toward a demonstrator facility for multistage plasma acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma accelerators promise greatly reduced size and cost for future particle-accelerator facilities. However, several challenges remain to be solved; in particular that of coupling beams between plasma stages (i.e., staging) without beam-quality degradation, and that of ensuring a stable acceleration process. In order to mature the technology, it is also key to identify an application that requires staging and high stability but is not overly challenging in other parameters such as energy efficiency, beam quality and repetition rate. The goal of the ERC-funded project SPARTA is to solve the staging and stability problems of plasma acceleration, and to combine the solutions into a medium-scale multistage plasma-accelerator facility for such an application: experiments in strong-field quantum electrodynamics. Here, we discuss the three main objectives of the SPARTA project: developing a nonlinear plasma lens for staging, developing self-stabilization mechanisms, and providing a conceptual design for a multistage demonstrator facility.</description>

      <title>Frequency modulation of THz emission from a laser filament array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple traveling wave antenna model is used to theoretically study emission from an array of filaments. Both transverse and longitudinal arrays of filaments are considered. The angular distribution and power in the THz signal are significantly modified, which is consistent with other trends reported in the literature. The frequency content of the THz emission signal is also strongly modified under certain conditions. Whereas the emission from a single filament is broadband, the emission from a periodic transverse array consists of several discrete frequencies. For this latter case, the THz spectrum can be approximated as the product of two factors - the spectrum from a single filament and a complex frequency-dependent phase factor associated with the spatial distribution of the filaments. The complex phase factor accounts for interference effects, amplifying certain frequencies from the single filament spectrum while suppressing others. The location and width of the discrete frequencies present in the final spectrum depends on the number of filaments and their spacing. These results point to an interesting possibility of tailoring the frequency content in the THz signal.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of electron energy from laser wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Bayesian optimization in combination with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to determine the optimal laser and plasma parameters that, for a given laser pulse energy, maximize the cut-off energy of an electron beam produced by laser wakefield accelerators. We assume a Gaussian laser driver with matched spot size and amplitude and investigate both self-guiding in a uniform-density plasma and guiding in a preformed plasma channel with matched radius. To interpret the simulation results quantitatively, we derive novel analytical expressions for the maximum electron energy and the corresponding acceleration distance, accounting for the effects of laser diffraction and energy depletion. Based on the results obtained, we discuss the potential scalability of the optimal input (plasma density, pulse duration, amplitude, and spot size) and output (electron energy and acceleration length) parameters to laser systems of arbitrary energy.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Characterization of Intermittency in Relativistic Pair Plasma Turbulence: Single and Double Sheet Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of turbulence in magnetized plasmas remains an unresolved problem. The most poorly understood aspect is intermittency -- spatio-temporal fluctuations superimposed on the self-similar turbulent motions. We employ a novel machine-learning analysis technique to segment turbulent flow structures into distinct clusters based on statistical similarities across multiple physical features. We apply this technique to kinetic simulations of decaying (freely evolving) and driven (forced) turbulence in a strongly magnetized pair-plasma environment, and find that the previously identified intermittent fluctuations consist of two distinct clusters: i) current sheets, thin slabs of electric current between merging flux ropes, and; ii) double sheets, pairs of oppositely polarized current slabs, possibly generated by two non-linearly interacting Alfv\'en-wave packets. The distinction is crucial for the construction of realistic turbulence sub-grid models.</description>

      <title>Intermingled open and closed magnetic field lines near the radial origin of the heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.</description>
