      <title>Near Optimal Alphabet-Soundness Tradeoff PCPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for sufficiently large prime power $q$, for all $\delta&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to distinguish whether a 2-Prover-1-Round projection game with alphabet size $q$ has value at least $1-\delta$, or value at most $1/q^{(1-\epsilon)}$. This establishes a nearly optimal alphabet-to-soundness tradeoff for 2-query PCPs with alphabet size $q$, improving upon a result of [Chan 2016]. Our result has the following implications:
  1) Near optimal hardness for Quadratic Programming: it is NP-hard to approximate the value of a given Boolean Quadratic Program within factor $(\log n)^{(1 - o(1))}$ under quasi-polynomial time reductions. This result improves a result of [Khot-Safra 2013] and nearly matches the performance of the best known approximation algorithm [Megrestki 2001, Nemirovski-Roos-Terlaky 1999 Charikar-Wirth 2004] that achieves a factor of $O(\log n)$.
  2) Bounded degree 2-CSP's: under randomized reductions, for sufficiently large $d&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to approximate the value of 2-CSPs in which each variable appears in at most d constraints within factor $(1-o(1))d/2$ improving upon a recent result of [Lee-Manurangsi 2023].
  3) Improved hardness results for connectivity problems: using results of [Laekhanukit 2014] and [Manurangsi 2019], we deduce improved hardness results for the Rooted $k$-Connectivity Problem, the Vertex-Connectivity Survivable Network Design Problem and the Vertex-Connectivity $k$-Route Cut Problem.</description>

      <title>Lifting with Inner Functions of Polynomial Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifting theorems are theorems that bound the communication complexity of a composed function $f\circ g^{n}$ in terms of the query complexity of $f$ and the communication complexity of $g$. Such theorems constitute a powerful generalization of direct-sum theorems for $g$, and have seen numerous applications in recent years. We prove a new lifting theorem that works for every two functions $f,g$ such that the discrepancy of $g$ is at most inverse polynomial in the input length of $f$. Our result is a significant generalization of the known direct-sum theorem for discrepancy, and extends the range of inner functions $g$ for which lifting theorems hold.</description>

      <title>Diagram Analysis of Iterative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general class of first-order iterative algorithms which includes power iteration, belief propagation and Approximate Message Passing (AMP), and many forms of gradient descent. When the input is a random matrix with i.i.d. entries, we present a new way to analyze these algorithms using combinatorial diagrams. Each diagram is a small graph, and the operations of the algorithm correspond to simple combinatorial operations on these graphs.
  We prove a fundamental property of the diagrams: asymptotically, we can discard all of the diagrams except for the trees. The mechanics of first-order algorithms simplify dramatically as the algorithmic operations have particularly simple and interpretable effects on the trees. We further show that the tree-shaped diagrams are essentially a basis of asymptotically independent Gaussian vectors.
  The tree approximation mirrors the assumption of the cavity method, a 40-year-old non-rigorous technique in statistical physics which has served as one of the most fundamental techniques in the field. We demonstrate the connection with the replica symmetric cavity method by "implementing" heuristic physics derivations into rigorous proofs. We rigorously establish that belief propagation is asymptotically equal to its associated AMP algorithm and we give a new simple proof of the state evolution formula for AMP.
  These results apply when the iterative algorithm runs for constantly many iterations. We then push the diagram analysis to a number of iterations that scales with the dimension $n$ of the input matrix. We prove that for debiased power iteration, the tree diagram representation accurately describes the dynamic all the way up to $n^{\Omega(1)}$ iterations. We conjecture that this can be extended up to $n^{1/2}$ iterations but no further. Our proofs use straightforward combinatorial arguments akin to the trace method from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Trading Determinism for Noncommutativity in Edmonds' Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=X_1\sqcup X_2\sqcup\ldots\sqcup X_k$ be a partitioned set of variables such that the variables in each part $X_i$ are noncommuting but for any $i\neq j$, the variables $x\in X_i$ commute with the variables $x'\in X_j$. Given as input a square matrix $T$ whose entries are linear forms over $\mathbb{Q}\langle{X}\rangle$, we consider the problem of checking if $T$ is invertible or not over the universal skew field of fractions of the partially commutative polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}\langle{X}\rangle$ [Klep-Vinnikov-Volcic (2020)]. In this paper, we design a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem for constant $k$. The special case $k=1$ is the noncommutative Edmonds' problem (NSINGULAR) which has a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm by recent results [Garg-Gurvits-Oliveira-Wigderson (2016), Ivanyos-Qiao-Subrahmanyam (2018), Hamada-Hirai (2021)].
  En-route, we obtain the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the equivalence testing problem of $k$-tape \emph{weighted} automata (for constant $k$) resolving a long-standing open problem [Harju and Karhum"{a}ki(1991), Worrell (2013)]. Algebraically, the equivalence problem reduces to testing whether a partially commutative rational series over the partitioned set $X$ is zero or not [Worrell (2013)]. Decidability of this problem was established by Harju and Karhum\"{a}ki (1991). Prior to this work, a \emph{randomized} polynomial-time algorithm for this problem was given by Worrell (2013) and, subsequently, a deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithm was also developed [Arvind et al. (2021)].</description>

      <title>Topological entropy of Turing complete dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between Turing completeness and topological entropy of dynamical systems. We first prove that a natural class of Turing machines (which includes most of the examples of universal Turing machines) has positive topological entropy. We deduce that any Turing complete dynamics with a continuous encoding that simulates a universal machine in this class is chaotic. This applies to our previous constructions of Turing complete area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the disk and 3D stationary Euler flows.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms to simulate quadratic classical Hamiltonians and optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of realistic classical mechanical systems is of great importance to many areas of engineering such as robotics, dynamics of rotating machinery and control theory. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms to estimate quantities of interest such as the kinetic energy in a given classical mechanical system in the presence of friction or damping as well as forcing or source terms, which makes the algorithm of practical interest. We show that for such systems, the quantum algorithm scales polynomially with the logarithm of the dimension of the system. We cast this problem in terms of Hamilton's equations of motion (equivalent to the first variation of the Lagrangian) and solve them using quantum algorithms for differential equations. We then consider the hardness of estimating the kinetic energy of a damped coupled oscillator system. We show that estimating the kinetic energy at a given time of this system to within additive precision is BQP hard when the strength of the damping term is bounded by an inverse polynomial in the number of qubits. We then consider the problem of designing optimal control of classical systems, which can be cast as the second variation of the Lagrangian. In this direction, we first consider the Riccati equation, which is a nonlinear differential equation ubiquitous in control theory. We give an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the Riccati differential equation well into the nonlinear regime. To our knowledge, this is the first example of any nonlinear differential equation that can be solved when the strength of the nonlinearity is asymptotically greater than the amount of dissipation. We then show how to use this algorithm to solve the linear quadratic regulator problem, which is an example of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.</description>

      <title>An efficient uniqueness theorem for overcomplete tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new, constructive uniqueness theorem for tensor decomposition. It applies to order 3 tensors of format $n \times n \times p$ and can prove uniqueness of decomposition for generic tensors up to rank $r=4n/3$ as soon as $p \geq 4$. One major advantage over Kruskal's uniqueness theorem is that our theorem has an algorithmic proof, and the resulting algorithm is efficient. Like the uniqueness theorem, it applies in the range $n \leq r \leq 4n/3$. As a result, we obtain the first efficient algorithm for overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of order 3.
  For instance, prior to this work it was not known how to efficiently decompose generic tensors of format $n \times n \times n$ and rank $r=1.01n$ (or rank $r \leq (1+\epsilon) n$, for some constant $\epsilon &gt;0$). Efficient overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of format $n \times n \times 3$ remains an open problem.
  Our results are based on the method of commuting extensions pioneered by Strassen for the proof of his $3n/2$ lower bound on tensor rank and border rank. In particular, we rely on an algorithm for the computation of commuting extensions recently proposed in a companion paper, and on the classical diagonalization-based "Jennrich algorithm" for undercomplete tensor decomposition.</description>

      <title>Expansion of higher-dimensional cubical complexes with application to quantum locally testable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high-dimensional cubical complex, for any dimension t&gt;0, and apply it to the design of quantum locally testable codes. Our complex is a natural generalization of the constructions by Panteleev and Kalachev and by Dinur et. al of a square complex (case t=2), which have been applied to the design of classical locally testable codes (LTC) and quantum low-density parity check codes (qLDPC) respectively.
  We turn the geometric (cubical) complex into a chain complex by relying on constant-sized local codes $h_1,\ldots,h_t$ as gadgets. A recent result of Panteleev and Kalachev on existence of tuples of codes that are product expanding enables us to prove lower bounds on the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.
  For t=4 our construction gives a new family of "almost-good" quantum LTCs -- with constant relative rate, inverse-polylogarithmic relative distance and soundness, and constant-size parity checks. Both the distance of the quantum code and its local testability are proven directly from the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.</description>
