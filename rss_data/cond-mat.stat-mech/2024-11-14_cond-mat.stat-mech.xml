      <title>The $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain and the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model at $\theta = \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. In the Affleck-Haldane picture, an `extension field' parametrises the correlated fluctuations of the couplings and extends the target space from $S^2$ to $S^3$; recently, however, Zirnbauer has advanced a competing picture where the extension field is frozen out and the infrared theory is more naturally thought of as a compact free boson dual to $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$. We show that the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain evinces a phase transition between these pictures -- corresponding to whether the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint $O(4)$ N\'eel-singlet order parameter or appears as a separate gapped mode. For the $O(3)$ NLSM itself, this analysis supports the Zirnbauer picture.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling of Protein Conformational Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein function does not solely depend on structure but often relies on dynamical transitions between distinct conformations. Despite this fact, our ability to characterize or predict protein dynamics is substantially less developed compared to state-of-the-art protein structure prediction. Molecular simulations provide unique opportunities to study protein dynamics, but the timescales associated with conformational changes generate substantial challenges. Enhanced sampling algorithms with collective variables can greatly reduce the computational cost of sampling slow processes. However, defining collective variables suitable to enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions is non-trivial. Low-frequency vibrations have long been considered as promising candidates for collective variable but their identification so far relied on assumptions inherently invalid at low frequencies. We recently introduced an analysis of molecular vibrations that does not rely on such approximations and remains accurate at low frequencies. Here, we modified this approach to efficiently isolate low-frequency vibrations in proteins and applied it to a set of five proteins of varying complexity. We demonstrate that our approach is not only highly reproducible but results in collective variables that consistently enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions and associated free energy surfaces on timescales compatible with high throughput applications. This enables the efficient generation of protein conformational ensembles, which will be key for future prediction algorithms aiming beyond static protein structures.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the martingale property of entropy production in stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By decoupling forward and backward stochastic trajectories, we develop a family of martingales and work theorems for the same stochastic process. We achieve this by introducing an alternative work theorem derivation that uses tools from stochastic calculus instead of path integrals. Our derivation applies to both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics and generalizes work theorems so that they connect new quantities in stochastic processes, potentially revealing new applications in dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Single impurity in the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of a single impurity particle embedded within a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP). By analyzing the impurity's dynamics, characterized by two arbitrary hopping parameters $ \alpha $ and $\beta$, we investigate both its macroscopic impact on the system and its individual trajectory, providing new insights into the interaction between the impurity and the TASEP environment. We classify the induced hydrodynamic limit shapes based on the initial densities to the left and right of the impurity, along with the values of the parameters $\alpha$,$\beta$. We develop a new method that enables the analysis of the impurity's behavior within an arbitrary density field, thereby generalizing the traditional coupling technique used for second-class particles. With this tool, we extend to the impurity case under certain parameter conditions, Ferrari and Kipnis's results on the distribution of the asymptotic speed of a second-class particle within a rarefaction fan.</description>

      <title>On the foundations of statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although not as wide, and popular, as that of quantum mechanics, the investigation of fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics constitutes an important research field in the building of modern physics. Besides the interest for itself, both for physicists and philosophers, and the obvious pedagogical motivations, there is a further, compelling reason for a thorough understanding of the subject. The fast development of models and methods at the edge of the established domain of the field requires indeed a deep reflection on the essential aspects of the theory, which are at the basis of its success. These elements should never be disregarded when trying to expand the domain of statistical mechanics to systems with novel, little known features. It is thus important to (re)consider in a careful way the main ingredients involved in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Among those, a primary role is covered by the dynamical aspects (e.g. presence of chaos), the emergence of collective features for large systems, and the use of probability in the building of a consistent statistical description of physical systems. With this goal in mind, in the present review we aim at providing a consistent picture of the state of the art of the subject, both in the classical and in the quantum realm. In particular, we will highlight the similarities of the key technical and conceptual steps with emphasis on the relevance of the many degrees of freedom, to justify the use of statistical ensembles in the two domains.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of driven probes reveal nonequilibrium transitions in complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs exhibit nonequilibrium behaviors that remain poorly understood. To identify changes in the fluid's microstructural conformation, we introduce a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem for laser-trapped probes dragged at a mean constant speed. Specifically, we link the different scaling regimes in the probe's position variance, obtained through large-scale Brownian simulations of a polymeric fluid, to transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind recently measured nonlinear friction curves. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method to experimentally detect nonequilibrium transitions in fluids' structure.</description>

      <title>Typical Positivity of Nonequilibrium Entropy Production for Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the nonequilibrium dynamics of most pure states gives rise to the same entropy production as that of the corresponding ensemble, provided the effective dimension of the ensemble is large enough. This establishes the positivity of entropy production under a wide variety of nonequilibrium situations. Our results follow from dynamical typicality and suitable continuity properties alone, without relying on non-integrability, and they complement other recent efforts to establish "pure state second laws". An explicit comparison with the distinctively different two-point measurement scheme is also provided.</description>

      <title>Enzymatic Mpemba Effect: Slowing of biochemical reactions by increasing enzyme concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing the enzyme concentration generally speeds up enzymatic reactions. However, in this Letter, we show that increasing the enzyme concentration can also slow down the enzymatic reaction. We consider a simple allosteric protein with multiple modification sites, catalyzed by two enzymes with the same catalytic activity, but slightly different affinities. We show that increasing the concentration of one enzyme can slow the relaxation to the equilibrium state. The mechanism for this slowing is similar the Markovian Mpemba effect, and we name this phenomenon as the Enzymatic Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>h-CMD: An efficient hybrid fast centroid and quasi-centroid molecular dynamics method for the simulation of vibrational spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient path integral (PI) methods for atomistic simulations of vibrational spectra in heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces has long been a challenging task. Here, we present the h-CMD method, short for hybrid centroid molecular dynamics, that combines the recently introduced fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) method with fast CMD (f-CMD). In this scheme, molecules that are believed to suffer more seriously from the curvature problem of CMD, e.g., water, are treated with f-QCMD, while the rest, e.g., solid surfaces, are treated with f-CMD. To test the accuracy of the newly introduced scheme, the infrared spectra of the interfacial D2O confined in the archetypal ZIF-90 framework are simulated using h-CMD compared to a variety of other PI methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and partially adiabatic CMD as well as f-CMD and experiment as reference. Comparisons are also made to classical MD, where nuclear quantum effects are neglected entirely. Our detailed comparisons at different temperatures of 250-600 K show that h-CMD produces O-D stretches that are in close agreement with the experiment, correcting the known curvature problem and red-shifting of the stretch peaks of CMD. h-CMD also corrects the known issues associated with too artificially dampened and broadened spectra of T-RPMD, which leads to missing the characteristic doublet feature of the interfacial confined water, rendering it unsuitable for these systems. The new h-CMD method broadens the applicability of f-QCMD to heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, where defining curvilinear coordinates for the entire system is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Two types of quantum chaos: testing the limits of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two types of quantum chaos: eigenbasis chaos and spectral chaos. The first type controls the early-time physics, e.g. the thermal relaxation and the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. It can be traced back to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), a statistical hypothesis about the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. The second type concerns very late-time physics, e.g. the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. It can be traced back to Random Matrix Universality (RMU), a statistical hypothesis about the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture asserts a direct relationship between the two types of chaos for quantum systems with a chaotic semiclassical limit. The BGS conjecture is challenged by the Poissonian Hamiltonian ensembles, which can be used to model any quantum system displaying RMU. In this paper, we start by analyzing further aspects of such ensembles. On general and numerical grounds, we argue that these ensembles can have chaotic semiclassical limits. We then study the Poissonian ensemble associated with the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. While the distribution of couplings peaks around the original SYK model, the Poissonian ensemble is not $k$-local. This suggests that the link between ETH and RMU requires of physical $k$-locality as an assumption. We test this hypothesis by modifying the couplings of the SYK Hamiltonian via the Metropolis algorithm, rewarding directions in the space of couplings that do not display RMU. The numerics converge to a $k$-local Hamiltonian with eigenbasis chaos but without spectral chaos. We finally comment on ways out and corollaries of our results.</description>

      <title>The role of correlations in a sequence of quantum observations on empirical measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outcome of continuously measuring a quantum system is a string of data whose intricate correlation properties reflect the underlying quantum dynamics. In this paper we study the role of these correlation in reconstructing the probabilities of finite sequences of outcomes, the so-called empirical distributions. Our approach is cast in terms of generic quantum instruments, and therefore encompass all types of sequential and continuous quantum measurements. We also show how this specializes to important cases, such as quantum jumps. To quantify the precise role of correlations, we introduce a relative-entropy based measure that quantifies the range of correlations in the string, and the influence that these correlations have in reconstructing finite sequences.</description>

      <title>Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugei-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</description>

      <title>From noisy cell size control to population growth: when variability can be beneficial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell experiments revealed substantial variability in generation times, growth rates but also in birth and division sizes between genetically identical cells. Understanding how these fluctuations determine the fitness of the population, i.e. its growth rate, is necessary in any quantitative theory of evolution. Here, we develop a biologically-relevant model which accounts for the stochasticity in single-cell growth rates, birth sizes and division sizes. We derive expressions for the population growth rate and for the mean birth size in the population in terms of the single-cell fluctuations. Allowing division sizes to fluctuate reveals how the mechanism of cell size control (timer, sizer, adder) influences population growth. Surprisingly, we find that fluctuations in single-cell growth rates can be beneficial for population growth when slow-growing cells tend to divide at smaller sizes than fast-growing cells. Our framework is not limited to exponentially-growing cells like $\textit{Escherichia coli}$, and we derive similar expressions for cells with linear and bi-linear growth laws, such as $\textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}$ and fission yeast $\textit{Schizosaccharomyces pombe}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the numerical integration of the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical force and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory aims to find an optimal protocol to steer a system between assigned boundary conditions while minimizing a given cost functional in finite time. Equations arising from these types of problems are often non-linear and difficult to solve numerically. In this note, we describe numerical methods of integration for two partial differential equations that commonly arise in optimal control theory: the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical potential for which we use Girsanov theorem; and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, or dynamic programming, equation for which we find the gradient of its solution using the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application in solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization by machine learning.</description>

      <title>Inferring Parameter Distributions in Heterogeneous Motile Particle Ensembles: A Likelihood Approach for Second Order Langevin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of biological agents often leads to motility behavior that appears to have random components. Robust stochastic inference methods are therefore required to understand and predict the motion patterns from time discrete trajectory data provided by experiments. In many cases second order Langevin models are needed to adequately capture the motility. Additionally, population heterogeneity needs to be taken into account when analyzing data from several individual organisms. In this work, we describe a maximum likelihood approach to infer dynamical, stochastic models and, simultaneously, estimate the heterogeneity in a population of motile active particles from discretely sampled, stochastic trajectories. To this end we propose a new method to approximate the likelihood for non-linear second order Langevin models. We show that this maximum likelihood ansatz outperforms alternative approaches especially for short trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate how a measure of uncertainty for the heterogeneity estimate can be derived. We thereby pave the way for the systematic, data-driven inference of dynamical models for actively driven entities based on trajectory data, deciphering temporal fluctuations and inter-particle variability.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in a constrained two-qubit quantum control landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimal quantum control, control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) indicate sharp changes occurring in the set of optimal protocols, as a physical model parameter is varied. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a new class of CLPTs, associated with changes in the topological properties of the optimal level set in a two-qubit state-preparation problem. In particular, the distance distribution of control protocols sampled through stochastic homotopic dynamics reveals discontinuous changes in the number of connected components in the optimal level set, as a function of the protocol duration. We demonstrate how topological CLPTs can be detected in modern-day experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon that affects the fate of chaotic quantum many-body dynamics. Here, we show that chaos can be robust against dissipation but can also assist and anomalously enhance relaxation. We compute exactly the dissipative form factor of a generic Floquet quantum circuit with arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels and find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is ``assisted'' by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we prove that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit. We complement our analytical findings with numerical results for quantum qubit circuits.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this letter, we consider collective search costs that do not only account for the search time but also for the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. First a general formalism is presented for independent agents in terms of the target survival probability for a single-agent search, where agents are allowed to be launched at arbitrary times. With this, the optimal number of searchers to be launched simultaneously at the initial time is analytically derived. Then, the optimal times at which later agents should be launched are calculated for different classes of the single-agent survival probabilities demonstrating how short- and long-time behaviors impact the optimal strategies. Finally the costs for launching new searchers are compared with those for resetting a single one.</description>

      <title>Finite-time thermodynamic bounds and tradeoff relations for information processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In thermal environments, information processing requires thermodynamic costs determined by the second law of thermodynamics. Information processing within finite time is particularly important, since fast information processing has practical significance but is inevitably accompanied by additional dissipation. In this paper, we reveal the fundamental thermodynamic costs and the tradeoff relations between incompatible information processing such as measurement and feedback in the finite-time regime. To this end, we introduce a general framework based on the concept of the Pareto front for thermodynamic costs, revealing the existence of fundamental tradeoff relations between them. Focusing on discrete Markov jump processes, we consider the tradeoff relation between thermodynamic activities, which in turn determines the tradeoff relation between entropy productions. To identify the Pareto fronts, we introduce a new Wasserstein distance that captures the thermodynamic costs of subsystems, providing a geometrical perspective on their structure. Our framework enables us to find the optimal entropy production of subsystems and the optimal time evolution to realize it. In an illustrative example, we find that even in situations where naive optimization of total dissipation cannot realize the function of Maxwell's demon, reduction of the dissipation in the feedback system according to the tradeoff relation enables the realization of the demon. We also show that an optimal Maxwell's demon can be implemented by using double quantum dots. Furthermore, our framework is applicable to larger scale systems with multiple states, as demonstrated by a model of chemotaxis. Our results would serve as a designing principle of efficient thermodynamic machines performing information processing, from single electron devices to biochemical signal transduction.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have attracted growing attention due to the emergence of intriguing phenomena that are absent in equilibrium physics. In this letter, we identify a new class of Floquet criticality characterized by nontrivial topology. For generic driven Majorana fermion chains with chiral symmetry, we analytically demonstrate that Floquet driving can enrich the transition point, resulting in topologically distinct quantum critical lines that are absent in undriven systems. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical explanation for the underlying mechanism of the nontrivial topology at Floquet criticality and generalize our results to higher dimensions. This work not only extends the scope of topological physics in Floquet systems but also deepens our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Exact Fractional Inference via Re-Parametrization &amp; Interpolation between Tree-Re-Weighted- and Belief Propagation- Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the partition function, $Z$, of an Ising model over a graph of $N$ \enquote{spins} is most likely exponential in $N$. Efficient variational methods, such as Belief Propagation (BP) and Tree Re-Weighted (TRW) algorithms, compute $Z$ approximately by minimizing the respective (BP- or TRW-) free energy. We generalize the variational scheme by building a $\lambda$-fractional interpolation, $Z^{(\lambda)}$, where $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$ correspond to TRW- and BP-approximations, respectively. This fractional scheme -- coined Fractional Belief Propagation (FBP) -- guarantees that in the attractive (ferromagnetic) case $Z^{(TRW)} \geq Z^{(\lambda)} \geq Z^{(BP)}$, and there exists a unique (\enquote{exact}) $\lambda_*$ such that $Z=Z^{(\lambda_*)}$. Generalizing the re-parametrization approach of \citep{wainwright_tree-based_2002} and the loop series approach of \citep{chertkov_loop_2006}, we show how to express $Z$ as a product, $\forall \lambda:\ Z=Z^{(\lambda)}{\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, where the multiplicative correction, ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, is an expectation over a node-independent probability distribution built from node-wise fractional marginals. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive experiments with models from Ising ensembles over planar and random graphs of medium and large sizes. Our empirical study yields a number of interesting observations, such as the ability to estimate ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$ with $O(N^{2::4})$ fractional samples and suppression of variation in $\lambda_*$ estimates with an increase in $N$ for instances from a particular random Ising ensemble, where $[2::4]$ indicates a range from $2$ to $4$. We also discuss the applicability of this approach to the problem of image de-noising.</description>

      <title>First Principles Numerical Demonstration of Emergent Decoherent Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the histories formalism the decoherence functional is a formal tool to investigate the emergence of classicality in isolated quantum systems, yet an explicit evaluation of it from first principles has not been reported. We provide such an evaluation for up to five-time histories based on exact numerical diagonalization of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find a robust emergence of decoherence for slow and coarse observables of a generic random matrix model and extract a finite size scaling law by varying the Hilbert space dimension over four orders of magnitude. Specifically, we conjecture and observe an exponential suppression of coherent effects as a function of the particle number of the system. This suggests a solution to the preferred basis problem of the many worlds interpretation (or the set selection problem of the histories formalism) within a minimal theoretical framework -- without relying on environmentally induced decoherence, quantum Darwinism, Markov approximations, low-entropy initial states or ensemble averages.</description>

      <title>Comparison of gap-based and flow-based control strategies using a new controlled stochastic cellular automaton model for traffic flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are essential to future transportation systems, potentially reducing traffic congestion. This study examines the impact of different vehicle control strategies on traffic flow through simulations. We propose a novel stochastic cellular automaton model, the controlled stochastic optimal velocity (CSOV) model, which incorporates vehicle control effects. Within the CSOV model, two control strategies are implemented: gap-based control (GC), which adjusts vehicle velocity to balance the gaps between adjacent vehicles, and flow-based control (FC), which aims to maintain a consistent local flow between the front and rear vehicles. Results show that both control strategies improve traffic flow. However, under weaker control, the GC sometimes resulted in lower flow compared to no control. In contrast, the FC consistently enhanced flow across control strengths, yielding more robust outcomes. Furthermore, when both strategies achieved comparable flow rates, the FC provided a more stable velocity distribution under varying traffic densities than the GC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between tagged particles and size-biased empirical processes in interacting particle systems, in analogy to classical results on the propagation of chaos. In a mean-field scaling limit, the evolution of the occupation number on the tagged particle site converges to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process with non-linear master equation given by the law of large numbers of size-biased empirical measures. The latter are important in recent efforts to understand the dynamics of condensation in interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Multifractal phase in the weighted adjacency matrices of random Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix in the giant connected component of Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, with average connectivity $p$ and randomly distributed hopping amplitudes. By solving the self-consistent cavity equations satisfied by the matrix elements of the resolvent, we compute the probability distribution of the local density of states, which governs the scaling with the system size of the moments of the eigenvectors' amplitudes, as well as several other observables related to the spectral statistics. For small values of $p&gt;1$ above the percolation threshold, we unveil the presence of an exotic delocalized but (weakly) multifractal phase in a broad region of the parameter space, which separates the localized phase found for $p\le1$ from the fully-delocalized GOE-like phase expected for $p\to \infty$. We explore the fundamental physical mechanism underlying the emergence of delocalized multifractal states, rooted in the pronounced heterogeneity in the topology of the graph. This heterogeneity arises from the interplay between strong fluctuations in local degrees and hopping amplitudes, and leads to an effective fragmentation of the graph. We further support our findings by characterizing the level statistics and the two-point spatial correlations within the multifractal phase, and address the ensuing anomalous transport and relaxation properties affecting the quantum dynamical evolution.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new diagnostics of the transition between the ergodic and many-body localization phases, which are based on complexity measures defined via the probability distribution function of the Lanczos coefficients of the tri-diagonalized Hamiltonian. We use these complexity measures to analyze the power-law random banded matrix model as a function of the correlation strength and show that the moments and the entropy of the distribution diagnose the ergodic to many-body transition, as well as the distinctive feature of the phases concerning the memory of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The Griffiths phase and beyond: A large deviations study of the magnetic susceptibility of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare, long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.</description>

Abstract: World-wide efforts aim at the realization of advanced quantum simulators and processors. However, despite the development of intricate hardware and pulse control systems, it may still not be generally known which effective quantum dynamics, or channels, are implemented on these devices. To systematically infer those, we propose a neural-network algorithm approximating generic discrete-time dynamics through the repeated action of an effective quantum channel. We test our approach considering time-periodic Lindblad dynamics as well as non-unitary subsystem dynamics in many-body unitary circuits. Moreover, we exploit it to investigate cross-talk effects on the ibmq_ehningen quantum processor, which showcases our method as a practically applicable tool for inferring quantum channels when the exact nature of the underlying dynamics on the physical device is not known a priori. While the present approach is tailored for learning Markovian dynamics, we discuss how it can be adapted to also capture generic non-Markovian discrete-time evolutions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and further clarifies why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without further training. Our theory reveals that for single-instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed analytically tractable model thus offers a promising avenue for thinking about how to interpret many intriguing but puzzling properties of large language models.</description>
