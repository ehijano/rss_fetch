      <title>Impact of a Fano resonance on the measured transition time scale in solid state photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental quantum transition time scales are accessible through the spin polarization of photoelectrons coming from initially spin-degenerate states for solid-state materials . In this work we investigate the modification of this time scale in the vicinity of a Fano resonance in photoemission from a solid. We employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) to study the valence band of 1T-TiSe$_2$ and 1T-TiTe$_2$, with an excitation photon energy coinciding with the Ti 3p-3d autoionization state. The energy derivative of the measured spin polarization, which is in the off-resonance case proportional to the transition time, reveals a sign reversal and significant magnitude decrease compared to off-resonance measurements. We show that this effect goes beyond conventional semi-analytical models used to translate spin polarization to the EWS time delay. At the Fano resonance, the underlying interference assumption of the model breaks down, and additional information about resonance strength is needed to extract the transition time delays.</description>

      <title>Field-programmable dynamics in a soft magnetic actuator enabling true random number generation and reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex and even chaotic dynamics, though prevalent in many natural and engineered systems, has been largely avoided in the design of electromechanical systems due to concerns about wear and controlability. Here, we demonstrate that complex dynamics might be particularly advantageous in soft robotics, offering new functionalities beyond motion not easily achievable with traditional actuation methods. We designed and realized resilient magnetic soft actuators capable of operating in a tunable dynamic regime for tens of thousands cycles without fatigue. We experimentally demonstrated the application of these actuators for true random number generation and stochastic computing. {W}e validate soft robots as physical reservoirs capable of performing Mackey--Glass time series prediction. These findings show that exploring the complex dynamics in soft robotics would extend the application scenarios in soft computing, human-robot interaction and collaborative robots as we demonstrate with biomimetic blinking and randomized voice modulation.</description>

      <title>Controlling Dissipative Topology Through Floquet Driving: From Transient Diagnostics to Boundary States Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.</description>

      <title>Inhibited radiative decay enhances single-photon emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks and the modular scaling of quantum computers require efficient spin-photon interfaces. This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Random purification channel made simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</description>

      <title>Schwinger effect with backreaction in 1+1D massive QED with a strong external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a strong electric field, the vacuum is unstable to the production of pairs of charged particles -- the Schwinger effect. The created pairs extract energy from the electric field, resulting in nontrivial backreaction. In this paper, we study 1+1D massive QED subject to strong external electric fields in a self-consistent and fully quantum manner. We use the bosonized version of the theory, which attains a cosine interaction term in the presence of nonzero fermion mass $m$. However, the assumption of strong electric field justifies a perturbative treatment of the cosine interaction, i.e., an expansion in $m$. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the electric field to first order in $m$ and show that -- surprisingly -- it satisfies a classical nonlinear partial differential equation (related to the sine-Gordon equation). We show that the electric field exhibits dissipation-free oscillations (analogous to ordinary plasma oscillations) and calculate the plasma frequency analytically. We also compare to the semiclassical approximation commonly used to study backreaction, showing that it fails to capture the $O(m)$ shift in the plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.</description>
