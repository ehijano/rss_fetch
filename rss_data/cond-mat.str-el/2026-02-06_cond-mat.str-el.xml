      <title>Graph--Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate pair-density-wave correlations in two-leg ladder $t$--$J$--$J_\perp$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a generalized Luther-Emery liquid phase characterized by incommensurate pair-density-wave (iC-PDW) correlations in the two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ ladder model. By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Information, Dissipation, and Planckian Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the efficiency with which "dissipated" work can generate distinguishable changes in a quantum many-body state at a finite temperature, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information. The bound follows solely from the analytic structure of equilibrium many-body correlators and is independent of all microscopic details. It takes a frequency-resolved form with a characteristic crossover at the Planckian scale, $\omega_\star\sim k_B T/\hbar$. We find that Planckian scatterers sit at the edge of optimality, displaying maximal relaxation rate before information-dissipation efficiency collapses. This suggests strange metals are not just fast dissipators, but the fastest that remain efficient in generating distinguishability. The bounded quantity can be evaluated directly from optical conductivity measurements in strongly correlated electronic systems, offering a unique window into how dissipation generates distinguishable changes.</description>

      <title>lrux: Fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lrux, a JAX-based software package for fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians, targeting the dominant computational bottleneck in various quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms. The package implements efficient low-rank updates that reduce the cost of successive wavefunction evaluations from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$ when the update rank $k$ is smaller than the dimension $n$ of matrices. Both determinant and Pfaffian updates are supported, together with delayed-update strategies that trade floating-point operations for reduced memory traffic on modern accelerators. lrux natively integrates with JAX transformations such as JIT compilation, vectorization, and automatic differentiation, and supports both real and complex data types. Benchmarks on GPUs demonstrate up to $1000\times$ speedup at large matrix sizes. lrux enables scalable, high-performance evaluation of antisymmetric wavefunctions and is designed as a drop-in component for a wide range of QMC workflows. lrux is available at https://github.com/ChenAo-Phys/lrux.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation via magnetic skyrmion, bimeron, and meron crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Evidence of Competing Diagonal Spin Interactions and Spin Disproportionation in the Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive spectroscopic map of the electronic, magnetic, and lattice excitations is presented for the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using Raman scattering at ambient pressure. Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations. Collectively, these findings identify a ground state of the bilayer nickelate characterized by competing bond-diagonal interactions, spin disproportionation, and an incipient lattice instability, establishing key ingredients for understanding the mechanism of nickelate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of an exceptionally large phonon thermal Hall effect from charge puddles in a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of a drastically enhanced thermal Hall effect in the topological insulator material TlBi$_{0.15}$Sb$_{0.85}$Te$_2$. Although heat transport is dominated by phonons, moderate magnetic fields generate a thermal Hall ratio ($\kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx}$) above 2\%, an unprecedented value for a nonmagnetic material. The transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ exhibits a pronounced maximum in fields of a few Tesla. This characteristic field dependence allows us to identify the microscopic origin of the thermal Hall effect in this system. Small densities of charged impurities induce locally conducting regions, so-called charge puddles, within the bulk insulating matrix. Via electron-phonon coupling, these charge puddles imprint a large thermal Hall effect onto the phonons accounting for both the magnitude and the magnetic-field dependence of the observed effect.</description>

      <title>A steady-state study of the nonequilibrium properties of realistic materials: Application of the mixed-configuration approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the mixed-configuration approximation (MCA) based on the auxiliary master equation approach impurity solver to study multiorbital correlated systems under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Suppressed coarsening after an interaction quench in the Holstein chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by an interaction quench in the semiclassical Holstein model within the Ehrenfest nonadiabatic framework, which describes an isolated hybrid quantum-classical system with strictly conserved total energy. Focusing on the half-filled case, where the equilibrium ground state exhibits commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) order for any nonzero coupling, we identify three distinct post-quench dynamical regimes as a function of the final electron-phonon coupling: a nonequilibrium metallic state without CDW order, an intermediate regime characterized by slow scale-invariant ordering dynamics, and a frozen CDW state with arrested coarsening and immobile kinks. We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation. An effective reaction-diffusion description, incorporating both annihilation and elastic scattering of kinks, quantitatively accounts for the observed scaling behavior. Our results reveal a distinct coarsening mechanism in isolated hybrid systems, demonstrating how internal quantum dynamics can qualitatively reshape defect kinetics far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Topological piezomagnetic effect in two-dimensional Dirac quadrupole altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets provide a natural platform for studying and exploiting piezomagnetism. In this paper, we introduce a class of insulating altermagnets in two dimensions (2D) referred to as Dirac quadrupole altermagnets, and show based on microscopic minimal models that the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of such altermagnets has a topological contribution described by topological response theory. The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear N\'eel order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed.</description>

      <title>Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Krylov complexity through quantum walks: An exploration of the quantum origins of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.</description>

      <title>Topological frustration and quantum resources</title>

Abstract: Although in general boundary conditions do not affect the bulk properties of a system, some of them are special and defy such expectation. This is the case, for instance, of those inducing geometrical frustration in a classical magnet. Recently, the study of such settings in quantum systems (dubbed topological frustration) has uncovered peculiar features, interesting both from a fundamental and technological point of view. In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation. Remarkably, this contribution can be calculated analytically, due to its similarities with that of a W-state.</description>

      <title>Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) give rise to novel dynamical states of quantum matter realized by balancing unitary evolution and measurements. We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Superconducting Gap of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatially-resolved laser-based high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements have been performed on the optimally-doped HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) superconductor with a $T_c$ at 133 K. Two distinct regions are identified on the cleaved surface: the single Fermi surface region where only one Fermi surface is observed, and the double Fermi surface region where two Fermi surface sheets are resolved coming from both the inner (IP) and outer (OP) CuO$_2$ planes. The electronic structure and superconducting gap are measured on both of these two regions. In both cases, the observed electronic states are mainly concentrated near the nodal region. The momentum dependence of superconducting gap deviates from the standard d-wave form. These results indicate that the surface electronic structure of Hg1223 behaves more like that of underdoped cuprates.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible $\sim 10^6$ graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided in a repository. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the antiferromagnetic S=1/2 chain and triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.</description>

      <title>Detecting underlying symmetry-protected topological phases via strange correlators and edge engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast majority of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states are difficult to detect, which often leads to their misidentification as ordinary or topologically trivial phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for detecting these hidden topological states. We distinguish the ordinary matter state from the topological phase by exploiting the boundary effects in space (via surface behaviors on engineered edge) and time (via strange correlators) according to the principle of bulk-edge correspondence. As a concrete example, we study the dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on its paramagnetic dimer phase and edge states. The dimer phase has been widely regarded as topologically trivial due to its gapped edge state on conventional edges. However, the model can also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual ladders, which suggests an SPT state adiabatically connected to the one-dimensional Haldane phase. We resolve this puzzle and demonstrate that the dimer phase is indeed a quasi-one-dimensional SPT state by measuring generalized strange correlators introduced in this work and by showing that the nontrivial gapless edge state on a zigzag edge is ferromagnetically ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate spinons liberated on each side of the cut. Furthermore, we show that the ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping. Overall, we establish a standard detection method for uncovering topological phases that masquerade as ordinary states of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the crystal-field splitting, ground-state Kramers doublet and intersite exchange interactions within the ground-state doublet manifold using an ab initio Hubbard-I based approach for a representative set of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds. These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions, and cation ordering can lead to exotic magnetic states in transition-metal ions. We report a comprehensive study of the Re-based (5$d^1$) ordered double perovskite oxide Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD reveals that Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) at low temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition below $\sim$13 K, with $M$--$H$ loops showing ferromagnetic-like hysteresis and an unusually high coercive field of 23 kOe at 2 K. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements detect static and spatially disordered internal fields below $T_M \simeq $ 12 K, consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic ground state determined by detailed DFT and force-theorem in Hubbard-I calculations. The reduced high-temperature effective moment ($\sim0.76~\mu_B$) and very small static moment ($\lesssim 0.2~\mu_B$) derived from $\mu$SR analysis and local-field simulations indicate a decisive role of spin-orbit coupling. Through a combined experimental and computational approach we unambiguously determine the canted antiferromagnetic order in Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$, showing that a very small ordered moment coexists with an exceptionally large coercivity. These results underscore the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and orbital ordering, providing new insights into magnetism in 5$d^1$ double perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for calculating exciton spectra and wavefunctions for model lattice Hamiltonians, based on real-space electron-hole propagators. We verify that our results agree with those of the continuum approximation in the limit of large Wannier excitons, and propose a simple criterion to estimate the exciton size above which the continuum approximation is quantitatively accurate. We then investigate simple one- and two-dimensional multi-orbital lattice models and show that small, Frenkel-like excitons, whose size approaches the lattice constant, can display physics that disagrees with the simplest continuum descriptions (a single-valley quadratic expansion around the minimum gap) not just quantitatively, but qualitatively. Specifically, we identify sharp transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton, enabled by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models.</description>

      <title>Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Chan et al., Nature Physics 10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. The results from the $\text{FL}^*$ phase show good consistency with current experimental data. Conversely, the results for the SDW phase are highly sensitive to the ordering momentum along the $z$-direction. An ordering vector of $Q = (\pi, \pi, \pi)$ yields predictions that starkly disagree with the experiment. The only possibility for agreement within the SDW scenario is to assume an ordering momentum of $Q = (\pi, \pi, 0)$. However, even in this specific case, the SDW scenario predicts a marginally smaller Yamaji angle at $\phi=0$ than the FL* theory, and a second Yamaji peak near in-plane angle $\phi = 45^\circ$, which was not observed in the experiment. In reality, the N\'eel ordering vector is likely uncorrelated between adjacent layers, so that there is no coherent interlayer transport of hole-pocket quasiparticles in the SDW scenario, and consequently no Yamaji effect. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Chiral gapped states are universally non-topological</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an operator generalization of the Li-Haldane conjecture regarding the entanglement Hamiltonian of a disk in a 2+1D chiral gapped groundstate. The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\mathfrak{c}_{\text{tot}})_{\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory. Our formalism also gives an explanation of the modular commutator formula for the chiral central charge.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries and mixed anomalies from conserved current construction in (3+1)D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a current-based construction of generalized symmetries in $(3+1)$D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), focusing on intrinsically non-invertible higher-form symmetries and their mixed anomalies. Starting from the equations of motion, we extract conserved currents and exponentiate the corresponding charges to obtain topological symmetry operators. This gives a step-by-step procedure for constructing symmetry operators, fusion, and anomaly diagnostics directly from the continuum action. We focus on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a\wedge a\wedge b$ twist, where $a$'s and $b$ are 1-form and 2-form gauge fields, respectively. These theories realize non-Abelian $(3+1)$D TQFTs supporting Borromean-rings braiding and describe three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in condensed matter. For $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, a microscopic realization is given by the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double model. Two distinct classes of conserved currents emerge: Type-I currents generate invertible higher-form symmetries with group-like fusion, while Type-II currents require additional consistency conditions on gauge-field configurations, leading to intrinsically non-invertible symmetries dressed by projectors. We compute the fusion algebra: invertible operators admit inverses, while non-invertible ones exhibit multi-channel fusion governed by projector fusion. We diagnose mixed anomalies by coupling multiple conserved currents to background gauge fields, revealing two outcomes: anomalies canceled by anomaly inflow from a higher-dimensional theory, and intrinsic gauging obstructions encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum theory. Overall, our results provide a unified and practical approach for constructing and characterizing higher-form symmetries, which can be extended to more general TQFTs and topological orders.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator in 6R-TaS$_2$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realizations of the simultaneous microscopic observation of interaction-driven charge order and genuine Mott localization, which are the defining hallmarks of a Wigner-Mott insulator, have remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating state in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge-ordered superstructure at one-third filling hosts a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. The spontaneous relaxation from excited states back to the ground state demonstrates that this Wigner-Mott phase is stabilized by the cooperative effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. Our results provide direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism and establish 6R-TaS$_2$ as a platform for the controlled realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Response of a Half-Filled Chern Band near Topological Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate electromagnetic-response observables in a half-filled Chern band, across a topological phase transition between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a Fermi liquid (FL) phase. While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a renormalization group flow with emergent supersymmetry in two dimensions from a non-Lagrangian theory. The ultraviolet theory does not have supersymmetry while the infrared theory does. We constrain the flow both analytically and numerically (truncated conformal space approach). Analytic constraints include a new spin constraint.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum speedups for near-term molecular electronic structure methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum non-orthogonal multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements between reference states. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of ansatz that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: linear combinations of orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and linear combinations of states prepared by generalized UCCSD circuits of polynomial depth, for which computing the expectation values of local fermionic observables up to a constant additive error is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. We discuss the implications for achieving practical quantum advantage in resolving the electronic structure of catalytic systems composed from multivalent transition metal atoms using near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Dissipative phase transition of interacting non-reciprocal fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While non-reciprocal couplings are ubiquitous in classical systems, their impact on quantum many-body criticality and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Using exact numerical simulations, we study an interacting fermionic chain subject to non-reciprocal gain and loss. We show that the interplay between dissipation and interactions drives a dissipative phase transition, marked by the opening of a many-body gap and a crossover from power-law to exponential relaxation. The weakly-interacting regime displays non-reciprocal signatures, including nonzero currents and directional charge accumulation reminiscent of the skin effect. Notably, despite this localization, quantum trajectories exhibit volume-law entanglement. Finally, reciprocity is dynamically restored above a critical interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of microstructured devices of the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn5 for investigations of isolated grain boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grain boundaries are critical for determining the functionality of polycrystalline materials. Here we present on the structural $\&amp;$ transport properties of grain boundaries in the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We provide a detailed recipe for the fabrication of isolated grain boundary devices from of as-grown polycrystalline samples of CeCoIn$_5$. Electron backscattered diffraction imaging of polycrystalline CeCoIn$_5$ samples reveals an abundance of $90^\circ$ misorientation grain boundaries suggesting a preferential nucleation of CeCoIn$_5$ grains with 90$^\circ$ misorientation over a random distribution of grain orientations. Transport measurements across grain boundary devices establish coherence of superconductivity and allows us to establish a lower bound on the critical current density for the grain boundaries. Our work opens new possibilities for fabrication of quantum devices such as Josephson-junctions out of bulk unconventional superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilization and effect of A-site ionic size in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has sparked a surge of research into Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates. Currently, stabilizing the bilayer RP phases with smaller $A$-site ions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Single-site dissipation stabilizes a superconducting nonequilibrium steady state in a strongly correlated system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can superconducting order be engineered as a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated systems? We demonstrate this possibility by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle-hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, specifically a locally transformed $\eta$-pair lowering operator, on a single lattice site only, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) exhibiting macroscopic $\eta$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization stands in stark contrast to schemes reliant on spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a single local dissipative seed suffices to establish long-range coherence across the entire interacting lattice system. We elucidate the underlying mechanism via three core features: local dark-state selection, the controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we systematically classify the stability of this NESS with respect to static disorder, and identify a wide regime in which the superconducting attractor remains robust against Hamiltonian perturbations that preserve the effective subspace structure. We also pinpoint specific perturbations that directly cause dephasing of the $% \eta$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. These findings open up a disorder-tolerant pathway for stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor through minimal local quantum-jump control.</description>
