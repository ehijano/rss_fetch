      <title>Diffusion-based Models for Unpaired Super-resolution in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-resolution numerical simulations are crucial for studying complex multiscale phenomena in fluid dynamics, such as turbulent flows and ocean waves. However, direct numerical simulations with high-resolution solvers are computationally prohibitive. As an alternative, super-resolution techniques enable the enhancement of low-fidelity, low-resolution simulations. However, traditional super-resolution approaches rely on paired low-fidelity, low-resolution and high-fidelity, high-resolution datasets for training, which are often impossible to acquire in complex flow systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-step approach that eliminates the need for paired datasets. First, we perform unpaired domain translation at the low-resolution level using an Enhanced Denoising Diffusion Implicit Bridge. This process transforms low-fidelity, low-resolution inputs into high-fidelity, low-resolution outputs, and we provide a theoretical analysis to highlight the advantages of this enhanced diffusion-based approach. Second, we employ the cascaded Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement model to upscale the high-fidelity, low-resolution prediction to the high-resolution result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across three fluid dynamics problems. Moreover, by incorporating a neural operator to learn system dynamics, our method can be extended to improve evolutionary simulations of low-fidelity, low-resolution data.</description>

      <title>Neural network-enhanced integrators for simulating ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous applications necessitate the computation of numerical solutions to differential equations across a wide range of initial conditions and system parameters, which feeds the demand for efficient yet accurate numerical integration methods.This study proposes a neural network (NN) enhancement of classical numerical integrators. NNs are trained to learn integration errors, which are then used as additive correction terms in numerical schemes. The performance of these enhanced integrators is compared with well-established methods through numerical studies, with a particular emphasis on computational efficiency. Analytical properties are examined in terms of local errors and backward error analysis. Embedded Runge-Kutta schemes are then employed to develop enhanced integrators that mitigate generalization risk, ensuring that the neural network's evaluation in previously unseen regions of the state space does not destabilize the integrator. It is guaranteed that the enhanced integrators perform at least as well as the desired classical Runge-Kutta schemes. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies using a realistic model of a wind turbine, with parameters derived from the established simulation framework OpenFast.</description>

      <title>Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low Equations: Eigensystem Analysis and Applications to One-Dimensional Test Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low (CGL) equations describe one of the simplest plasma flow models that allow anisotropic pressure, i.e., pressure is modeled using a symmetric tensor described by two scalar pressure components, one parallel to the magnetic field, another perpendicular to the magnetic field. The system of equations is a non-conservative hyperbolic system. In this work, we analyze the eigensystem of the CGL equations. We present the eigenvalues and the complete set of right eigenvectors. We also prove the linear degeneracy of some of the characteristic fields. Using the eigensystem for CGL equations, we propose HLL and HLLI Riemann solvers for the CGL system. Furthermore, we present the AFD-WENO schemes up to the seventh order in one dimension and demonstrate the performance of the schemes on several one-dimensional test cases.</description>

      <title>Improved Polynomial Bounds and Acceleration of GMRES by Solving a min-max Problem on Rectangles, and by Deflating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial convergence bounds are considered for left, right, and split preconditioned GMRES. They include the cases of Weighted and Deflated GMRES for a linear system Ax = b. In particular, the case of positive definite A is considered. The well-known polynomial bounds are generalized to the cases considered, and then reduced to solving a min-max problem on rectangles on the complex plane. Several approaches are considered and compared. The new bounds can be improved by using specific deflation spaces and preconditioners. This in turn accelerates the convergence of GMRES. Numerical examples illustrate the results obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in inverse scattering problems set in layered environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attempt to solve inverse scattering problems often leads to optimization and sampling problems that require handling moderate to large amounts of partial differential equations acting as constraints. We focus here on determining inclusions in a layered medium from the measurement of wave fields on the surface, while quantifying uncertainty and addressing the effect of wave solver quality. Inclusions are characterized by a few parameters describing their material properties and shapes. We devise algorithms to estimate the most likely configurations by optimizing cost functionals with Bayesian regularizations and wave constraints. In particular, we design an automatic Levenberg-Marquardt-Fletcher type scheme based on the use of algorithmic differentiation and adaptive finite element meshes for time dependent wave equation constraints with changing inclusions. In synthetic tests with a single frequency, this scheme converges in few iterations for increasing noise levels. To attain a global view of other possible high probability configurations and asymmetry effects we resort to parallelizable affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, at the cost of solving a few million wave problems. This forces the use of prefixed meshes. While the optimal configurations remain similar, we encounter additional high probability inclusions influenced by the prior information, the noise level and the layered structure, effect that can be reduced by considering more frequencies. We analyze the effect on the calculations of working with adaptive and fixed meshes, under a simple choice of non-reflecting boundary conditions in truncated layered domains for which we establish wellposedness and convergence results.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving LDG discretization of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation for modeling neurodegenerative diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a structure-preserving, high-order, unconditionally stable numerical method for approximating the solution to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation on polytopic meshes, with a particular focus on its application in simulating misfolded protein spreading in neurodegenerative diseases. The model problem is reformulated using an entropy variable to guarantee solution positivity, boundedness, and satisfaction of a discrete entropy-stability inequality at the numerical level. The scheme combines a local discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal meshes for the space discretization with a $\nu$-step backward differentiation formula for the time integration. Implementation details are discussed, including a detailed derivation of the linear systems arising from Newton's iteration. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through extensive numerical tests. Finally, the method's practical performance is demonstrated through simulations of \textalpha{}-synuclein propagation in a two-dimensional brain geometry segmented from MRI data, providing a relevant computational framework for modeling synucleopathies (such as Parkinson's disease) and, more generally, neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Eikonal boundary condition for level set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to use the eikonal equation as a boundary condition when advective or normal flow equations in the level set formulation are solved numerically on polyhedral meshes in the three-dimensional domain. Since the level set method can use a signed distance function as an initial condition, the eikonal equation on the boundary is a suitable choice at the initial time. Enforcing the eikonal equation on the boundary for later times can eliminate the need for inflow boundary conditions, which are typically required for transport equations. In selected examples where exact solutions are available, we compare the proposed method with the method using the exact Dirichlet boundary condition. The numerical results confirm that the use of the eikonal boundary condition provides comparable accuracy and robustness in surface evolution compared to the use of the exact Dirichlet boundary condition, which is generally not available. We also present numerical results of evolving a general closed surface.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Matching Pursuit based Reconstruction for Modulo Hysteresis Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlimited sampling provides an acquisition scheme for high dynamic range signals by folding the signal into the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using modulo non-linearity prior to sampling to prevent saturation. Recently, a generalized scheme called modulo hysteresis was introduced to account for hardware non-idealities. The encoding operator, however, does not guarantee that the output signal is within the dynamic range of the ADC. To resolve this, we propose a modified modulo hysteresis operator and show identifiability of bandlimited signals from modulo hysteresis samples. We propose a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit and validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Higher-order meshless schemes for hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the order, efficiency, stability and positivity of several meshless schemes for linear scalar hyperbolic equations. Meshless schemes are Generalised Finite Difference Methods (GFDMs) for arbitrary irregular grids in which there is no connectivity between the grid points. We propose a new MUSCL-like meshless scheme that uses a central stencil, with which we can achieve arbitrarily high orders, and compare it to existing meshless upwind schemes and meshless WENO schemes. The stability of the newly proposed scheme is guaranteed by an upwind reconstruction to the midpoints of the stencil. The new meshless MUSCL scheme is also efficient due to the reuse of the GFDM solution in the reconstruction. We combine the new MUSCL scheme with a Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) procedure to avoid spurious oscillations at discontinuities. In one spatial dimension, our fourth order MUSCL scheme outperforms existing WENO and upwind schemes in terms of stability and accuracy. In two spatial dimensions, our MUSCL scheme achieves similar accuracy to an existing WENO scheme but is significantly more stable.</description>

      <title>On non-local exchange and scattering operators in domain decomposition methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-local exchange and scattering operators arising in domain decomposition algorithms for solving elliptic problems on domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Motivated by recent formulations of the Optimized Schwarz Method introduced by Claeys, we rigorously analyze the behavior of a family of non-local exchange operators $\Pi_\gamma$, defined in terms of boundary integral operators associated to the fundamental solution for $-\Delta + \gamma^{-2}$, with $\gamma &gt; 0$. Our first main result establishes precise estimates comparing $\Pi_\gamma$ to its local counterpart $\Pi_0$ as $\gamma \to 0$, providing a quantitative bridge between the classical and non-local formulations of the Optimized Schwarz Method. In addition, we investigate the corresponding scattering operators, proving norm estimates that relate them to their classical analogues through a detailed analysis of the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. Our results clarify the relationship between classical and non-local formulations of domain decomposition methods and yield new insights that are essential for the analysis of these algorithms, particularly in the presence of cross points and for domains with curvilinear polygonal boundaries.</description>

      <title>Variational discretizations of viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics using structure-preserving finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel structure preserving discretization for viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics. We follow the recent line of work on discrete least action principle for fluid and plasma equation, incorporating the recent advances to model dissipative phenomena through a generalized Lagrange-d Alembert constrained variational principle. We prove that our semi-discrete scheme is equivalent to a metriplectic system and use this property to propose a Poisson splitting time integration. The resulting approximation preserves mass, energy and the divergence constraint of the magnetic field. We then show some numerical results obtained with our approach. We first test our scheme on simple academic test to compare the results with established methodologies, and then focus specifically on the simulation of plasma instabilities, with some tests on non Cartesian geometries to validate our discretization in the scope of tokamak instabilities.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic preserving scheme for the M1model of non-local thermal transport for two-dimensional structured and unstructured meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M1 moment model for electronic transport is commonly used to describe non-local thermal transport effects in laser-plasma simulations. In this article, we propose a new asymptotic-preserving scheme based on the Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme (UGKS) for this model in two-dimensional space. This finite volume kinetic scheme follows the same approach as in our previous article and relies on a moment closure, at the numerical scale, of the microscopic flux of UGKS. The method is developed for both structured and unstructured meshes, and several techniques are introduced to ensure accurate fluxes in the diffusion limit. A second-order extension is also proposed. Several test cases validate the different aspects of the scheme and demonstrate its efficiency in multiscale simulations. In particular, the results demonstrate that this method accurately captures non-local thermal effects.</description>

      <title>BC-ADMM: An Efficient Non-convex Constrained Optimizer with Robotic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-convex constrained optimizations are ubiquitous in robotic applications such as multi-agent navigation, UAV trajectory optimization, and soft robot simulation. For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.</description>

      <title>Physics-aware generative models for turbulent fluid flows through energy-consistent stochastic interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as text, image, and video synthesis. In this work, we explore the application of generative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation, where classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a novel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which enables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such as energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic generative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our approach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic interpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark turbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and stability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional diffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable results for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic interpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative models in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving fundamental conservation properties.</description>

      <title>Energy-Conserving Neural Network Closure Model for Long-Time Accurate and Stable LES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based closure models for LES have shown promise in capturing complex turbulence dynamics but often suffer from instabilities and physical inconsistencies. In this work, we develop a novel skew-symmetric neural architecture as closure model that enforces stability while preserving key physical conservation laws. Our approach leverages a discretization that ensures mass, momentum, and energy conservation, along with a face-averaging filter to maintain mass conservation in coarse-grained velocity fields. We compare our model against several conventional data-driven closures (including unconstrained convolutional neural networks), and the physics-based Smagorinsky model. Performance is evaluated on decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow for multiple coarse-graining factors. In these test cases we observe that unconstrained machine learning models suffer from numerical instabilities. In contrast, our skew-symmetric model remains stable across all tests, though at the cost of increased dissipation. Despite this trade-off, we demonstrate that our model still outperforms the Smagorinsky model in unseen scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of structure-preserving machine learning closures for reliable long-time LES.</description>

      <title>Stochastic numerical approximation for nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence rate of the Euler-Maruyama scheme for systems of interacting particles used to approximate solutions of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with singular interaction kernels, such as the Keller-Segel model. We derive explicit error estimates in the large-particle limit for two objects: the empirical measure of the interacting particle system and the density distribution of a single particle. Specifically, under certain assumptions on the interaction kernel and initial conditions, we show that the convergence rate of both objects towards solutions of the corresponding nonlinear FokkerPlanck equation depends polynomially on N (the number of particles) and on h (the discretization step). The analysis shows that the scheme converges despite singularities in the drift term. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing results in the literature of such kind for the singular kernels considered in this work.</description>

      <title>FEABench: Evaluating Language Models on Multiphysics Reasoning Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics, mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped with the ability to interact with the software through its Application Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex problems in the real world.

      <title>A score-based particle method for homogeneous Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel score-based particle method for solving the Landau equation in plasmas, that seamlessly integrates learning with structure-preserving particle methods [arXiv:1910.03080]. Building upon the Lagrangian viewpoint of the Landau equation, a central challenge stems from the nonlinear dependence of the velocity field on the density. Our primary innovation lies in recognizing that this nonlinearity is in the form of the score function, which can be approximated dynamically via techniques from score-matching. The resulting method inherits the conservation properties of the deterministic particle method while sidestepping the necessity for kernel density estimation in [arXiv:1910.03080]. This streamlines computation and enhances scalability with dimensionality. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical estimate by demonstrating that the KL divergence between our approximation and the true solution can be effectively controlled by the score-matching loss. Additionally, by adopting the flow map viewpoint, we derive an update formula for exact density computation. Extensive examples have been provided to show the efficiency of the method, including a physically relevant case of Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned FEM-based Neural Networks for Solving Incompressible Fluid Flows and Related Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical simulation and optimization of technical systems described by partial differential equations is expensive, especially in multi-query scenarios in which the underlying equations have to be solved for different parameters. A comparatively new approach in this context is to combine the good approximation properties of neural networks (for parameter dependence) with the classical finite element method (for discretization). However, instead of considering the solution mapping of the PDE from the parameter space into the FEM-discretized solution space as a purely data-driven regression problem, so-called physically informed regression problems have proven to be useful. In these, the equation residual is minimized during the training of the neural network, i.e., the neural network "learns" the physics underlying the problem. In this paper, we extend this approach to saddle-point and non-linear fluid dynamics problems, respectively, namely stationary Stokes and stationary Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we propose a modification of the existing approach: Instead of minimizing the plain vanilla equation residual during training, we minimize the equation residual modified by a preconditioner. By analogy with the linear case, this also improves the condition in the present non-linear case. Our numerical examples demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the training effort and greatly increases accuracy and generalizability. Finally, we show the application of the resulting parameterized model to a related inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Boundary Integral Formulations for Flexural Wave Scattering in Thin Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop second kind integral formulations for flexural wave scattering problems involving the clamped, supported, and free plate boundary conditions. While the clamped plate problem can be solved with layer potentials developed for the biharmonic equation, the free plate problem is more difficult due to the order and complexity of the boundary conditions. In this work, we describe a representation for the free plate problem that uses the Hilbert transform to cancel singularities of certain layer potentials, ultimately leading to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Additionally, for the supported plate problem, we improve on an existing representation to obtain a second kind integral equation formulation. With these representations it is possible to solve flexural wave scattering problems with high-order-accurate methods, examine the far field patterns of scattering objects, and solve large problems involving multiple scatterers.</description>

      <title>Randomized coupled decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled decompositions are a widely used tool for data fusion. As the volume of data increases, so does the dimensionality of matrices and tensors, highlighting the need for more efficient coupled decomposition algorithms. This paper studies the problem of coupled matrix factorization (CMF), where two matrices represented in low-rank form share a common factor. Additionally, it explores coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF), where a matrix and a tensor are represented in low-rank form, also sharing a common factor matrix. We show that these problems can be solved using a direct approach with singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than relying on an iterative method. Knowing that matrices coming from real-world applications are often very large, the computational cost can be substantial. To address this issue and improve the efficiency, we propose new techniques for randomizing these algorithms. This includes a novel strategy for selecting a projection subspace that takes into account the contribution from both matrices involved in the decomposition equally. We present extensive results of numerical tests that confirm the efficiency of our algorithms. Furthermore, as a novel approach and with a high success rate, we apply our randomized algorithms to the face recognition problem.</description>

      <title>Robust high-order low-rank BUG integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose high-order basis-update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators are high-order extensions of the BUG integrator and are constructed by performing a BUG step at each stage of the Runge-Kutta method. In this way, the resulting Runge-Kutta BUG integrator is robust to the presence of small singular values and does not involve backward time-integration steps. We provide an error bound, which shows that the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator retains the order of convergence of the associated Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation error and which vanishes as the rank becomes full. This error bound is finally validated experimentally on three numerical test cases. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other dynamical low-rank integrators proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>P-order: Unified Convergence Analysis for Nonlinear Iterative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring how quickly iterative methods converge is essential in computational mathematics, but current approaches have significant limitations. Q-order analysis requires strict smoothness conditions, while R-order analysis lacks precision and creates ambiguity, especially when analyzing convergence rates close to linear.
  We introduce P-order, a new framework that overcomes these limitations by using a power function $\psi(k)$ combined with asymptotic notation ($\Theta, o, \omega$). Our approach offers two key advantages: it works independently of the chosen norm while providing the precision needed to classify diverse convergence behaviors, including previously hard-to-characterize rates like fractional-power and linearithmic convergence. P-order also systematically accommodates weaker continuity conditions by naturally connecting mathematical assumptions to appropriate Taylor approximation forms.
  To enhance practical analysis, we develop two important subclasses, QUP-order and UP-order, which work effectively under different smoothness conditions. We demonstrate P-order's practical value through three applications: (1) refining fixed-point iteration analysis with minimal smoothness requirements (mere differentiability suffices where classical analysis required stronger conditions), (2) identifying previously unreported convergence rates for Newton's method and gradient descent algorithms, and (3) providing a unified analysis of $K$-point methods under $C^{K-1,\nu}$ (i.e., with H\"older continuous $(K-1)$th derivatives), yielding a new characteristic rate $q_{K}(\nu)$.
  Our P-order framework provides researchers and practitioners with a sharper, more comprehensive toolbox for convergence analysis, particularly valuable when classical assumptions fail or when analyzing complex convergence behaviors in modern computational applications.</description>
