      <title>Label-free microscope for rheological imaging of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many essential cellular functions depend on the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm. While techniques such as optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy can measure these properties, their reliance on localized probes prevents intracellular imaging and perturbs native cellular behaviour. Label-free microscopy offers a non-invasive alternative for observing intracellular dynamics. However, limitations in signal-to-noise ratio and imaging speed typically restrict analysis to diffusivity, leaving cellular viscous properties inaccessible. Here, we introduce rheoSCAT, a label-free, phase-sensitive microscope engineered with ultra-low phase noise. This system enables measurements of intracellular dynamics at frequencies up to 50 kHz, twenty times faster than previous label-free approaches. Applied to live cancer cells, this technique establishes a connection between label-free microscopy and rheology. The high speed of our technique reveals viscoelastic behaviours that were previously inaccessible, which we show are consistent with probe-based microrheology observations. The rheological images produced distinguish intra- and extracellular regions with high contrast, resolve spatial variations in cellular mechanics, and enable monitoring of cellular state and stress over time. The ability to quantitatively map intracellular energetics and viscoelasticity offers a powerful tool for advancing fundamental cell biology, cancer research, clinical diagnostics, and drug development.</description>

      <title>Latent Space-Driven Quantification of Biofilm Formation using Time Resolved Droplet Microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial biofilms play a significant role in various fields that impact our daily lives, from detrimental public health hazards to beneficial applications in bioremediation, biodegradation, and wastewater treatment. However, high-resolution tools for studying their dynamic responses to environmental changes and collective cellular behavior remain scarce. To characterize and quantify biofilm development, we present a droplet-based microfluidic platform combined with an image analysis tool for in-situ studies. In this setup, Bacillus subtilis was inoculated in liquid Lysogeny Broth microdroplets, and biofilm formation was examined within emulsions at the water-oil interface. Bacteria were encapsulated in droplets, which were then trapped in compartments, allowing continuous optical access throughout biofilm formation. Droplets, each forming a distinct microenvironment, were generated at high throughput using flow-controlled pressure pumps, ensuring monodispersity. A microfluidic multi-injection valve enabled rapid switching of encapsulation conditions without disrupting droplet generation, allowing side-by-side comparison. Our platform supports fluorescence microscopy imaging and quantitative analysis of droplet content, along with time-lapse bright-field microscopy for dynamic observations. To process high-throughput, complex data, we integrated an automated, unsupervised image analysis tool based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This AI-driven approach efficiently captured biofilm structures in a latent space, enabling detailed pattern recognition and analysis. Our results demonstrate the accurate detection and quantification of biofilms using thresholding and masking applied to latent space representations, enabling the precise measurement of biofilm and aggregate areas.</description>

      <title>Local imperfect feedback control in non-equilibrium biophysical systems enabled by thermodynamic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback, without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Emergent microtubule properties in a model of filament turnover and nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic protein filaments essential for intracellular organization and transport, particularly in long-lived cells such as neurons. The plus and minus ends of neuronal MTs switch between growth and shrinking phases, and the nucleation of new filaments is believed to be regulated in both healthy and injury conditions. We propose stochastic and deterministic mathematical models to investigate the impact of filament nucleation and length-regulation mechanisms on emergent properties such as MT lengths and numbers in living cells. We expand our stochastic continuous-time Markov chain model of filament dynamics to incorporate MT nucleation and capture realistic stochastic fluctuations in MT numbers and tubulin availability. We also propose a simplified partial differential equation (PDE) model, which allows for tractable analytical investigation into steady-state MT distributions under different nucleation and length-regulating mechanisms. We find that the stochastic and PDE modeling approaches show good agreement in predicted MT length distributions, and that both MT nucleation and the catastrophe rate of large-length MTs regulate MT length distributions. In both frameworks, multiple mechanistic combinations achieve the same average MT length. The models proposed can predict parameter regimes where the system is scarce in tubulin, the building block of MTs, and suggest that low filament nucleation regimes are characterized by high variation in MT lengths, while high nucleation regimes drive high variation in MT numbers. These mathematical frameworks have the potential to improve our understanding of MT regulation in both healthy and injured neurons.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>A Digital Phantom for MR Spectroscopy Data Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulated data is increasingly valued by researchers for validating MRS processing and analysis algorithms. However, there is no consensus on the optimal approaches for simulation models and parameters. This study introduces a novel MRS digital brain phantom framework, providing a comprehensive and modular foundation for MRS data simulation. The framework generates a digital brain phantom by combining anatomical and tissue label information with metabolite data from the literature. This phantom contains all necessary information for simulating spectral data. The MRS phantom is combined with a signal-based model to demonstrate its functionality and usability in generating various spectral datasets. Outputs can be saved in the NIfTI-MRS format, enabling their use in downstream applications. To evaluate the realism of the simulated spectra, a comparison was performed against in-vivo MRS data acquired under similar conditions. The phantom was implemented using two anatomical templates at different resolutions and tested across a range of user-defined simulation parameters. Simulated spectra exhibited realistic signal characteristics and structural variability. When compared to in-vivo data, the simulated spectra closely matched in terms of spectral shape, signal-to-noise ratio, and metabolite quantification. The simulations also captured key variability features and provided additional diversity not present in the in-vivo dataset, supporting use in robustness testing and data augmentation. This novel digital phantom provides a flexible and extensible platform for MRS data simulation. Its modular architecture, user-friendly GUI, and open-source implementation support reproducible research, algorithm development, and validation in the MRS community.</description>
