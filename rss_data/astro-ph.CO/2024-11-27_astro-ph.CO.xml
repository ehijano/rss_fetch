      <title>Non-thermal emission in galaxy groups at extremely low frequency: the case of A1213</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters and groups are the last link in the chain of hierarchical structure formation. Their environments can be significantly affected by outbursts from AGN, especially in groups where the medium density is lower and the gravitational potential shallower. The interaction between AGN and group weather can therefore greatly impact their evolution. We investigate the non-thermal radio emission in Abell 1213, a galaxy group which is part of a larger sample of ~50 systems (X-GAP) recently granted XMM-Newton observations. We exploit proprietary LOFAR 54 MHz and uGMRT 380 MHz observations, complementing them with 144 MHz LOFAR survey and XMM-Newton archival data. A1213 hosts a bright AGN associated with one of the central members, 4C 29.41, which was previously optically identified as a dumb-bell galaxy. Observations at 144 MHz at a resolution of 0.3'' allow us to resolve the central radio galaxy. From this source, a ~500 kpc-long tail extends North-East. Our analysis suggests that the tail likely originated from a past outburst of 4C 29.41, and its current state might be the result of the interaction with the surrounding environment. The plateau of the spectral index distribution in the Easternmost part of the tail suggests mild particle re-acceleration, that could have re-energised seed electrons from the past activity of the AGN. While we observe a spatial and physical correlation of the extended, central emission with the thermal plasma, which might hint at a mini-halo, current evidence cannot conclusively prove this. A1213 is only the first group, among the X-GAP sample, that we are able to investigate through low-frequency radio observations. Its complex environment once again demonstrates the significant impact that the interplay between thermal and non-thermal processes can have on galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Expanded Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (eGNILC) Framework for the 21-cm Foreground Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) method is a non-parametric component separation algorithm to remove the foreground contamination of the 21-cm intensity mapping data. In this work, we perform the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along the frequency axis in the expanded GNILC framework (denoted eGNILC) which helps reduce the power loss in low multipoles, and further demonstrate its performance. We also calculate the eGNILC bias to modify the criterion for determining the degrees of freedom of the foreground (dof), and embed the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) in mixing matrix computation to obtain a blind component separation method. We find that the eGNILC bias is related to the averaged domain size and the dof of the foreground but not the underlying 21-cm signal. In case of no beam effect, the eGNILC bias is negligible for simple power law foregrounds outside the Galactic plane. We also examine the eGNILC performance in the SKA-MID (SKA Phase-I in mid-frequency) and BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) simulations. We show that if the adjacent frequency channels are not highly correlated, eGNILC can recover the underlying 21-cm signal with good accuracy. With the varying Airy disk beam applied to both SKA-MID and BINGO, the power spectra of 21-cm can be effectively recovered at the multipoles $\ell \in [20, 250]$ and $[20, 300]$ respectively. With no instrumental noise, the SKA-MID exhibits $\lesssim 20\%$ power loss and BINGO exhibits $\sim 10\%$ power loss. The varying Airy-disk beam only causes significant errors at large multipoles.</description>

      <title>A Gigaparsec-Scale Hydrodynamic Volume Reconstructed with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of cosmological spectroscopic sky surveys will probe the distribution of matter across several Gigaparsecs (Gpc) or many billion light-years. In order to leverage the rich data in these new maps to gain a better understanding of the physics that shapes the large-scale structure of the cosmos, observed matter distributions must be compared to simulated mock skies. Small mock skies can be produced using precise, physics-driven hydrodynamical simulations. However, the need to capture small, kpc-scale density fluctuations in the intergalactic medium (IGM) places tight restrictions on the necessary minimum resolution of these simulations. Even on the most powerful supercomputers, it is impossible to run simulations of such high resolution in volumes comparable to what will be probed by future surveys, due to the vast quantity of data needed to store such a simulation in computer memory. However, it is possible to represent the essential features of these high-resolution simulations using orders of magnitude less memory. We present a hybrid approach that employs a physics-driven hydrodynamical simulation at a much lower-than-necessary resolution, followed by a data-driven, deep-learning Enhancement. This hybrid approach allows us to produce hydrodynamic mock skies that accurately capture small, kpc-scale features in the IGM but which span hundreds of Megaparsecs. We have produced such a volume which is roughly one Gigaparsec in diameter and examine its relevant large-scale statistical features, emphasizing certain properties that could not be captured by previous smaller simulations. We present this hydrodynamic volume as well as a companion n-body dark matter simulation and halo catalog which we are making publically available to the community for use in calibrating data pipelines for upcoming survey analyses.</description>

      <title>Super sample covariance and the volume scaling of galaxy survey covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super sample covariance (SSC) is important when estimating covariance matrices using a set of mock catalogues for galaxy surveys. If the underlying cosmological simulations do not include the variation in background parameters appropriate for the simulation sizes, then the scatter between mocks will be missing the SSC component. The coupling between large and small modes due to non-linear structure growth makes this pernicious on small scales. We compare different methods for generating ensembles of mocks with SSC built in to the covariance, and contrast against methods where the SSC component is computed and added to the covariance separately. We find that several perturbative expansions, developed to derive background fluctuations, give similar results. We then consider scaling covariance matrices calculated for simulations of different volumes to improve the accuracy of covariance matrix estimation for a given amount of computational time. On large scales, we find that the primary limitation is from the discrete number of modes contributing to the measured power spectrum, and we propose a new method for correcting this effect. Correct implementation of SSC and the effect of discrete mode numbers allows covariance matrices created from mocks to be scaled between volumes, potentially leading to a significant saving on computational resources when producing covariance matrices. We argue that a sub-percent match is difficult to achieve because of the effects of modes on scales between the box sizes, which cannot be easily included. Even so, a 3% match is achievable on scales of interest for current surveys scaling the simulation volume by 512x, costing a small fraction of the computational time of running full-sized simulations. This is comparable to the agreement between analytic and mock-based covariance estimates to be used with DESI Y1 results.</description>

      <title>Black Holes from Fermi Ball Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi balls are non-topological solitons that can naturally form in an early universe containing a dark sector with heavy fermions and an attractive interaction mediated by a light scalar field. We compute the Fermi ball mass and radius scaling relations when the potential of the scalar field $\varphi$ has a non-negligible quartic coupling $\lambda\varphi^4$. The resulting Fermi balls reach `saturation' very rapidly, even when their radius is much smaller than the effective Yukawa force range. These objects can therefore grow by mergers or by accretion of ambient dark fermions, until they become so dense that they fall within their Schwarzschild radius and collapse to black holes. This setup, therefore, provides an example of a rather natural and economical dark sector scenario for the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of the one-dimensional power spectrum of 21-cm forest based on a halo model method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.</description>

      <title>The BINGO/ABDUS Project: Forecast for cosmological parameter from a mock Fast Radio Bursts survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are hosts of surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and locate Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances. The BINGO project is one such surveys, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield with the main telescope helped by a set of outrigger stations. This paper aims to simulate and estimate the potential of FRBs in constraining our current cosmological model. We present a forecast of the future constraints that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially located BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. Still, they will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs detected by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity with DESI 2024 LRG and QSO samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the large-scale clustering of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Quasar (QSO) sample from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In particular, we constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) parameter $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ via the large-scale scale-dependent bias in the power spectrum using $1,631,716$ LRGs ($0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1$) and $1,189,129$ QSOs ($0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.1$). This new measurement takes advantage of the enormous statistical power at large scales of DESI DR1 data, surpassing the latest data release (DR16) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). For the first time in this kind of analysis, we use a blinding procedure to mitigate the risk of confirmation bias in our results. We improve the model of the radial integral constraint proposing an innovative correction of the window function. We also carefully test the mitigation of the dependence of the target selection on the photometry qualities by incorporating an angular integral constraint contribution to the window function, and validate our methodology with the blinded data. Finally, combining the two samples, we measure $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = {-3.6}_{-9.1}^{+9.0}$ at $68\%$ confidence, where we assume the universality relation for the LRG sample and a recent merger model for the QSO sample about the response of bias to primordial non-Gaussianity. Adopting the universality relation for the PNG bias in the QSO analysis leads to $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = 3.5_{-7.4}^{+10.7}$ at $68\%$ confidence. This measurement is the most precise determination of primordial non-Gaussianity using large-scale structure to date, surpassing the latest result from eBOSS by a factor of $2.3$.</description>

      <title>PSpectCosmo: A Pseudo-Spectral Code for Cosmological Dynamics Spanning Inflation and Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \texttt{PSpectCosmo} is a high-performance \texttt{C++} program developed to investigate early-universe cosmological dynamics, with a specific emphasis on the inflationary epoch. Utilizing a Fourier-space pseudo-spectral method, \texttt{PSpectCosmo} enables the precise evolution of interacting scalar fields and gravitational waves, ensuring accurate representation of the power spectrum during inflation. This approach overcomes key limitations of finite difference methods, particularly in maintaining consistency between effective and lattice wave vectors. The code employs the adaptive step size velocity-Verlet algorithm for time integration, offering a balance of numerical stability and high precision. Additionally, \texttt{PSpectCosmo} incorporates a robust mechanism to compute convergent energy density, effectively resolving the issue of divergent energy density at the onset of inflation. These capabilities establish \texttt{PSpectCosmo} as a reliable and versatile tool for probing non-linear cosmological phenomena and inflationary dynamics with exceptional accuracy. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JieJiang-Cosmology/PSpectCosmo.git</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the dispersion measure of Fast Radio Burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is sensitive to the electron distribution in the Universe, making it a promising probe of cosmology and astrophysical processes such as baryonic feedback. However, cosmological analyses of FRBs require knowledge of the contribution to the observed DM coming from the FRB host. The size and distribution of this contribution is still uncertain, thus significantly limiting current cosmological FRB analyses. In this study, we extend the baryonification (BCM) approach to derive a physically-motivated, analytic model for predicting the host contribution to FRB DMs. By focusing on the statistical properties of FRB host DMs, we find that our simple model is able to reproduce the probability distribution function (PDF) of host halo DMs measured from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations, as well as their mass- and redshift dependence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model allows for self-consistent predictions of the host DM PDF and the matter power spectrum suppression due to baryonic effects, as observed in these simulations, making it promising for modelling host-DM-related systematics in FRB analyses. In general, we find that the shape of the host DM PDF is determined by the interplay between the FRB and gas distributions in halos. Our findings indicate that more compact FRB profiles require shallower gas profiles (and vice versa) in order to match the observed DM distributions in hydrodynamic simulations. Furthermore, the analytic model presented here shows that the shape of the host DM PDF is highly sensitive to the parameters of the BCM. This suggests that this observable could be used as an interesting test bed for baryonic processes, complementing other probes due to its sensitivity to feedback on galactic scales. We further discuss the main limitations of our analysis, and point out potential avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>A long freeze is hard to achieve in the presence of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Non-topological solitons and quasi-solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons in relativistic field theories are not necessarily topologically charged. In particular, non-topological solitons -- known as Q-balls -- arise naturally in nonlinear field theories endowed with attractive interactions and internal symmetries. Even without stabilizing internal symmetries, quasi-solitons known as oscillons, which are long-lived, can also exist. Both Q-balls and oscillons have significant applications in cosmology and particle physics. This review is an updated account of the intriguing properties and dynamics of these non-topological solitons and quasi-solitons, as well as their important roles in early-universe scenarios and particle physics models.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Searches for strong gravitational lenses using convolutional neural nets in Early Release Observations of the Perseus field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) is predicted to find approximately 170 000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses from its lifetime observation of 14 000 deg^2 of the sky. Detecting this many lenses by visual inspection with professional astronomers and citizen scientists alone is infeasible. Machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used as an automated method of detecting strong lenses, and have proven fruitful in finding galaxy-galaxy strong lens candidates. We identify the major challenge to be the automatic detection of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses while simultaneously maintaining a low false positive rate. One aim of this research is to have a quantified starting point on the achieved purity and completeness with our current version of CNN-based detection pipelines for the VIS images of EWS. We select all sources with VIS IE &lt; 23 mag from the Euclid Early Release Observation imaging of the Perseus field. We apply a range of CNN architectures to detect strong lenses in these cutouts. All our networks perform extremely well on simulated data sets and their respective validation sets. However, when applied to real Euclid imaging, the highest lens purity is just 11%. Among all our networks, the false positives are typically identifiable by human volunteers as, for example, spiral galaxies, multiple sources, and artefacts, implying that improvements are still possible, perhaps via a second, more interpretable lens selection filtering stage. There is currently no alternative to human classification of CNN-selected lens candidates. Given the expected 10^5 lensing systems in Euclid, this implies 10^6 objects for human classification, which while very large is not in principle intractable and not without precedent.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet dynamical compactification scenarios and their ghosts in the tensor sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a cosmological context, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory contains, in $d+4$ dimensions, a dynamical compactification scenario in which the additional dimensions settle down to a configuration with a constant radion/scale factor. Sadly however this work demonstrates that such a quite appealing framework is plagued by instabilities, either from the background configuration's unsteadiness or the ghostly behaviors of the tensorial perturbations. New and stable solutions are found by relaxing one of the hypotheses defining the original compactification scenario. However, such configurations do not respect the current bounds on the speed of propagation of gravitational waves, and thus have to be discarded. Those results thus advocate for a comprehensive study of compactification scenarios in the Gauss-Bonnet framework, their stability, and the effects of matter inclusion.</description>

      <title>Probing vector gravitational atom with eccentric intermediate mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter, are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we investigate the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

Abstract: The gauge singlet right-handed neutrinos are one of the essential fields in neutrino mass models that explain tiny masses of active neutrinos. We consider the effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with these fields under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we provide a comprehensive study for the phenomenological consequences of various dimension six interactions employing various high and low energy observables such as the $pp\to\ell^\pm+\not{E}_T$, $pp\to j+\not{E}_T$, decays of proton, meson, tau and top, as well as the cosmological parameter $N_{\rm eff}$.</description>

      <title>On the statistical theory of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow: Scale and redshift variation of velocity and density distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the scale and redshift variation of density and velocity distributions in self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow by a halo-based non-projection approach. All particles are divided into halo and out-of-halo particles for redshift variation of distributions. Without projecting particle fields onto a structured grid, the scale variation is analyzed by identifying all particle pairs on different scales $r$. We demonstrate that: i) Delaunay tessellation can be used to reconstruct the density field. The density correlation, spectrum, and dispersion functions were obtained, modeled, and compared with the N-body simulation; ii) the velocity distributions are symmetric on both small and large scales and are non-symmetric with a negative skewness on intermediate scales due to the inverse energy cascade at a constant rate $\varepsilon_u$; iii) On small scales, the even order moments of pairwise velocity $\Delta u_L$ follow a two-thirds law $\propto{(-\varepsilon_ur)}^{2/3}$, while the odd order moments follow a linear scaling $\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n+1}\rangle=(2n+1)\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n}\rangle\langle\Delta u_L\rangle\propto{r}$; iv) The scale variation of the velocity distributions was studied for longitudinal velocities $u_L$ or $u_L^{'}$, pairwise velocity (velocity difference) $\Delta u_L$=$u_L^{'}$-$u_L$ and velocity sum $\Sigma u_L$=$u^{'}_L$+$u_L$. Fully developed velocity fields are never Gaussian on any scale, despite that they can initially be Gaussian; v) On small scales, $u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a $X$ distribution to maximize the system entropy; vi) On large scales, $\Delta u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a logistic or a $X$ distribution; vii) the redshift variation of the velocity distributions follows the evolution of the $X$ distribution involving a shape parameter $\alpha(z)$ decreasing with time.</description>

      <title>Cosmological measurement of the gravitational constant $G$ using the CMB, the BAO and the BBN</title>

Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have provided numerous new observations with increasing precision that have led to the era of precision cosmology. The exquisite quality of these observations opens new possibilities towards measuring fundamental constants with good precision and at scales which are complementary to the laboratory ones. In particular, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization spectra contain a wealth quantity of information, well beyond the basic cosmological parameters. In this paper, we update the precision on a cosmological determination of $G$ by using the latest Planck data release (PR4) in combination with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 1 and the primordial Helium fraction from BBN. We demonstrate a precision of $1.8\%$, corresponding to a $\sim25\%$ improvement compared to the literature. This measurement is compatible with laboratory ones within one standard deviation. Finally, we show that this cosmological measurement of $G$ is robust against several assumptions made on the cosmological model, in particular when considering a non-standard dark energy fluid or non-flat models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infer the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we find that PBHs are ruled out within the mass range $\sim[10^{-24},10^{-19}]M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-16}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The model-independent evidence of cosmic acceleration revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the null tests of cosmic accelerated expansion by using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find that the DESI BAO data provide strong evidence that the Universe has undergone accelerated expansion within the redshift range [0, 1.317]. Using Gaussian Process, we reconstruct the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ from the DESI BAO $F_{AP}(z)$ data, revealing that accelerated expansion persisted until $z \lesssim 0.7$ with a 99.7\% confidence level. Additionally, to provide insights into the Hubble tension problem, we propose to reconstruct $E(z)$ from the DESI BAO $F_{AP}$ data and then combine the reconstructed $E(z)$ with $D_H/r_d$ data to derive the model independent result $r_d h=100.3\pm 1.5$ Mpc. The result is consistent with that obtained from the measurements on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies using the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also propose a model-independent method for reconstructing $D_M(z)$ from SNe Ia data and combining the result with DESI BAO data of $D_M/r_d$ to constrain the value of $r_d$. We find that the value of $r_d$ derived from this model-independent method is smaller than that obtained from CMB measurements, with a significant discrepancy of at least 4.17$\sigma$. All the conclusions drawn in this paper are independent of cosmological models and gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by scalar clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study extreme mass-ratio binary systems in which a stellar mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole surrounded by a scalar cloud. Scalar clouds can form through superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around spinning black holes and can also serve as a proxy for dark matter halos. Our framework is fully relativistic and assumes that the impact of the cloud on the geometry can be treated perturbatively. As a proof of concept, here we consider a point particle in circular, equatorial motion around a non-spinning black hole surrounded either by a spherically symmetric or a dipolar non-axisymmetric scalar cloud, but the framework can in principle be generalized to generic black hole spins and scalar cloud geometries. We compute the leading-order power lost by the point particle due to scalar radiation and show that, in some regimes, it can dominate over gravitational-wave emission. We confirm the presence of striking signatures due to the presence of a scalar cloud that had been predicted using Newtonian approximations, such as resonances that can give rise to sinking and floating orbits, as well as "sharp features" in the power lost by the particle at given orbital radii. Finally, for a spherically symmetric scalar cloud, we also compute the leading-order corrections to the black-hole geometry and to the gravitational-wave energy flux, focusing only on axial metric perturbations for the latter. We find that, for non-compact clouds, the corrections to the (axial) gravitational-wave fluxes at high frequencies can be understood in terms of a gravitational-redshift effect, in agreement with previous works.</description>

Abstract: Extrapolating the Standard Model Higgs potential at high energies, we study the barrier between the electroweak and Planck scale minima. The barrier arises by taking the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses. We then extend the Standard Model by including a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and explore the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model. We point out that even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier; we find that the required value of the non-minimal coupling is smaller than the one needed for the conventional Higgs inflation scenario (which relies on a stable Standard Model Higgs potential, without any barrier); in addition, values of the top mass which are slightly larger than those required in the conventional scenario are allowed.</description>

Abstract: Internal kinematics of galaxies, traced through the stellar rotation curve or two dimensional velocity map, carry important information on galactic structure and dark matter. With upcoming surveys, the velocity map may play a key role in the development of kinematic lensing as an astrophysical probe. We improve techniques for extracting velocity information from integral field spectroscopy at low signal-to-noise ($S/N$), without a template, and demonstrate substantial advantages over the standard Penalized PiXel-Fitting method (pPXF) approach. Robust rotation curves can be derived down to $S/N\approx 2$ using our method.</description>

      <title>A comparison of pre-existing $\Lambda$CDM predictions with the abundance of {\it JWST} galaxies at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope} have revealed a high abundance of bright galaxies at redshift, $z\gtrsim 12$, which has been widely interpreted as conflicting with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In Cowley et al. (2018) predictions were made -- prior to the {\it JWST} observations -- for the expected abundance of these galaxies using the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model, {\sc galform}, which is known to produce a realistic population of galaxies at lower redshifts including the present day. Key to this model is the assumption of a ``top-heavy" initial mass function of stars formed in bursts (required to explain the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-millimetre galaxies). Here, we compare the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions derived from {\it JWST} observations with those predicted by the Cowley et al. model up to $z=14$ and make further predictions for $z=16$. We find that below $z\sim 10$, the Cowley et al. predictions agree very well with observations, while agreement at $z\gtrsim12$ requires extending the model to take into account the timescale for the growth of obscuring dust grains at these very early times and its dependence on gas metallicity. We trace the evolution of these galaxies from $z=14$ to $z=0$ and find that their descendants typically reside in halos with a median mass $2.5\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The stellar masses of the descendants range from $3.2\times 10^{6}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ to $3.2\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Although these galaxies were all central galaxies at $z=14$, over half of their descendants end up as satellites in massive halos.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Misaligned Ultralight Dark Matter and Implications for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the possibility that dark matter (DM) may be an ultralight scalar that was misaligned via non-minimal coupling to gravity, in the early Universe. For a certain regime of scalar masses, gravitational effects in neutron stars could place interesting bounds on the viable parameter space of the model, even in the absence of non-gravitational interactions between DM and ordinary matter.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

      <title>Inflation models with Peccei-Quinn symmetry and axion kinetic misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a consistent framework with the $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry for obtaining the initial condition for axion kinetic misalignment from inflation. We introduce a PQ complex scalar field and an extra Higgs doublet, which are conformally coupled to gravity, and three right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism. In the DFSZ type scenarios for the axion, we obtain the PQ anomalies from the Standard Model quarks carrying nonzero PQ charges in some of two Higgs doublet models, solving the strong CP problem by the QCD potential for the axion. Assuming that the PQ symmetry is explicitly violated in the scalar potential by quantum gravity effects, we show that a sufficiently large initial axion velocity can be obtained at the end inflation while avoiding the axion quality problem. As inflation is driven by the radial distance from the origin in the space of scalar fields close to the pole of the kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, we obtain successful inflationary predictions and set the initial axion velocity at the end of inflation. Focusing on the pure PQ inflation with a small running quartic coupling for the PQ field, we discuss the post-inflationary dynamics for the inflaton and the axion. As a result, we show that a sufficiently high reheating temperature, can be obtained dominantly from the Higgs-portal couplings to the PQ field, while being consistent with axion kinetic misalignment, the stability for the Higgs fields during inflation and the non-restoration of the PQ symmetry after reheating.</description>
