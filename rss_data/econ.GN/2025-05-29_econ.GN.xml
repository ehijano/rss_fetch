      <title>Forecasting Residential Heating and Electricity Demand with Scalable, High-Resolution, Open-Source Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for high-resolution forecasting of residential heating and electricity demand using probabilistic deep learning models. We focus specifically on providing hourly building-level electricity and heating demand forecasts for the residential sector. Leveraging multimodal building-level information -- including data on building footprint areas, heights, nearby building density, nearby building size, land use patterns, and high-resolution weather data -- and probabilistic modeling, our methods provide granular insights into demand heterogeneity. Validation at the building level underscores a step change improvement in performance relative to NREL's ResStock model, which has emerged as a research community standard for residential heating and electricity demand characterization. In building-level heating and electricity estimation backtests, our probabilistic models respectively achieve RMSE scores 18.3\% and 35.1\% lower than those based on ResStock. By offering an open-source, scalable, high-resolution platform for demand estimation and forecasting, this research advances the tools available for policymakers and grid planners, contributing to the broader effort to decarbonize the U.S. building stock and meeting climate objectives.</description>

      <title>Learning to Charge More: A Theoretical Study of Collusion by Q-Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing experimental evidence that $Q$-learning agents may learn to charge supracompetitive prices. We provide the first theoretical explanation for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the collusive-enabling price is a one-stage Nash equilibrium, whereas grim trigger policies can.</description>

      <title>Learning to Regulate: A New Event-Level Dataset of Capital Control Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a novel event-level Capital Control Measures (CCM) dataset covering 196 countries from 1999 to 2023 by leveraging prompt-based large language models (LLMs). The dataset enables event study analysis and cross-country comparisons based on rich policy attributes, including action type, intensity, direction, implementing entity, and other multidimensional characteristics. Using a two-step prompt framework with GPT-4.1, we extract structured information from the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), resulting in 5,198 capital control events with 27 annotated fields and corresponding model reasoning. Secondly, to facilitate real-time classification and extension to external sources, we fine-tune an open-source Meta Llama 3.1-8B model, named CCM-Llama, trained on AREAER change logs and final status reports. The model achieves 90.09\% accuracy in category classification and 99.55\% in status prediction. Finally, we apply the CCM dataset in an empirical application: an event study on China, Australia, and the US. The results show that inward capital control measures significantly reduce fund inflows within one month, and restrictive policies tend to have stronger effects than liberalizing ones, with notable heterogeneity across countries. Our work contributes to the growing literature on the use of LLMs in economics by providing both a novel high-frequency policy dataset and a replicable framework for automated classification of capital control events from diverse and evolving information sources.</description>

      <title>Distributional Consequences of Political Freedom: Inequality in Transition Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the origins of income inequality in post-socialist countries from Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, from 1991 to 2016. The aim is to analyze the relationship between democracy and income inequality. In previous studies, this topic has led to ambiguous findings, especially in the context of the group of countries we are focusing on. We examine whether the process of democratization cooccurred with changes in income distribution over the entire period under study, and its impact on individual income deciles to determine who benefited most from the new system. The obtained results allowed us to confirm that the actual relationship between democratization and income inequality did not exist, or at most was illusory in the 1990s, but it was present, relevant, and had a proequality character between 2001 and 2016. During that period, the development of the democratic system benefited at least 80\% of the lower part of the income distribution, at the expense especially of the top deciles share of total income. Those results confirmed that democratization positively affected the shares of lower income deciles in postsocialist countries.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for AI-Human Integration in Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has sparked debate over their role in complementing or replacing human workers across job contexts. We present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit, introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success, identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker. This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing them.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Pseudo-Goodwin Cycles in a Wage-Led Minsky Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of these notes is to make the concept of "pseudo goodwin cycles" mathematically more precise. At first the title seems like a contradiction to have a wage-led model and still find goodwin cycles in it, but the point we try to make in the paper is that those are only `pseudo-goodwin' cycles, and not real goodwin cycles.</description>

      <title>Financial literacy, robo-advising, and the demand for human financial advice: Evidence from Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of objective financial knowledge, confidence in one's financial skills, and digital financial literacy on individuals' decisions to seek financial advice from robo-advice platforms. Using microdata from the Bank of Italy's 2023 survey on Italian adults' financial literacy, we find that individuals with greater financial knowledge are less inclined to rely on online services for automated financial advice. Conversely, confidence in one's financial abilities and digital financial literacy enhance the likelihood of utilising robo-advice services. Trust in financial innovation, the use of digital financial services, and the propensity to take risks and save also emerge as significant predictors of an individual's use of robo-advice. We also provide evidence of a significant complementary relationship between the adoption of robo-advisory services and the demand for independent professional human advice. By contrast, a substitution effect is found for non-independent human advice. These findings highlight the importance of hybrid solutions in professional financial consulting, where robo-advisory services complement human financial advice.</description>
