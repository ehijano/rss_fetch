      <title>Does rainfall create buoyant forcing at the ocean surface?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rain affects the buoyancy of the upper ocean in two ways: The freshwater flux in rain makes the water fresher and lighter, stabilizing the ocean (a negative buoyancy flux). The convective systems that produce rain are often accompanied by cold, dry air, often called 'cold pools', and reduced short-wave radiation, which makes the water colder and heavier, destabilizing the ocean (a positive buoyancy flux). We estimate net buoyancy fluxes using in situ measurements from twenty-two moored buoys in the equatorial oceans under different rainfall categories. We find that buoyancy fluxes tend to destabilize the ocean during light rain (0.2-4 mm/hr) and stabilize the ocean during heavy rain (&gt;4 mm/hr). Furthermore, buoyancy fluxes during rain tend to be more positive at night than during the day, with nighttime rain twice as likely to cause instability compared to daytime rain, even at the same rainfall intensity. Average buoyancy fluxes across the tropics during rain can have either sign. These findings challenge the common assumption that rainfall makes the ocean surface lighter and provide a starting point for focusing on the overall effect of precipitation on the ocean.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Weather Models for Subregional Ocean Forecasting: A Case Study on the Canary Current Upwelling System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oceanographic forecasting impacts various sectors of society by supporting environmental conservation and economic activities. Based on global circulation models, traditional forecasting methods are computationally expensive and slow, limiting their ability to provide rapid forecasts. Recent advances in deep learning offer faster and more accurate predictions, although these data-driven models are often trained with global data from numerical simulations, which may not reflect reality. The emergence of such models presents great potential for improving ocean prediction at a subregional domain. However, their ability to predict fine-scale ocean processes, like mesoscale structures, remains largely unknown. This work aims to adapt a graph neural network initially developed for global weather forecasting to improve subregional ocean prediction, specifically focusing on the Canary Current upwelling system. The model is trained with satellite data and compared to state-of-the-art physical ocean models to assess its performance in capturing ocean dynamics. Our results show that the deep learning model surpasses traditional methods in precision despite some challenges in upwelling areas. It demonstrated superior performance in reducing RMSE errors compared to ConvLSTM and the GLORYS reanalysis, particularly in regions with complex oceanic dynamics such as Cape Ghir, Cape Bojador, and Cape Blanc. The model achieved improvements of up to 26.5% relative to ConvLSTM and error reductions of up to 76% in 5-day forecasts compared to the GLORYS reanalysis at these critical locations, highlighting its enhanced capability to capture spatial variability and improve predictive accuracy in complex areas. These findings suggest the viability of adapting meteorological data-driven models for improving subregional medium-term ocean forecasting.</description>

      <title>Assessing Future Wind Energy Potential under Climate Change: The Critical Role of Multi-Model Ensembles in Robustness Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate projections of wind energy potential under climate change are critical for effective long-term energy planning. While previous studies have highlighted the value of multi-model ensembles, they often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of uncertainties and temporal dynamics relevant to wind resource reliability. This paper presents one of the most comprehensive assessments to date, leveraging a large ensemble of 21 high-resolution RCM-GCM combinations from the EURO-CORDEX initiative to evaluate future wind energy conditions across Europe under the RCP8.5 scenario. Moving beyond mean values, we incorporate a novel event-based framework to analyze persistent high- and low-wind episodes using ERA5-derived percentile thresholds -- capturing operationally critical conditions that influence turbine performance and grid stability. To ensure statistical rigor, we apply the IPCC AR6 `Approach C' for robustness assessment, distinguishing climate signals from internal variability and quantifying model agreement. Crucially, we demonstrate that projections based on limited sub-ensembles can lead to contradictory or misleading conclusions, underscoring the essential role of ensemble diversity. The combination of spatial granularity, temporal detail, and formal uncertainty quantification makes this study a significant advancement in climate-informed wind energy research and a valuable tool for resilient energy system design.</description>

      <title>Terahertz prototype for air pollutants detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a prototype set-up exploiting terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to investigate gaseous compounds. The system is portable and allows to perform remote measurements. We used the prototype to characterise for the first time in literature over a broad THz range, pure dichloromethane and chloroform, two pollutants known as very short-lived substances (VSLS) that strongly contribute to ozone depletion. The THz range allows selectively detecting their absorption lines related to the rotational molecular motion for which we also present the theoretical confirmation. Then, we investigate the optical response of a multi-component mixture achieved with the two aforementioned chlorine-based compounds mixed with two widely distributed volatile pollutants (acetone and methanol). For these first measurements, we developed the set-up specifically for laboratory condition in which the substances are directly injected into the gas-cell circuit. Finally, we modified the prototype to ensure that the ambient atmosphere is drawn directly into the gas cell via a long pipe and a suction system opportunely developed. The analysis of the mixtures in both laboratory and in-field conditions demonstrates that the prototype together with the approach employed in this work can simultaneously identify and quantify single components in the atmosphere. The results obtained open up new possibilities for the development and applications of an efficient portable THz-based sensor for the remote detection of multi-component environmental contaminants.</description>

      <title>Physically Interpretable Emulation of a Moist Convecting Atmosphere with a Recurrent Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven convective parameterization aims to accurately represent convective adjustments to large-scale forcings in a computationally economic manner. While previous studies have demonstrated success using various model architectures, challenges persist in developing physically interpretable models and assessing generalizability and confidence level. In this study, we develop a recurrent neural network to predict time series of temperature, moisture, and precipitation of a cumulus ensemble in response to large-scale forcings. The recurrent cell combines a linear component, pre-identified as a time-invariant state-space model within the linear limit of the problem, and a multilayer neural network for the nonlinear component. Trained on ensembles of limited-domain cloud-resolving model simulation data, the model exhibits stable and realistic performance in long-term emulations, both with prescribed large-scale forcings and when coupled with two-dimensional gravity waves. We further calculate linear responses to perturbations for the coupled emulation, revealing physically interpretable, state-dependent properties of the convectively coupled gravity wave system.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Filter for Bayes-faithful Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear state space models (SSMs) is a challenging task. Existing assimilation methodologies predominantly assume Gaussian posteriors on physical space, where true posteriors become inevitably non-Gaussian. We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear SSMs. DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ in addition to the original physical variables $z_t$ and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on the new latent space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $r(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors remain Gaussian. Notably, the structured design of test distributions enables an analytical formula for the recursive computation, eliminating the accumulation of Monte Carlo sampling errors across time steps. DBF trains the Gaussian inverse observation operators $r(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments demonstrate that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in tasks where the true posterior distribution on physical space is significantly non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Fixing the Double Penalty in Data-Driven Weather Forecasting Through a Modified Spherical Harmonic Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in data-driven weather forecasting models have delivered deterministic models that outperform the leading operational forecast systems based on traditional, physics-based models. However, these data-driven models are typically trained with a mean squared error loss function, which causes smoothing of fine scales through a "double penalty" effect. We develop a simple, parameter-free modification to this loss function that avoids this problem by separating the loss attributable to decorrelation from the loss attributable to spectral amplitude errors. Fine-tuning the GraphCast model with this new loss function results in sharp deterministic weather forecasts, an increase of the model's effective resolution from 1,250km to 160km, improvements to ensemble spread, and improvements to predictions of tropical cyclone strength and surface wind extremes.</description>
