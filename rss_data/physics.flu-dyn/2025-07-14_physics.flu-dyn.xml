      <title>Predicting Flow Dynamics using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aimed to replicate and extend the results presented in the DiffFluid paper[1]. The DiffFluid model showed that diffusion models combined with Transformers are capable of predicting fluid dynamics. It uses a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) framework to tackle Navier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations. Our goal was to validate the reproducibility of the methods in the DiffFluid paper while testing its viability for other simulation types, particularly the Lattice Boltzmann method. Despite our computational limitations and time constraints, this work provides evidence of the flexibility and potential of the model as a general-purpose solver for fluid dynamics. Our results show both the potential and challenges of applying diffusion models to complex fluid dynamics problems. This work highlights the opportunities for future research in optimizing the computational efficiency and scaling such models in broader domains.</description>

      <title>Entropy-conservative numerical fluxes for compressible Euler equations with thermally perfect gas models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations that guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level for thermally perfect gases. The procedure is based on a locally conservative formulation, and extends the entropy-conserving schemes to the more realistic case of thermally perfect gases, while still guaranteeing preservation of both linear invariants and kinetic energy. The proposed methodology, which can also be extended to multicomponent gases and to an Asymptotically Entropy-Conservative formulation, shows advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to existing similar approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for chemical kinetic modeling in ammonia-methane combustion with a posteriori validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown considerable potential for alleviating the primary computational bottleneck in combustion simulations: the direct integration of stiff chemical ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in chemical kinetic modeling. This study investigates the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) as surrogate models for chemical kinetics in ammonia/methane combustion. Thermochemical training data are generated through manifold sampling of one-dimensional (1D) freely propagating premixed laminar flames. To address data imbalance near the flame front, where steep temperature gradients are present, a hybrid interpolation and randomization-based data augmentation strategy is introduced to enrich underrepresented regions in the training dataset. This refinement enhances model accuracy in 1D laminar flame validation tests. Furthermore, a posteriori evaluation in a two-dimensional (2D) propagating flame under homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) demonstrates that the trained DNN models retain predictive accuracy under previously unseen conditions while achieving up to a 20x overall speedup in computational performance. These results highlight the potential of DNN-based chemical kinetics to accelerate ammonia combustion modeling, supporting more efficient and scalable high-fidelity simulations for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Generative artificial intelligence and hybrid models to accelerate LES in reactive flows: Application to hydrogen/methane combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing emphasis on carbon neutrality, accurate and efficient combustion prediction has become essential for the design and optimization of new generation combustion systems. This study established a computational framework by combining large eddy simulation (LES) with a generative machine learning approach which integrates modal decomposition and neural network, enabling fast prediction of hydrogen-methane combustion. A canonical jet-in-hot-coflow burner was selected as the benchmark configuration. LES was performed using eddy dissipation concept model in conjunction with a 17-species and 58-step skeletal mechanism. Reasonable agreement between LES results and experimental data was obtained for temperature and species mass fraction, confirming the accuracy of the present LES results. Flow characteristics and flame structures were analyzed, providing a reference for choosing parameters in prediction. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was used to extract dominant flow features, and a hybrid autoregressive model, which combines modal decomposition with a deep learning (POD-DL) was constructed to forecast the temporal evolution of the combustion field. Comparison between the predicted results and LES data, including instantaneous contours, radial distributions, histogram and relative root mean square error, demonstrated a reasonable agreement. The main complexity lies in capturing the chaotic and fine-scale structures inherent to turbulent combustion. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of such a hybrid generative model to reactive flow prediction, representing an important step toward using data-driven surrogates to accelerate CFD simulations in combustion research. The proposed approach achieves speed-up ratios of 121 and 845 relative to LES for two tested cases. The implementation will be integrated into the upcoming release of the ModelFLOWs-app.</description>

      <title>Impacts of internal heating on temperature distribution in channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molten-salt-fuelled reactor systems, the fluid may experience substantial volumetric heat generation in addition to heat removal from surrounding structures. To quantify these effects, we investigate developed channel flow with internal heating using a systematic multi-scale approach comprising Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and a semi-analytical solver (SAS). First, DNS and LES are compared in a turbulent parallel-plate configuration at different Prandtl and Reynolds numbers, demonstrating excellent agreement in flow and thermal fields, with the SAS method showing acceptable accuracy. Building on this benchmarking, the SAS tool is then employed to explore a broad parameter space, offering insights into how internal heat deposition modifies the temperature distribution across Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Comparisons are also drawn against the canonical wall-heating scenario, revealing that volumetric heating often remains a secondary effect in turbulent regimes but can become more pronounced at lower Reynolds numbers, higher Prandtl numbers, or when nearly all heat is deposited in the fluid. These findings establish guidelines for reduced-order modeling in liquid-fuel reactor analyses and highlight conditions under which internal heating warrants particular attention. The paper concludes by outlining ongoing and future research directions, including refinements for variable fluid properties and complex geometry extensions.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.</description>

      <title>Active flow control of vertical-axis wind turbines: Insights from large-eddy simulation and finite-time resolvent analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active flow control is applied to improve the aerodynamic performance of a NACA0018 airfoil operating as a single-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). Results computed by wall-resolved large-eddy simulations (LES) highlight the detrimental effects of the dynamic stall vortex (DSV) and trailing-edge vortex (TEV) on turbine efficiency, primarily through increased drag and energy loss. The proposed flow control strategy effectively delays flow separation and suppresses large-scale vortex formation, particularly at moderate actuation frequencies. The control parameters are grounded in bi-global stability and finite-time resolvent analyses. These techniques identify the excitation of coupling modes between shear layer and wake instabilities as a mechanism for promoting flow reattachment and preventing vorticity accumulation, ultimately leading to enhanced torque production. The control strategy is energy-efficient, consuming only 1% of the turbine's output power while yielding substantial aerodynamic performance gains. These findings demonstrate the promise of physics-informed active flow control in mitigating dynamic stall and advancing the design of next-generation VAWTs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Thermoacoustic Waves: A Variational Approach Consistent with Thermodynamics and the Navier-Stokes Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes an in-depth investigation into the emergence of thermoacoustic waves from a variational formalism rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Differing from traditional approaches based on linear simplifications, this work explores the possibility of deriving wave equations for pressure and density through the extremization of thermodynamic functionals, with special attention to entropy production. We address the inherent complexities in applying variational principles to dissipative systems, incorporating the nuances of Prigogine\'s minimum and maximum entropy production principles. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of nonholonomic constraints, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, through concepts of vakonomic mechanics, and explore how thermoacoustic solutions can offer ansatzes valuable for the existence and smoothness problem of Navier-Stokes solutions, one of the Clay Math Institute\'s Millennium Problems. The objective is to provide a robust theoretical foundation that can shed new light on the interconnection between thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and wave phenomena</description>

      <title>Discontinuity-aware KAN-based physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proved to be a promising method for the rapid solving of partial differential equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. However, due to the smoothness assumption of functions approximated by general neural networks, PINNs are prone to spectral bias and numerical instability and suffer from reduced accuracy when solving PDEs with sharp spatial transitions or fast temporal evolution. To address this limitation, a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) method is proposed. It incorporates an adaptive Fourier-feature embedding layer to mitigate spectral bias and capture sharp changes, a discontinuity-aware Kolmogorov-Arnold network for the modeling of shockwave properties, mesh transformation to accelerate loss function convergence for complex geometries, and learnable local artificial viscosity to stabilize the algorithm near discontinuities. In numerical experiments regarding the inviscid Burgers' equation and transonic and supersonic airfoil flows, DPINN demonstrated superior accuracy when calculating discontinuities compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Flow-acoustic resonance in deep and inclined cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents numerical investigations of flow-acoustic resonances in deep and inclined cavities using wall-resolved large-eddy simulations. A cavity with $D/L = 2.632$ is subjected to ($M_\infty=0.2$ and $0.3$) at three inclination angles ($\alpha=30^{\circ}$, $60^{\circ}$, and $90^{\circ}$). Fully turbulent boundary layers from precursor simulations are employed upstream of the cavities. The simulation results show significant differences between inclined and orthogonal cavity flows, particularly at $M_{\infty} = 0.3$, where the inclined cavities exhibit stronger resonances (by more than 20 dB) at a lower peak frequency ($St=0.276$) than the orthogonal cavity, whose peak occurs at $St=0.849$. Acoustic modal analysis identifies these frequencies as the 1st and 2nd eigenmodes. Further analysis shows that the mode selection is linked to the hydrodynamic modes that pair with the acoustic modes. In the orthogonal cavity, the 2nd hydrodynamic mode prevails, in which two small vortices travel across the cavity opening. In the inclined cavities, however, a single large-scale roll-up vortex is generated owing to the strong Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer. Importantly, this vortex spends much of its lifetime growing in size rather than traveling rapidly downstream, resulting in a longer crossing time per cycle that correlates with the 1st acoustic eigenmode frequency. Furthermore, aeroacoustic resolvent analysis indicates that inclined cavities amplify acoustic responses effectively and exhibit weaker source-sink cancellation than the orthogonal cavity. These mechanisms are the primary contributors to the enhanced aeroacoustic response of the inclined cavities. Finally, it is proposed that the ratio of acoustic particle displacement to momentum thickness can be used for predicting the onset of deep cavity resonance associated with the identified distinctive vortex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of internal cnoidal waves with local defects in a two-layer fluid with rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal waves in a two-layer fluid with rotation are considered within the framework of Helfrich's f-plane extension of the Miyata-Maltseva-Choi-Camassa (MMCC) model. Within the scope of this model, we develop an asymptotic procedure which allows us to obtain a description of a large class of uni-directional waves leading to the Ostrovsky equation and allowing for the presence of shear inertial oscillations and barotropic transport. Importantly, unlike the conventional derivations leading to the Ostrovsky equation, the constructed solutions do not impose the zero-mean constraint on the initial conditions for any variable in the problem formulation. Using the constructed solutions, we model the evolution of quasi-periodic initial conditions close to the cnoidal wave solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation but having a local amplitude and/or periodicity defect, and show that such initial conditions can lead to the emergence of bursts of large internal waves and shear currents. As a by-product of our study, we show that cnoidal waves with expansion defects discussed in this work are generalised travelling waves of the KdV equation: they satisfy all conservation laws of the KdV equation (appropriately understood), as well as the Weirstrass-Erdmann conditions for broken extremals of the associated variational problem and a natural weak formulation. Being smoothed in numerical simulations, they behave, in the absence of rotation, as long-lived states with no visible evolution, while rotation changes this behaviour and leads to the emergence of strong bursts.</description>

      <title>Compressibility correction to the k-$\omega$ turbulence model that considers the wall-cooling effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In supersonic and hypersonic flows, the near-wall density variation due to wall cooling poses a challenge for accurately predicting the near-wall velocity and temperature profiles using classical eddy viscosity turbulence models. Compressible turbulent boundary layers are known to follow the universal wall law via semi-local transformation. However, developing a turbulence model that predicts a velocity profile, which, via semi-local transformation, follows the universal wall law, remains challenging. The current paper builds upon Danis-Durbin's practice of modifying the $\omega$ equation and proposes a simple modification to the $k-\omega$ two-equation model. The formulation of the proposed modification involves dimensional analysis and the proper selection of the local length scale. The newly introduced modification is used to modify the slope of the velocity profile starting from the viscous layer to above. It recovers a semi-local scaling of turbulent kinetic energy, viscosity, and eddy frequency, then achieves a very decent correction of the velocity profile in compressible turbulent channel flows, satisfying the universal wall law after applying Trettel \&amp; Larsson's transformation. The proposed new $k-\omega$ model can also improve the velocity and temperature predictions in strongly wall-cooled zero-pressure-gradient hypersonic turbulent boundary layers, compared to the original $k-\omega$ model. Validation using the favorable and adverse pressure gradient boundary layers suggests that the model does not impose a negative effect on the original $k-\omega$ model.</description>

      <title>The Full Nonlinear Vortex Tube-Vorton Method: the post-stall condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original concepts behind The Full Nonlinear Vortex Tube-Vorton Method (FTVM) have been applied to the study of massively separated fluid flow past a thin body. In the pre-stall condition, the Kutta-Zhukovski (KJ) force calculation was successfully implemented. However, for the post-stall condition, this approach is not capable of capturing the form drag component. Thus, an alternative force calculation method is implemented. The results obtained demonstrate that the fluid motion involving complex wake dynamics can be accurately approximated by a low-order, low-discretization numerical method based purely on vorticity and velocity concepts. This method avoids the need to discuss and speculate about the role of pressure on fluid motion, even in the turbulent regime. Consequently, it simplifies the understanding of complex low-speed aerodynamics by returning to the first principles.</description>

      <title>High-resolution simulations unravel intensification mechanisms of pyrocumulonimbus clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorms -- wildfire-generated thunderstorms -- can trigger rapid fire spread. However, the multi-physics nature of pyroCb has made their core mechanisms inaccessible to direct observation and previous simulation and prediction efforts. We introduce a new simulation capability with the first high-resolution, fully coupled simulations of a pyroCb, allowing us to unravel its life cycle governed by two opposing mechanisms. We show fuel moisture is an energy sink that attenuates fire intensity rather than fueling clouds, resolving a long-standing debate. Conversely, we identify the driver of rapid intensification: the Self-Amplifying Fire-Induced Recirculation (SAFIR) mechanism, where precipitation-induced downdrafts intensify the parent fire under weak winds. This work provides a new mechanistic framework for pyroCb prediction and demonstrates a transformative computational approach for previously intractable problems in environmental science.</description>
