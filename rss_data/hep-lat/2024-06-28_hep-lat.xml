      <title>Quantum computational resources for lattice QCD in the strong-coupling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the strong coupling limit of lattice QCD with massless staggered quarks and study the resource requirements for quantum simulating the theory in its Hamiltonian formulation. The bosonic Hilbert space of the color-singlet degrees of freedom grows quickly with the number of quark flavors, making it a suitable testing ground for resource considerations across different platforms. In particular, in addition to the standard model of computation with qubits, we consider mapping the theory to qudits $(d&gt;2)$ and qumodes, as used on trapped-ion systems and photonic devices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Physical-mass calculation of $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$ resonance parameters via $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our study of the $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$ resonances from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) employing domain-wall fermions at physical quark masses. We determine the finite-volume energy spectrum in various momentum frames and obtain phase-shift parameterizations via the L\"uscher formalism, and as a final step the complex resonance poles of the $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ elastic scattering amplitudes via an analytical continuation of the models. By sampling a large number of representative sets of underlying energy-level fits, we also assign a systematic uncertainty to our final results. This is a significant extension to data-driven analysis methods that have been used in lattice QCD to date, due to the two-step nature of the formalism. Our final pole positions, $M+i\Gamma/2$, with all statistical and systematic errors exposed, are $M_{K^{*}} = 893(2)(8)(54)(2)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{K^{*}} = 51(2)(11)(3)(0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $K^*(892)$ resonance and $M_{\rho} = 796(5)(15)(48)(2)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{\rho} = 192(10)(28)(12)(0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $\rho(770)$ resonance. The four differently grouped sources of uncertainties are, in the order of occurrence: statistical, data-driven systematic, an estimation of systematic effects beyond our computation (dominated by the fact that we employ a single lattice spacing), and the error from the scale-setting uncertainty on our ensemble.</description>

      <title>Light and strange vector resonances from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first ab initio calculation at physical quark masses of scattering amplitudes describing the lightest pseudoscalar mesons interacting via the strong force in the vector channel. Using lattice quantum chromodynamics, we postdict the defining parameters for two short-lived resonances, the $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$, which manifest as complex energy poles in $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ scattering amplitudes, respectively. The calculation proceeds by first computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the two-hadron systems, and then determining the amplitudes from the energies using the L\"uscher formalism. The error budget includes a data-driven systematic error, obtained by scanning possible fit ranges and fit models to extract the spectrum from Euclidean correlators, as well as the scattering amplitudes from the latter. The final results, obtained by analytically continuing multiple parameterizations into the complex energy plane, are $M_\rho = 796(5)(50)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $\Gamma_\rho = 192(10)(31)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $M_{K^*} = 893(2)(54)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{K^*} = 51(2)(11)~\mathrm{MeV}$, where the subscript indicates the resonance and $M$ and $\Gamma$ stand for the mass and width, respectively, and where the first bracket indicates the statistical and the second bracket the systematic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons in constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dibaryons are the simplest system in which the baryon-baryon interaction, and hence the underlying quark-quark interaction, can be studied in a clear way. Although the only dibaryon known today is the deuteron (and possibly the $d^*$), fully heavy dibaryons are good candidates for bound states because in such systems the kinetic energy is small and the high symmetry of the wave function favours binding. In this study, the possible existence of $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons is investigated in the framework of a constituent quark model that satisfactorily describes the deuteron, the $d^*(2380)$ and the $NN$ interaction. $J^P=0^+$ candidates are found in both systems with binding energies of the order of MeV.</description>

      <title>Chiral Analysis of the Nucleon Mass and Sigma Commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schemes for describing the light quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass calculated in lattice QCD are compared. The three schemes in consideration include a fully relativistic and Lorentz covariant scheme, one that is fully relativistic but not Lorentz covariant, and a semirelativistic scheme utilizing the heavy baryon approximation. Calculations of observables involving pseudoscalar meson loop diagrams generate nonanalytic terms proportional to square roots and logarithms of the quark mass. The three schemes all yield the correct model independent leading and next-to-leading nonanalytic terms of the chiral expansion of the baryon mass. Results for the masses of the other members of the octet are also presented. Here, low-energy coefficients of the analytic terms of the expansion for the nucleon and hyperons are constrained by lattice QCD results and are demonstrated to be independent of the renormalization scheme used. The differences in the leading coefficient of the chiral expansions are found to be consistent with strange quark counting. Using the schemes examined herein, we report results for the pion-nucleon sigma commutator based upon recent lattice results from the CLS Collaboration. We find $\sigma_{\pi N}=51.7 \pm 3.2 \pm 1.4$ MeV where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic respectively.</description>
