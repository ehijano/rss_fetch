      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>New spectrum of charm-strange meson with constituent quark model $c\bar{s}$ contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the $S$-wave interactions between Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) and charmed mesons in the $(S,I)=(1,0)$ sector using the chiral unitary approach. The scattering amplitudes incorporate both the Weinberg-Tomozawa term and additional contributions from $s$- and $u$-channel exchanges of $c\bar{s}$ states predicted by the constituent quark model (CQM). Through analytic continuation of the unitarized amplitudes to the complex energy plane, we identify multiple poles corresponding to bound states and resonances. Our analysis reveals a rich spectrum of $D_{sJ}$ states across $J^P = 0^+, 1^+, 1^-$, and $2^-$ sectors, providing new insights into the nature of established resonances like $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, while predicting several new states that could be observed in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Stringent Constraints on Gravitational Wave Signatures of Dark Electromagnetism in Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers have studied compact object mergers and solidified our understanding of strong gravity. Their increasing precision raises the possibility of detecting new physics, especially in a neutron star binary system that may contain hidden-sector particles. In particular, a new vector force between binary constituents, giving rise to dark electromagnetic phenomena, could measurably alter the inspiral waveforms and thus be constrained by gravitational wave observations. In this work, we critically examine the mechanisms for neutron stars to acquire enough hidden-sector particles with requisite couplings to furnish a detectable signature from dark electromagnetism. We demonstrate that the repulsive nature of vector forces imposes stringent constraints on any putative particle physics model or astrophysical environment which could give rise to such gravitational signatures. We argue that absent an extreme fine-tuning of parameters, such signatures are well out of reach of any current or near-future gravitational wave observatory.</description>

      <title>Hawking heating of neutron stars by dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions with particle dark matter could brighten old, isolated neutron stars to thermal luminosities detectable at current and next-generation telescopes. We present a novel mechanism for such signals. Non-annihilating (e.g., asymmetric) dark matter capturing in a neutron star could form a small black hole in its core, which could then rapidly evaporate away. If black holes form and evaporate within the cooling timescale of the neutron star, periodic episodes of black hole evaporation could impart a steady-state stellar luminosity, providing a source of heat additional to the kinetic energy of dark matter during capture. Consequently, we obtain sensitivities to dark matter-nucleon cross sections that are stronger than that from dark kinetic heating by a factor of a few for &gt; $10^4$ GeV (&gt; $10^{10}$ GeV) mass of spin-0 (spin-1/2) dark matter.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Charged Higgs Signal at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery prospects of a charged Higgs boson ($H^\pm$)
  at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) via the process
  $cg\to bH^\pm \to bc\bar{b}$ within the framework of a general two Higgs
  doublet model (G2HDM).
  In most two Higgs doublet models, the $H^+ cb$ coupling ($g_{H^+cb}$)
  is usually suppressed by the CKM matrix element $V_{cb}$.
  In G2HDM, there are additional Yukawa couplings,
  the process $cg\to bH^\pm \to bc\bar{b}$ is enhanced
  by the coupling $g_{H^+cb} \simeq \rtc V_{tb}$
  in both the production and decay of the charged Higgs boson.
  We study possible physics backgrounds and evaluate the discovery
  potential with realistic acceptance cuts and tagging efficiencies at
  collider energies of $\sqrt{s}=$13 and 14 TeV.
  We apply $b$-tagging and $c$-tagging and show that $m_{H^+}$ can be
  extracted by pairing the tagged $b$ and $c$-jets.
  Our analysis leads to promising results for the current LHC and
  expected high-luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Naive $T$-odd Drell-Yan angular coefficients as a probe of the dimension-8 SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the ``naive" $T$-odd Collins-Soper moments in the Drell-Yan process as probes of previously unexplored directions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) parameter space. We show that the moments $A_6$ and $A_7$ in the high invariant mass and transverse momentum region are sensitive to dimension-8 $CP$-odd semi-leptonic four-fermion operators with an additional gluon field strength tensor. Using the projected integrated luminosity of a future high-luminosity LHC, we show that effective ultraviolet scales in the few-TeV range can be probed with this process.</description>

      <title>ALP-mediated Dark Matter-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of dark matter-nucleon scattering via the exchange of axion-like particles (ALPs). At first sight, this might appear of little practical use, as non-relativistic scattering through pseudo-scalar interactions is momentum-suppressed and spin-dependent, resulting in scattering rates below any experimental sensitivity. We show that the scattering rate can be drastically enhanced in two ways. First, light ALPs with masses below the typical momentum transfer at direct detection experiments lift the momentum suppression by acting as essentially massless mediators. Second, ALP exchange through loops induces coherent spin-independent scattering. If the ALP has flavor-changing couplings to up-type quarks, loop-induced scattering receives an extra strong enhancement by the top-quark mass. We deduce that, contrary to common lore, XENONnT and PandaX-4T are already sensitive to ALP-mediated dark matter-nucleon scattering. The next generation of direct detection experiments will probe far into the parameter space of the ALP effective theory, potentially exceeding the sensitivity of collider searches.</description>

      <title>Probing High Reheating Temperatures by Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the benchmark freeze in dark matter (DM) scenario for direct detection experiments, in which a DM candidate interacts with the Standard Model (SM) through an ultralight dark photon, becomes sensitive to the visible sector reheating temperature if it is sufficiently high. At such temperatures, the irreducible ultraviolet (UV) freeze in production of DM through graviton exchange becomes important and must be combined with the infrared (IR) freeze in yield mediated by the dark photon. As long as gravitationally produced DM does not equilibrate through annihilation into dark photons and the subsequent formation of a dark thermal bath, it retains information about the reheating phase. Including this gravitational contribution relaxes the required DM and SM portal coupling and allows smaller values than those that would match the observed relic abundance through IR freeze in alone. Since current direct detection experiments have excluded the benchmark freeze in model over a wide range of DM masses, they are now effectively probing high reheating temperatures and the gravitational freeze in of DM.</description>

      <title>Two Puzzles, One Solution: Neutrino Mass and Secluded Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal secluded dark-matter (DM) framework based on an extra $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. The model contains a Dirac DM particle $\chi$, three heavy neutrinos $N_I$ with masses $M_{N,I}$, and a singlet scalar $R$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $\Phi$ by an angle $\alpha$. A symmetry forbids the $\Phi$-$R$ portal at tree level; the leading portal then arises at one loop from the same Yukawa structures that generate active neutrino masses $m_{\nu,I}$, implying $\tan(2\alpha) \propto \sum_I m_{\nu,I} M^2_{N,I}/(v_h m_H^2)$, where $v_h$ and $m_H$ are the SM Higgs VEV and mass. For heavy-neutrino masses in the multi-TeV range, this yields a naturally tiny mixing, $\tan(2\alpha)\sim 5\times 10^{-11}\left(M_N/10~\mathrm{TeV}\right)^2$, which strongly suppresses DM signals in direct, indirect, and collider searches. For PeV-scale heavy neutrinos the DM-nucleon cross section can instead enter the reach of direct-detection experiments. The visible and dark sectors thermalize at temperatures of order a few times the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino, then subsequently decouple, and typically evolve with a slightly hotter dark bath. In the secluded regime, with $\tan(2\alpha)\ll 1$ and $m_\chi&gt;m_{H_p}$, the relic density is set by $p$-wave annihilation $\chi\bar\chi \to H_p H_p$ (with $H_p$ the Higgs-like particle of the dark sector), and the dark-sector Yukawa couplings required to reproduce the observed abundance are $\sim(0.1\text{-}1)$, as in the standard WIMP case. For heavy-neutrino masses $\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{TeV}$, the mediator decays before nucleosynthesis without spoiling BBN observables, while the tiny portal suppresses present-day signals below current and near-future sensitivities. This links two long-standing puzzles, the absence of DM signals and the smallness of neutrino masses, within a predictive thermal framework.</description>

      <title>An NLO-Matched Initial and Final State Parton Shower on a GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments have demonstrated the potential for high simulation speeds and reduced energy consumption by porting Monte Carlo Event Generators to GPUs. We release version 2 of the CUDA C++ parton shower event generator GAPS, which can simulate initial and final state emissions on a GPU and is capable of hard-process matching. As before, we accompany the generator with a near-identical C++ generator to run simulations on single-core and multi-core CPUs. Using these programs, we simulate NLO Z production at the LHC and demonstrate that the speed and energy consumption of an NVIDIA V100 GPU are on par with a 96-core cluster composed of two Intel Xeon Gold 5220R Processors, providing a potential alternative to cluster computing.</description>

      <title>Hard exclusive photoproduction of photon-meson pairs: pseudoscalar channels $\pi$, $\eta$ and $\eta'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hard exclusive photoproduction of photon-meson pairs at leading-twist and leading-order in perturbative QCD, and focus on pseudoscalar mesons $\text{M} \in \{\pi^\pm, \pi^0, \eta, \eta'\}$. Compact analytical expressions are obtained for the amplitudes involving quark generalized parton distributions, with the two-gluon components of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ distribution amplitudes included. The numerical analysis is performed in the moderate-$\xi$ region, where valence-quark GPDs are expected to be important. In this region, we find a strong impact of the pion-pole term in $\gamma\pi^\pm$ production, and a non-negligible effect for neutral mesons. We also observe a marked dependence of $\gamma\eta'$ photoproduction on two-gluon contributions. This process offers enhanced sensitivity to the shape of the GPDs already at leading-order, while the tested dependence on the meson distribution amplitude and the renormalization scale introduces further theoretical uncertainties, the latter emphasizing the need for next-to-leading-order corrections. Our results provide a concise analytical framework and a numerical baseline for future studies.</description>

      <title>Strangelet Searches from Neutron Stars, Binary Mergers, and Gamma-Ray Bursts with Current and Future Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange quark matter (SQM) is considered a possible true ground state of QCD at high densities. This idea motivates research on exotic compact objects and certain cosmic-ray phenomena. For instance, the remnant HESS J1731-347 contains a low-mass neutron star, about $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ $M_\odot$ and $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km in radius, making it a strong candidate for a strange quark star. Other events, such as GW170817 and GRB 250702B, provide conditions that may favor the formation of strangelets. Strangelets are stable clusters of SQM, potentially created during the phase transition between the 2SC and CFL color-superconducting states. These clusters could generate monochromatic $\gamma$-ray lines in very-high-energy spectra through self-annihilation. This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models. Data from H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT, MAGIC-II, and CTA were used to set limits on spectral features and possible fluxes. Detecting narrow $\gamma$-ray lines will require improved instrument sensitivity. By integrating evidence from multimessenger astrophysics and dense QCD simulations, this study investigates the equations of state for compact stars and explores the potential cosmological influence of SQM.</description>

      <title>New constraints on axion with gamma-ray observations of the Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the upper bounds on the coupling of axion-like particles (ALPs) with photon as a function of the mass by considering axion-photon conversion in the Crab Nebula. Previous studies have not considered the influence of the magnetic field within the Crab Nebula. The magnetic field plays a crucial role through the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process, in which high-energy electrons produce synchrotron radiation that is subsequently up-scattered by the same electrons via inverse Compton scattering to generate gamma rays. Therefore, neglecting the magnetic field in modeling leads to theoretical inconsistencies. In this work, we investigate the significance of the magnetic field effect and demonstrate that even differences in magnetic field modeling can substantially alter the conversion probability. We thus, for the first time, point out that proper consideration of the magnetic field is essential in ALP searches using gamma rays from the Crab Nebula. The resulting constraints reach up to a coupling of $g_{a\gamma \gamma} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{-11} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses in the range $10^{-10} {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-6} {\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>A phenomenological analysis of charmless $B\to PV$ decays in the modified perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the charmless two-body decays of the $B$ meson into a pseudoscalar and a vector meson, referred to as $B\to PV$ decay, within the framework of the modified perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. Based on the conventional PQCD calculations, soft form factors and contributions arising from color-octet quark-antiquark components in the final state are introduced in this study, which involves essentially nonperturbative dynamics. By employing the flavor SU(3) symmetry and its breaking effect, the parameters describing soft contributions are correlated and subsequently reduced into a more concise set of SU(3) parameters. Through a $\chi^2$ analysis procedure applied to the experimental data, these parameters are determined, for which the corresponding theoretical results for the branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries in $B\to PV$ decays are derived. Within this framework, it is demonstrated that the theoretical calculations align well with experimental measurements, thereby offering a solution to several long-standing puzzles. The numerical analysis shows that these soft contributions have significant influence on the theoretical results. Furthermore, more precise experimental data are needed for deeper investigations of the $CP$ asymmetries.</description>

Abstract: We present an implementation of algorithms for the symbolic integration of hyperlogarithms multiplied by rational functions in the computer algebra system FORM. This implementation encompasses cases where hyperlogarithms have rational letters or a rational argument. It complements the previous implementation, HyperInt, in MAPLE by Erik Panzer, utilizing the advantages of FORM in the efficient handling of large symbolic expressions. Among a wide range of applications, this approach enables the computation of many Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of quarkonia production at ultra high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach in high energy QCD, which allows us to calculate the inclusive quarkonia production at ultra high energies. This approach is based on $t$-channel unitarity and on the expressions for dipole densities from the procedure of summing of large Pomeron loops which we have developed in our previous papers. In the framework of this approach we discuss the dependence of quarkonia production on the multiplicity of the accompanying hadrons. In this paper we used the three gluons fusion mechanism for quarkonia production, without assuming the multiplicity dependence of the saturation scale. We found the multiplicity distribution of produced gluon with ( $ \mathcal{P}^{J/\Psi}_n$) and without ($\mathcal{P}^{gluon}_n$) the quarkonia production. It turns out that $ \frac{\mathcal{P}^{J/\Psi}_n}{\mathcal{P}^{gluon}_n} \propto n^2 $ as has been expected and discussed in corresponding publications.</description>

      <title>Is the large uncertainty of $\delta_{CP}$ fundamentally encoded in the neutrino quantum state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</description>

      <title>First determination of fragmentation functions in an exotic-hadron candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there are experimental reports on exotic-hadron candidates, which have different quark configurations from ordinary $q\bar q$ and $qqq$ constituents. However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \ll M_s \sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\bar K$ molecule state at low energies. It sheds light on a new direction in exotic hadron physics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting lepton flavor violation: $\tau$ and meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal type-I seesaw model provides a simple explanation of neutrino flavor oscillations and induces charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV). Despite extensive previous studies, semileptonic cLFV channels remain underexplored. Using updated form factors, decay constants, and oscillation data, we revisit $\tau$ and meson decay channels, performing a systematic comparison across the seesaw parameter space. Surprisingly, we find that decays such as $\tau \to \ell\rho$ can dominate over purely leptonic $\tau$-sector probes, including $\tau\to 3\ell$ and even $\tau\to\ell\,\gamma$, in certain regions. In contrast, heavy-meson decays remain far below experimental sensitivity. Considering global constraints on the seesaw parameters, we derive branching ratios for the relevant cLFV processes and identify those within potential reach of next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards the two-loop electroweak corrections to the Drell-Yan process: the infrared structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the lepton-pair production process in Quantum Electrodynamics. We present the ultraviolet-renormalised and infrared-subtracted finite contribution of the second-order virtual corrections to the inclusive lepton-pair production cross section $u\bar u\to e^+e^-$. The results are obtained within a new computational framework, OCEANN, developed in view of the evaluation of the exact two-loop electroweak virtual corrections to high-energy scattering processes. One of the key methodological features in this approach is the representation of the scattering amplitude with arbitrary precision at every stage of the calculation. The analysis in QED allows us to address the treatment of the infrared structure of the process and it can be easily extended to the complete electroweak Standard Model case. The perfect agreement with the literature, for this subset of corrections, provides a non trivial validation of the general framework.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Extracting GPDs from Exclusive Photon Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new framework for studying generic $2 \to 3$ hard exclusive reactions, referred to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEP), has been introduced to provide a cleaner separation of the underlying physical mechanisms. In this work, we expand this formalism to the case of exclusive real-photon electroproduction off a nucleon, $e(\ell) + N(p) \to e(\ell') + N(p') + \gamma(q')$, which represents the classical channel for accessing generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in nucleons and nuclei. This extension enables a more systematic and physically transparent formulation of the reaction dynamics, paving the way for improved extractions of GPDs from experimental data as compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>$B^+\to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ Excess and DM semi-annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Belle II collaboration announced the observarion of the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar{\nu}$ decay channel for the first time. This decay channel provides a clean signal with high precision in theoretical calculation. However, we encounter $2.8\sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction. To resolve this excess, we study scalar dark matter (DM) model with local discrete $Z_3$ symmetry. Assuming dark $U(1)_X \equiv U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry, this $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken into local discrete $Z_3$ by non-zero vacuum expectation value of dark Higgs boson. Considering dark Higgs mass is $2$GeV, we can explain the recent ${\rm Br} (B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar{\nu})$ excess reported from Belle II collaboration and relic abundance at the same time.</description>

      <title>Chiral phonons in metal-organic frameworks as quantum sensors for the direct detection of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new quantum sensor for dark matter direct detection with sub-eV sensitivity, focusing on several candidate materials that potentially host chiral phonons with large magnetic moments that can be directly read out with an external magnetometer. We focus on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as possible candidate materials for single chiral phonon detection due to their noncentrosymmetric structure, tunability, and the ability to host these excitations in stable acoustic bands. We identify several promising candidates and compare their projected dark matter detection sensitivity for all possible interactions identified within effective field theory. We establish that the expected sensitivity does not depend heavily on the specific choice of the MOF, enabling us to tailor the final material composition to facilitate the magnetic readout. We then propose a prototype setup able to test the direct readout of a chiral phonon sensor with a surface-integrated magnetometer.</description>

      <title>Impact of quark flavor violating SUSY on h(125) decays at future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the CP-even neutral Higgs boson decays $h^0 \to c \bar{c}, b \bar{b}, b \bar{s}, \gamma \gamma, g g$ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with general quark flavor violation (QFV) due to squark generation mixings, identifying the $h^0$ as the Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV. We compute the widths of the $h^0$ decays to $c \bar c, b \bar b, b \bar s$ at full one-loop level. For the $h^0$ decays to $\gamma \gamma$ and $g g$ we compute the widths at NLO QCD level. {\it For the first time}, we perform a systematic MSSM parameter scan for these widths respecting all the relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, such as those from B-meson data, and the 125 GeV Higgs boson data from recent LHC experiments, as well as the limits on Supersymmetric (SUSY) particle (sparticle) masses from the LHC experiments. We also take into account the expected sparticle mass limits from the future HL-LHC experiment in our analysis. {\it In strong contrast to} the usual studies in the MSSM with Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV), we find that the deviations of these MSSM decay widths from the Standard Model (SM) values can be quite sizable and that there are significant correlations among these deviations. All of these sizable deviations in the $h^0$ decays are mainly due to large scharm-stop mixing and large sstrange-sbottom mixing. Such sizable deviations from the SM can be observed at high signal significance in future lepton colliders such as ILC, CLIC, CEPC, FCC-ee and muon collider {\it even after} the failure of SUSY particle discovery at the HL-LHC. In case the deviation pattern shown here is really observed at the lepton colliders, then it would strongly suggest the discovery of QFV SUSY (the MSSM with general QFV).</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD predictions for $W\gamma\gamma$ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triboson production processes play a crucial role in probing the electroweak sector of the Standard Model, as they involve quartic gauge-boson couplings already at the tree level. With these measurements entering the precision era at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), accurate theoretical predictions become indispensable. We present the computation of the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD radiative corrections to the production of a $W$ boson in association with two photons ($W\gamma\gamma$) at the LHC. The calculation is exact, except for the finite part of the two-loop contribution, which is included in the leading-colour approximation. Predictions for the fiducial cross section and selected kinematic distributions are provided at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, under standard experimental selection cuts. In line with observations for other multiboson processes involving direct photons, we find sizable NNLO corrections that enhance the next-to-leading-order predictions by about $23\%$, with residual perturbative uncertainties that can be roughly estimated to be at the $5\%$ level.</description>

      <title>CP Violation in Charmed Meson Decays into Final States with $\eta'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Standard Model predictions for the CP asymmetries of singly-Cabibbo suppressed $D\rightarrow P\eta'$ decays, where $P=K,\pi,\eta$. Our predictions are based on the approximate SU(3)$_F$ symmetry of QCD and include first-order symmetry-breaking effects in a systematic way. The underlying symmetry leads to correlations between different decay modes. To this end we predict the correlations between $ a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D^+\to \pi^+ \eta')$ and $a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D_s^+ \to K^+ \eta')$ as well as $a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D^0\to \pi^0 \eta')$ and $ a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D^0\to \eta \eta')$. Our results can be used to probe the Standard Model with future measurements by LHCb, Belle II and BESIII. At the same time, such future measurements permit the extraction of the key theory parameter related to the ratio of color-suppressed to color-favoured contributions to the decay amplitudes. Future data on both branching ratios and CP asymmetries will automatically improve our predictions and thereby also their sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We compute three-loop corrections to the three-point form factor of the operator $\operatorname{tr}(\phi^2)$ in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. In particular, our result is valid beyond the leading-color limit and will consequently be an important input towards extending the amplitude-bootstrap program beyond the leading-color approximation. We find that our analytic formulae are strikingly compact expressions in terms of integer linear combinations of generalized polylogarithms of weight six.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics is entering a multi-band era with upcoming GW detectors, enabling detailed mapping of the stochastic GW background across vast frequencies. We highlight this potential via a new physics scenario: hybrid topological defects from a two-step phase transition separated by inflation. We develop a general pipeline to analyze experimental exclusions and apply it to this model. The model offers a possible explanation of the pulsar timing array signal at low frequencies, and future experiments (LISA/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope) will confirm or rule it out via the higher-frequency probes, showcasing the power of multi-band constraints.</description>

      <title>Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) algorithm to study Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers. We demonstrate that CVQC allows the simulation of charged particles with orbital angular momentum under the influence of an adiabatically changing $\vec{B}$ field. Although formulated entirely in the CVQC setting, our construction uses only passive linear-optical operations (beam splitters and phase shifts), which act identically in single-photon photonic architectures. This enables experimental realisation on the Quandella Ascella platform, where we observe the Berry's phase phenomenon with interferometric measurement. We also generalise the framework to more rapid non-adiabatic evolution. By concatenating Aharonov-Anandan cycles for opposing magnetic fields we demonstrate that one can engineer a circuit in which dynamical phases and leading non-geometric errors cancel by symmetry, leaving the intrinsically robust geometric phase contribution.</description>

      <title>Periodic gravitational lensing by oscillating boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that oscillating (real-scalar) boson stars can act as strictly periodic gravitational lenses and generically host an \emph{oscillating radial caustic}. Sources near this caustic cross it every half period, producing achromatic phase-locked photometric spikes synchronized with an astrometric wobble, providing a promising target for time-domain astronomy. Event-number estimation indicates a measurable discovery space with current astrometric and high-cadence photometric surveys. These predictions rely only on the dynamics of long-lived real-scalar condensates, therefore offering a clean test of self-gravitating quantum fields in curved spacetime. The framework extends naturally to self-interacting real scalars (including axion-like particles) and to ultralight vector bosons.</description>

      <title>Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</description>

Abstract: On August 17$^{\rm th}$ 2017, observatories worldwide made a landmark detection: gravitational waves and light from a binary neutron star merger. This event revolutionized our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology, and gravitation. In this proceeding of the 2025 International Congress of Basic Science, we describe how it transformed our view of cosmic acceleration (dark energy). The near-simultaneous arrival of light and gravitational waves shows that their speeds agree to within one part in $10^{15}$, excluding large classes of modified gravity theories and interactions between dark energy and matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a precision investigation of smooth quintessential inflation in which a single canonical scalar field unifies the two known phases of cosmic acceleration. Using a CMB-normalized runaway exponential potential, we obtain sharply predictive inflationary observables: a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s = 0.964241$ and an exceptionally suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.48 \times 10^{-5}$ at $N=60$, lying near the optimal region of current Planck+ACT constraints. Remarkably, all observable scales exit the horizon within an extremely narrow field interval $\Delta\phi \simeq 0.03\,M_{\rm Pl}$, tightly linking early and late-time dynamics and reducing theoretical ambiguities. While inflationary tensors remain invisible to CMB B-mode surveys, the subsequent stiff epoch-an intrinsic hallmark of quintessential cosmology-imprints a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background within the discovery reach of future interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO, ALIA, and BBO. Our results demonstrate that this minimal, featureless model not only survives current bounds, but provides concrete, falsifiable predictions across gravitational-wave frequencies spanning over twenty orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES with Skyrme pseudopotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</description>

      <title>The effect of sound speed on the gravitational wave spectrum of first order phase transitions in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions are a promising probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, as many extensions of the standard model result in first-order phase transitions in the early universe, from which the resulting gravitational waves could be detectable with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
  The properties of the phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave spectrum are determined by five key parameters: the nucleation temperature $T_n$, phase transition strength at the nucleation temperature $\alpha_n$, bubble wall speed $v_\text{wall}$, transition rate $\beta$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Of these, the sound speed $c_s$ is determined by the equation of state $p(T,\phi)$. In most studies, the plasma of the early universe has been assumed to be ultrarelativistic and therefore following the bag equation of state with $c_s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.
  In this thesis, the PTtools simulation framework for first-order phase transitions, based on the Sound Shell Model, has been extended to include support for arbitrary equations of state and therefore for a temperature- and phase-dependent sound speed $c_s(T,\phi)$. The thesis also functions as a reference manual for PTtools. The framework has been tested with the constant sound speed model, in which the sound speed is a different constant in each phase. The sound speed has been shown to have a significant effect on the resulting gravitational wave spectrum, especially when changing the sound speed results in a change in the type of the solution. This has laid the groundwork for simulating cosmological phase transitions with realistic equations of state. This will result in in gravitational wave spectra that can be used in the LISA data analysis pipeline to search for the existence and parameters of a first-order phase transition in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: $F(R)$ Palatini gravity provides a robust framework for constructing viable inflationary potentials. In this study, we examine natural inflation and show that its consistency with observational data can be restored when the model is embedded within $F(R)$ Palatini gravity, specifically for $F(R) = R + \alpha R^n$ with $7/4 \lesssim n \leq 2$. For completeness, we also demonstrate that models with $n &gt; 2$ do not yield comparable improvements, achieving partial agreement with the data only in the limit $n \rightarrow 2$.</description>

Abstract: The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are coherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a suppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In this paper, we continue analysis of the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting processes overlap (which is important for understanding corrections to standard treatments of the LPM effect in QCD), avoiding soft-gluon approximations. In particular, this paper analyzes the subtle problem of how to precisely separate overlapping double splitting (e.g.\ overlapping double bremsstrahlung) from the case of consecutive, independent bremsstrahlung (which is the case that would be implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation based solely on single splitting rates). As an example of the method, we consider the rate of real double gluon bremsstrahlung from an initial gluon with various simplifying assumptions (thick media; $\hat q$ approximation; large $N_c$; and neglect for the moment of processes involving 4-gluon vertices) and explicitly compute the correction $\Delta\,d\Gamma/dx\,dy$ due to overlapping formation times.</description>

Abstract: Multi-loop scattering amplitudes are difficult to evaluate due to singularities of the integrals involved, especially with increasing number of loops, external legs, and mass scales. For the first time for hadronic collisions at two loops, we enable the combined numerical integration over loop momentum and phase space by tackling infrared, ultraviolet and threshold singularities simultaneously using local subtractions. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by calculating previously unknown perturbative corrections for processes of interest to the Large Hadron Collider, namely the Nf-part of the finite remainder of the phase-space integrated virtual corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD for the production of up to three massive electroweak vector bosons in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Pulse and Polarization Structures in Axion-Converted X-rays from Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NS's) with their strong magnetic fields and hot dense cores could be powerful probes of axions, a classic benchmark of feebly-coupled new particles, through abundant production of axions with the axion-nucleon coupling and subsequent conversion into X-rays due to the axion-photon coupling. In this article, we point out that the pulsation structures in both the intensity and polarization of X-rays from NS's could provide us additional information about axions and their couplings. We develop new analytical formalisms of pulsation-polarization structure applicable to a wide range of NS's in the axion scenario and argue that they hold in complicated astrophysical environments. As a case study, we apply our formalism to a representative X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Star, RX J1856.6-3754, with an unexpected hard X-ray excess which might be axion-induced. We show with an updated fit that the axion explanation is compatible with both the intensity and pulsation data available, and combining the pulsation data does not shift the posterior by more than $1\,\sigma$. Yet, the preferred parameter space is close to being excluded by other astrophysical constraints. With a 75% reduction of the uncertainties in the pulsation data, we could potentially draw a definite conclusion on the axion-induced X-rays at more than $3\,\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>eV-scale sterile neutrino: A window open to non-unitarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An excess observed in the accelerator neutrino experiments in the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{e}$ channel at high confidence level (CL) has been interpreted as due to eV-scale sterile neutrino(s). But, it has been suffered from the problem of ``appearance-disappearance tension'' at the similarly high CL because the measurements of the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$ channel do not observe the expected event number depletion corresponding to the sterile contribution in the appearance channel. We suggest non-unitarity as a simple and natural way of resolving the tension, which leads us to construct the non-unitary $(3+1)$ model. With reasonable estimation of the $\alpha$ parameters governing non-unitarity, which we argue growing when more sterile states added, we perform an illustrative analysis to illuminate if the tension can be resolved in this model. We have found the unique solution with $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.3$, which is consistent with the (reactors + Ga) data and is stable against variation of the appearance signature. This solution bridges between the two high CL signatures, BEST and LSND-MiniBooNE, and implies a large neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry, given the much less anomaly indicated in the antineutrino sector.</description>

Abstract: A scan of the beam energy across the top quark pair ($\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$) production threshold is part of the program of future Higgs, top, and electroweak factory projects. In this paper, we provide projections for the achievable precision in the top quark mass ($m_\mathrm{t}$), width ($\Gamma_\mathrm{t}$), and Yukawa coupling ($y_\mathrm{t}$) at the electron-positron ($\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). The study includes a detailed assessment of parametric and systematic uncertainties, as well as a rigorous estimate of the effect of point-to-point correlations. We project that $m_\mathrm{t}$ and $\Gamma_\mathrm{t}$ can be determined with an experimental precision of about 6.8 and 11.5 MeV, respectively, when $m_\mathrm{t}$ is defined in the potential-subtracted (PS) scheme. The impact of theoretical uncertainties due to missing higher orders is found to be of about 35 (25) MeV on $m_\mathrm{t}$ ($\Gamma_\mathrm{t}$) at N$^3$LO in non-relativistic QCD. Therefore, improvements in the theoretical accuracy, which is an active area of development, are key to match the achievable experimental precision at a future $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collider. Finally, we explore the prospects for a measurement of $y_\mathrm{t}$ at FCC-ee via a dedicated run above the $\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ production threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Fast Calculation of High-Order Q-Cumulants</title>

Abstract: The method of Q-cumulants has been shown as a powerful tool to study the fine details of the azimuthal anisotropies in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. A new method for the fast calculation of arbitrary order Q-cumulant $v_{n}\{2k\}$ values, based on the partition of a non-negative integer l $\le$ m for calculation of the 2m-particle azimuthal correlations is presented in this paper. Unlike the standard Q-cumulants method in which the calculation of high-order multi-particle calculations is impractical, the newly proposed method enables easy calculation. The validity of the method is proven via a toy model that uses the elliptic power distribution to simulate anisotropic emission of particles. The method enables the study of fine details of the $v_{2}$ distribution, such as higher-order central moments of the $v_{2}$ distribution, as well as the hydrodynamic behavior of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven High-Dimensional Statistical Inference with Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crucial to many measurements at the LHC is the use of correlated multi-dimensional information to distinguish rare processes from large backgrounds, which is complicated by the poor modeling of many of the crucial backgrounds in Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we introduce HI-SIGMA, a method to perform unbinned high-dimensional statistical inference with data-driven background distributions. In contradistinction to many applications of Simulation Based Inference in High Energy Physics, HI-SIGMA relies on generative ML models, rather than classifiers, to learn the signal and background distributions in the high-dimensional space. These ML models allow for interpretable inference while also incorporating model errors and other sources of systematic uncertainties. We showcase this methodology on a simplified version of a di-Higgs measurement in the $bb\gamma\gamma$ final state, where the di-photon resonance allows for background interpolation from sidebands into the signal region. We demonstrate that HI-SIGMA provides improved sensitivity as compared to standard classifier-based methods, and that systematic uncertainties can be straightforwardly incorporated by extending methods which have been used for histogram based analyses.</description>

      <title>Application of the 3-Loop FlexibleEFTHiggs Method to the MSSM and the NMSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an extensive analysis of the light CP-even Higgs boson pole mass in the MSSM and its dependencies on various parameters based on the 3-loop FlexibleEFTHiggs hybrid calculation which is implemented and publicly avaiable since recently in FlexibleSUSY. Our focus lies on the study of the robustness of the approach in scenarios of highly non-degenerate SUSY mass spectra. Also, we present an improved Higgs mass calculation in the NMSSM based on the same approach, which is published in the new version 2.9.0 of FlexibleSUSY as well. The calculation provides a treatment in the full-model parametrization, leading to an advantageous resummation of QCD-enhanced terms in the stop-mixing parameter and includes important 2-loop contributions as well as 3-loop QCD contributions in the MSSM limit. We assess the reliability of this new calculation by applying it to several distinct NMSSM scenarios. In this context, special attention is devoted to the estimation of NMSSM-specific theory uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Gluon Distributions in the Pion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a light-front model for the pion that explicitly incorporates the gluonic degree of freedom. In this framework, high-energy scattering off the pion is described by an active gluon, while the remaining constituents are treated as a spectator system with an effective mass. The mass spectrum and light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion are determined by solving two Schr\"odinger-like equations derived from quantum chromodynamics: the light-front holographic equation in the chiral limit and the 't~Hooft equation. Using the resulting LFWFs, we compute the gluon distributions within pion, including the parton distribution functions in comparison with the available global fits, generalized parton distributions, and transverse momentum-dependent distributions. The present analysis is restricted to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) domain of the pion's gluon GPD, without explicit construction of the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage (ERBL) region. Consequently, the polynomiality condition for full Mellin moments is not satisfied by construction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the obtained LFWFs provide a good description of the gravitational form factors of pion when compared with the recent lattice QCD results.</description>

      <title>The Yukawa potential of a non-homogeneous sphere, with new limits on an ultralight boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely weak long-range forces may lead to apparent violations of the Equivalence Principle. The final MICROSCOPE result, leading at 95 % c.l. to $|\delta| &lt; 4.5 \times 10^{-15}$ or $6.5 \times 10^{-15}$ for a positive or negative E\"otv\"os parameter $\delta$, requires taking into account the spin of the mediator, and the sign of $\Delta (Q/A_r)_{\rm{Ti-Pt}}$ ($Q$ denoting the new charge involved). A coupling to $B-L$ or $B$ should verify $|g_{B-L}|&lt;1.1 \times 10^{-25}$ or $|g_{B}| &lt; 8 \times 10^{-25}$, for a spin-1 mediator of mass $m &lt; 10^{-14}$ eV$/c^2$, with slightly different limits of $1.3 \times 10^{-25}$ or $\,6.6 \times 10^{-25}$ in the spin-0 case.
  The limits increase with $m$, in a way which depends on the density distribution within the Earth. This involves an hyperbolic form factor, expressed through a bilateral Laplace transform as $\Phi(x=mR)= \langle\,\sinh mr/mr \,\rangle$, related by analytic continuation to the Earth form factor $\Phi(ix)= \langle \,\sin mr/mr \,\rangle $. It may be expressed as $\Phi(x) = \frac{3}{x^2}\, (\cosh x - \frac{\sinh x}{x}) \times\, \bar\rho(x)/\rho_0\,$, where $\bar\rho(x)$ is an effective density, decreasing from the average $\rho_0$ at $m=0$ down to the density at the periphery.
  We give general integral or multishell expressions of $\Phi(x)$, evaluating it, and $\bar\rho(x)$, in a simplified 5-shell model. $\Phi(x)$ may be expanded as $\, \sum \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n+1)!} \frac{\langle \,r^{2n}\,\rangle}{R^{2n}}
  \simeq 1 + .0827\ x^2 + .00271 \ x^4 + 4.78 \times 10^{-5}\,x^6 + 5.26\times 10^{-7}\, x^8 +\ ... \ $, absolutely convergent for all $x$ and potentially useful up to $x\approx 5$. The coupling limits increase at large $x$ like $mR \ e^{mz/2}/\sqrt{1+mr}$ ($z=r-R$ being the satellite altitude), getting multiplied by $\simeq 1.9,\ 34$, or $1.2\times 10^9$, for $m = 10^{-13},\ 10^{-12}$ or $10^{-11}$ eV$/c^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Constraining the CP4-invariant three-Higgs-doublet model via top quark decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP4 3HDM is a peculiar three-Higgs-doublet model in which a single symmetry leads to tight constraints on the scalar and Yukawa sectors. In this models, tree-level flavor-changing neutral couplings are unavoidable; however, as previously shown, their contributions to neutral meson oscillations can be suppressed. Here, we explore the remaining quark flavor violating effects, which give rise to the top quark decays to light scalars, including the 125 GeV Higgs boson $h_{SM}$, as well as the magnitude of the $h_{SM} t\bar t$ coupling. Utilizing the recently developed scanning procedure, in which observables are used as input, we narrow down the viable options to a unique CP4-invariant Yukawa sector capable of satisfying all meson oscillation and top quark constraints. We present benchmark models that feature neutral or charged Higgs bosons lighter than the top quark, and we look forward to testing them further at the LHC and through flavor physics observables.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ Form Factors with the Heavy Quark Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent publications by three lattice QCD collaborations have provided an unprecedented wealth of theoretical predictions for the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors, for spectator flavours $q=u/d$ and $q=s$. We analyse these predictions within the framework of the heavy-quark expansion (HQE) to order $\alpha_s$, $1/m_b$, and $1/m_c^2$. For the first time, our analysis imposes unitarity bounds for all of the $\bar{B}_q^{(*)} \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors; this includes newly identified tensor form factors arising in $\bar{B}_q^*\to D_q^{(*)}$. This enables us to treat all form factors in the same fashion. At the level of our present analysis, the inclusion of the tensor bounds is not yet constraining the HQE parameter space. We find the lattice QCD results to be well compatible with each other in a joint HQE fit as well as with QCD sum rule estimates that were used in previous HQE analyses. This is in contrast to the strong variability of the posterior predictions, in particular of the form factors ratios $R_0$ and $R_2$. Using the posterior distributions of our HQE analysis, we provide predictions for angular observables and LFU ratios in the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}\ell^-\bar{\nu}$ decays.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the contribution of the QCD $\bar \theta$ term to the CP violating pion-nucleon couplings and the nucleon electric dipole moment in a combined large-$N_c$ and chiral perturbation theory framework. In particular, we approach this issue through the emergent spin-flavor symmetry of the baryon sector at large but finite $N_c$. We obtain good agreement with previous analyses for the pion-nucleon couplings and show that the large-$N_c$ framework indicates that tree-level contributions to the electric dipole moment possibly play a dominant role. The spin-flavor symmetry also enables us to provide novel constraints on CP violating pion-$\Delta$ couplings as well as the $\Delta$ electric dipole moment and $\Delta N$ transition moment.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of self-interaction strength on the formation and scale of turbulent vortex structures during the merger of Bose stars, using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equations. We find that vortex formation is a universal outcome of soliton mergers, with the vortex size strongly dependent on the self-interaction coupling parameter $g$. Through analysis of velocity correlations, kinetic energy spectra, and vorticity distributions, we conclude that for repulsive self-interaction, the vortex region expands as self-interaction strength increases; conversely, for attractive self-interaction, the vortex region shrinks as self-interaction strength increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed, for the first time, a complete next-to-leading order QCD calculation for processes involving fully charm tetraquark states, revealing that the renormalization constant of the color-singlet four charm quark operator is exactly unity at this order. By resumming over various gluon radiation effects, we have improved the precision of their hadroproduction cross-section to the order of ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^5)$. Through symmetry analysis, we investigated the possible quark configurations of the fully charm tetraquark and expanded its states in the color symmetry-antisymmetry basis. By combining LHCb data on the total cross section of the exotic hadron X(6900) and CMS measurements of its spin-parity, we extracted the non-perturbative but universal long-distance matrix elements. The rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are also predicted, which await further experimental verification.</description>

      <title>CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of inflation and freeze-in dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of $\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.</description>

      <title>Radiative Decays of Vector Mesons with Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadronic electromagnetic form factors and radiative decay properties offer a crucial window into the nonperturbative dynamics of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we employ the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) method to systematically investigate the M1 radiative decay of vector mesons. Our study covers processes including $K^{*-}\rightarrow K^-\gamma$, $D^*\rightarrow D\gamma$, $B^*\rightarrow B\gamma$, $D^{*+}_s\rightarrow D^+_s\gamma$, and $B_s^*\rightarrow B_s\gamma$, and further extends to the excited charmonium state $\psi(2S)$. Our calculations yield decay widths for $K^*$ and $\psi(2S)$ that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. For the charm and bottom meson decays, where precise measurements are lacking, we provide theoretical predictions and compare them with other theoretical approaches. Most notably, our analysis reveals a universal linear dependence of the decay width on a function A(x) in the logarithmic coordinate system, which originates from the two-body decay dynamics and the ratio of the initial and final state decay constants. This relationship holds for the ground state $V \rightarrow P \gamma $ processes here and suggests a broader applicability to radiative decays of ground-state vector mesons.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.</description>

      <title>Has ACT measured radiative corrections to the tree-level Higgs-like inflation?</title>

Abstract: Starobinsky inflation and nonminimally coupled (NMC) Higgs inflation have been among the most favored models of the early Universe, as their predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ fall comfortably within the constraints set by Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, new results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a quartic NMC inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings NMC inflation into better agreement with ACT observations. The effect is even more significant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the modified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric case. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and gravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light of new data.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15382</link>

Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Perfect spinfluid: A divergence-type approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of non-dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that incorporates spin degrees of freedom into the divergence-type theory framework. Due to the divergence-type structure, it is straightforward to enforce non-linear causality and symmetric hyperbolicity of the equations of motion, ensuring local well-posedness of the initial-value problem and stability of the theory. Furthermore, in a specific realization based on spin kinetic theory, we prove that the equations of motion remain non-linearly causal and symmetric-hyperbolic to all orders in the spin potential, provided a specific thermodynamic constraint is satisfied. This framework can be applied for numerical simulations to study the dynamics of spin-polarized fluids, such as the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Momentum expansions in finite-density perturbative calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Learning to Validate Generative Models: a Goodness-of-Fit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning-based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman--Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end model, known as FlowSim, developed to generate high-energy physics collision events. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.</description>

      <title>Coupling between gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations on Kerr Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous Schwarzschild metric-based studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Large Scale White Noise and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of white noise on large scales is a generic property of the dynamics of physical systems described by local non-linear partial differential equations. Non-linearities prevent the small scale dynamics from being erased by smoothing. Unresolved small scale dynamics act as an uncorrelated (white or Poissonian) noise (seemingly stochastic but actually deterministic) contribution to large scale dynamics. This white noise exists even when the dynamics is very nearly linear. In cases where the power spectrum is sub-Poissonian on large scales, this noise will dominate on the largest scale power no matter the amplitude of the inhomogeneities. Such is the case in the standard model of cosmology, where the primordial density power spectrum is expected to have an almost Harrison-Zel'dovich, $P[k]\sim k$, spectrum on a much broader range of scales than can be observed. Even though linear gravitational evolution dominates non-linear corrections by a factor $\sim10^5$, the non-observation of white noise on the Hubble scale precludes the extrapolation of this power law below the comoving $1\,$pc scale. More generally, observation or non-observation of large scale white noise provides a powerful probe of the universe on very small scales in the early early universe. Gravitational radiation, phase transitions, vorticity, and running of the spectral index are all phenomena that can be probed with large scale white noise. Large scale white noise is a non-optional feature of all cosmological models but one which has not heretofore been appreciated.</description>
