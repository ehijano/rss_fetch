      <title>Spin Freezing in Oscillator Ising Machines: When Second Harmonic Injection Impedes Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second harmonic injection (SHI) has emerged as a critical mechanism in enabling networks of coupled oscillators to function as Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs), capable of minimizing the Ising Hamiltonian. While SHI facilitates phase binarization essential for mapping oscillator phases to spin states, we demonstrate that it can also induce a previously unreported phenomenon -- spin freezing -- where oscillator spins are unable to transition between spin states, even when such a transition can reduce the Ising energy. This freezing effect can impair the analog dynamics of the OIM, preventing it from reaching lower-energy spin configurations. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the onset of spin freezing is highly sensitive to the initial phase configuration of the oscillators. Contrary to conventional practice, which favors random initialization, we find that initializing all oscillators at specific phase values ($\phi = \pi$ or $\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$) delays the onset of spin freezing and consistently yields higher-quality solutions. These findings point to the need to carefully engineer the SHI for optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Molecular polaritons dynamics in realistic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large number of degrees of freedom involved in polaritonic chemistry processes considerably restricts the systems that can be described by any ab initio approach, due to the resulting high computational cost. Semiclassical methods that treat light classically offer a promising route for overcoming these limitations. In this work, we present a new implementation that combines the numerical propagation of Maxwell's equations to simulate realistic cavities with quantum electron dynamics at the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) theory level. This implementation allows for the simulation of a large number of molecules described at the atomistic level, interacting with cavity modes obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. By mimicking experimental setups, our approach enables the calculation of transmission spectra, in which we observe the corresponding polaritonic signals. In addition, we have access to local information, revealing complex responses of individual molecules that depend on the number, geometry, position, and orientation of the molecules inside the cavity.</description>

      <title>High-throughput superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions through density of states rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First principles computational methods can predict the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of conventional superconductors through the electron-phonon spectral function. Full convergence of this quantity requires Brillouin zone integration on very dense grids, presenting a bottleneck to high-throughput screening for high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ systems. In this work, we show that an electron-phonon spectral function calculated at low cost on a coarse grid yields accurate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions, provided the function is rescaled to correct for the inaccurate value of the density of states at the Fermi energy on coarser grids. Compared to standard approaches, the method converges rapidly and improves the accuracy of predictions for systems with sharp features in the density of states. This approach can be directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows, enabling the rapid identification of promising candidates that might otherwise be overlooked.</description>

      <title>Finite density nuclear matter and neutron stars in hard-wall AdS/QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of nuclear matter, equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars and its mass-radius relation in a hard-wall AdS/QCD model by regarding baryons as solitonic configurations in gauge fields. Compared with previous approaches, we employ a different homogeneous approximation that takes into account the equations of motion for the pure gauge fields. By choosing appropriate parameters, we realize a chiral phase transition within the baryonic phase, where the chiral condensate decreases with the baryon chemical potential, until it reaches zero -- chiral symmetry is restored. In addition, independent of the existence of chiral phase transition, we also find that the speed of sound converges to the conformal limit at the density relevant to cores of massive stars but the trace of energy-momentum tensor does not vanish which indicates the pseudoconformal structure and intrinsic manifestation of scale symmetry in compact star matter. Through calculations, we obtain an equation of state that is more tightly constrained than previous works, and the resulting mass-radius relation of neutron stars is consistent with current observations.</description>

      <title>Locally tuned hydrodynamics of active polymer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ mesoscopic simulations to study active polymers in a solvent via multi-particle collision dynamics. We investigate linear chains in which either the head or tail monomer exerts an active force, directed away from or towards its neighbor, respectively, while the remaining monomers are passive. We find that, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the active monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic properties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it, straightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as activity-induced stiffening. In contrast, an active tail pushes into the chain, causing crumpling. This leads to faster decorrelation of the polymer backbone over time, rendering the active motion less persistent. These effects occur regardless of whether hydrodynamic interactions are included or not. Hydrodynamics is included by the imposition of a local counter-force in the surrounding fluid, as opposed to distributing the former equally to all fluid elements. By specifying the position of this counterforce onto the fluid, we can tune the hydrodynamic flow fields of the active polymers being both contractile and extensile. Interestingly, the emerging pusher- and puller flow fields are strongly influenced by the force propagation inside the polymer chain.</description>

      <title>Automated discovery of finite volume schemes using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Lattice vacancy migration barriers in Fe-Ni alloys, and why Ni atoms diffuse slowly: An ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mobility of both Fe and Ni atoms in ferromagnetic $\textrm{Fe}_x \textrm{Ni}_{1-x}$ alloys ($0.4 \leq x \leq 0.6$) is investigated within the framework of ab initio electronic structure calculations, using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to accurately quantify energetic barriers to lattice vacancy migration. Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as the atomically ordered, tetragonal $\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure. Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys.</description>

      <title>Antenna Q-Factor Topology Optimization with Auxiliary Edge Resistivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel bi-level topology optimization strategy within the method-of-moments paradigm. The proposed approach utilizes an auxiliary variables called edge resistivities related to the Rao-Wilton-Glisson method-of-moments basis functions, for a definition of a fast local optimization algorithm. The local algorithm combines automatic differentiation with adaptive gradient descent. A Bayesian optimization scheme is applied on top of the local algorithm to search for an optimum position of the delta-gap feeding and optimizer hyperparameters. The strength of the algorithm is demonstrated on Q-factor minimization for electrically small antennas. Auxiliary edge resistivity topology optimization outperforms current state-of-the-art topology optimization methods, including material density-based approaches and memetic schemes, in terms of convergence. However, due to the nature of gradient descent, careful tuning of the optimizer hyperparameters is required. Furthermore, the proposed method solves the known binarization issue. Two designs that achieved self-resonance and approached the Q-factor lower bound were further assessed in CST Microwave Studio.</description>

      <title>Monitoring, assessment and numerical analysis of the masonry bridge pier defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper thoroughly analyses the significant cracking on the newly refurbished masonry bridge pier in Lovosice. The cracks of width up to 15 mm appeared shortly after the reconstruction of the bridge and were the subject of a detailed assessment. First, a monitoring system was mounted to analyse the behaviour during the year and the dependency on the temperature. Next, a dive inspection was done in order to evaluate the conditions under the water. The next step was to make a diagnostics survey, based on the drilling, endoscopic tests and water pressure tests. Based on the results, several detailed numerical models were created in order to analyse the pier behaviour and conduct a parametric study to investigate various factors, leading to the defects. The numerical models covered the complex geometry of the pier, consisting of the inner poor concrete core and outer shell from sandstone masonry blocks. The above-described procedure revealed the causes of the defects and also recommended the proper strengthening of the pier.</description>

      <title>Global Forecasting of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Neural Weather Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning, Neural Weather Models (NeWMs) have emerged as competent medium-range NWP emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)-among the most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human activities-are challenging to forecast, as extrema like wind gusts, used as proxies for TC intensity, are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent, preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes. Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight, tracking-independent post-processing framework, our approach improves the accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their democratization.</description>

      <title>High-temperature series expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2 and 1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under {https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE}. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>
