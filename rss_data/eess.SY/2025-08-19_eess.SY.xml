      <title>Matrix Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the control barrier function framework by replacing scalar-valued functions with matrix-valued ones. Specifically, we develop barrier conditions for safe sets defined by matrix inequalities -- both semidefinite and indefinite. Matrix inequalities can be used to describe a richer class of safe sets, including nonsmooth ones. The safety filters constructed from our proposed matrix control barrier functions via semidefinite programming (CBF-SDP) are shown to be continuous. Our matrix formulation naturally provides a continuous safety filter for Boolean-based control barrier functions, notably for disjunctions (OR), without relaxing the safe set. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with applications in drone network connectivity maintenance and nonsmooth obstacle avoidance, both in simulations and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Control of a commercial vehicle by a tetraplegic human using a bimanual brain-computer interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) read neural signals directly from the brain to infer motor planning and execution. However, the implementation of this technology has been largely limited to laboratory settings, with few real-world applications. We developed a bimanual BCI system to drive a vehicle in both simulated and real-world environments. We demonstrate that an individual with tetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts at least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a simulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group. This BCI participant, living in California, could also remotely drive a Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle in Michigan. Our first teledriving task relied on cursor control for speed and steering in a closed urban test facility. However, the final BCI system added click control for full-stop braking and thus enabled bimanual cursor-and-click control for both simulated driving through a virtual town with traffic and teledriving through an obstacle course without traffic in the real world. We also demonstrate the safety and feasibility of BCI-controlled driving. This first-of-its-kind implantable BCI application not only highlights the versatility and innovative potentials of BCIs but also illuminates the promising future for the development of life-changing solutions to restore independence to those who suffer catastrophic neurological injury.</description>

      <title>Co-Investment with Payoff-Sharing Mechanism for Cooperative Decision-Making in Network Design Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network-based systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users and the overall system. This paper explores cooperative mechanisms that can simultaneously benefit both operators and users. We address this challenge using a game-theoretical framework that integrates both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. In the non-cooperative stage, we propose a network design game in which subnetwork decision-makers strategically design local infrastructures. In the cooperative stage, co-investment with payoff-sharing mechanism is developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct case studies on the Sioux Falls network and real-world public transport networks in Zurich and Winterthur, Switzerland. Our evaluation considers impacts on environmental sustainability, social welfare, and economic efficiency. The proposed framework provides a foundation for improving interdependent networked systems by enabling strategic cooperation among self-interested operators.</description>

      <title>Design of MIMO Lur'e oscillators via dominant system theory with application in multi-agent rhythm synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new design framework for dynamic output-feedback controllers for Lur'e oscillation in a multiple-input multiple-output setting. We first revisit and extend dominant system theory to state-dependent rates, with the goal of deriving conditions based on linear matrix inequalities. Then, we introduce a separation principle for Lur'e oscillator design, which allows for the independent design of a state-feedback oscillator and an observer. Our proposed control synthesis is demonstrated through the rhythm synchronization in multi-agent systems, illustrating how networks of stable, heterogeneous linear agents can be driven into phase-locked rhythmic behavior.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Approach to Green-Wave Theory Applied to Traffic Signal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travel on long arterials with signalized intersections can be inefficient if not coordinated properly. As the number of signals increases, coordination becomes more challenging and traditional progression schemes tend to break down. Long progressions save travel time and fuel, reduce pollution and traffic accidents by providing a smoother flow of traffic. This paper introduces a green-wave theory that can be applied to a network of intersecting arterial roads. It enables uninterrupted flow on arbitrary long signalized arterials using a Road-to-Traveler-Feedback Device. The approach is modelled after Euclid. We define concepts such as RGW-roads (roads where vehicles traveling at the recommended speed make all traffic signals), green-arrows (representing vehicle platoons), real nodes (representing signalized intersections where RGW-roads intersect) and virtual nodes, green-wave speed, blocks, etc. - the analogue of Euclid's postulates. We then use geometric reasoning to deduce results: green-arrow lengths have a maximum value, are restricted to discrete lengths, and green-arrow laws of motion imply that select existing arterial roads can be converted to RGW-roads. The signal timings and offsets that are produced have been shown to be effective using a simulation model developed previously called RGW-SIM.</description>

      <title>A layered smart sensing platform for physiologically informed human-exoskeleton interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable exoskeletons offer transformative potential to assist mobility across diverse user groups with reduced muscle strength or other forms of impaired mobility. Yet, their deployment beyond laboratory settings remains constrained by sensing systems able to fully capture users' physiological and biomechanical states in real time. We introduce a soft, lightweight smart leg sleeve with anatomically inspired layered multimodal sensing, integrating textile-based surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes, ultrasensitive textile strain sensors, and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Each sensing modality targets a distinct physiological layer: IMUs track joint kinematics at the skeletal level, sEMG monitors muscle activation at the muscular level, and strain sensors detect skin deformation at the cutaneous level. Together, these sensors provide real-time perception to support three core objectives: controlling personalized assistance, optimizing user effort, and safeguarding against injury risks. The system is skin-conformal, mechanically compliant, and seamlessly integrated with a custom exoskeleton (&lt;20 g total sensor and electronics weight). We demonstrate: (1) accurate ankle joint moment estimation (RMSE = 0.13 Nm/kg), (2) real-time classification of metabolic trends (accuracy = 97.1%), and (3) injury risk detection within 100 ms (recall = 0.96), all validated on unseen users using a leave-one-subject-out protocol. This work demonstrates a lightweight, multimodal sensing architecture for next-generation human-exoskeleton interaction in controlled and semi-structured walking scenarios, with potential for scaling to broader exoskeleton applications towards intelligent, responsive, and personalized wearable robotics.</description>

      <title>Monotone Neural Control Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a neurosymbolic framework for synthesizing and verifying safety controllers in high-dimensional monotone dynamical systems using only linear sample complexity, without requiring explicit models or conservative Lipschitz bounds. The approach combines the expressiveness of neural networks with the rigor of symbolic reasoning via barrier certificates, functional analogs of inductive invariants that formally guarantee safety. Prior data-driven methods often treat dynamics as black-box models, relying on dense state-space discretization or Lipschitz overapproximations, leading to exponential sample complexity. In contrast, monotonicity -- a pervasive structural property in many real-world systems -- provides a symbolic scaffold that simplifies both learning and verification. Exploiting order preservation reduces verification to localized boundary checks, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a tractable, low-dimensional one. Barrier certificates are synthesized using monotone neural networks -- architectures with embedded monotonicity constraints -- trained via gradient-based optimization guided by barrier conditions. This enables scalable, formally sound verification directly from simulation data, bridging black-box learning and formal guarantees within a unified neurosymbolic framework. Empirical results on three large-scale benchmarks -- a 1,000-dimensional freeway traffic model, a 50-dimensional urban traffic network, and a 13,000-dimensional power grid -- demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach in real-world, safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Fundamental Trade-Off Between Age of Information and Throughput in Unreliable Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the fundamental trade-off between throughput and Age of Information (AoI) in wireless networks where multiple devices transmit status updates to a central base station over unreliable channels. To address the complexity introduced by stochastic transmission successes, we propose the throughput-AoI capacity region, which defines all feasible throughput-AoI pairs achievable under any scheduling policy. Using a second-order approximation that incorporates both mean and temporal variance, we derive an outer bound and a tight inner bound for the throughput-AoI capacity region. Furthermore, we propose a simple and low complexity scheduling policy and prove that it achieves every interior point within the tight inner bound. This establishes a systematic and theoretically grounded framework for the joint optimization of throughput and information freshness in practical wireless communication scenarios.
  To validate our theoretical framework and demonstrate the utility of the throughput-AoI capacity region, extensive simulations are implemented. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed policy significantly outperforms conventional methods across various practical network optimization scenarios. The findings highlight our approach's effectiveness in optimizing both throughput and AoI, underscoring its applicability and robustness in practical wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control with Set-Point Tracking and Linear-like Closed-loop Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of set-point tracking for a discrete-time plant with unknown plant parameters belonging to a convex and compact uncertainty set. We carry out parameter estimation for an associated auxiliary plant, and a pole-placement-based control law is employed. We prove that this adaptive controller provides desirable linear-like closed-loop behavior which guarantees a bound consisting of: exponential decay with respect to the initial condition, a linear-like convolution bound with respect to the exogenous inputs, and a constant scaled by the square root of the constant in the denominator of the parameter estimator update law. This implies that the system has a bounded gain. Moreover, asymptotic tracking is also proven when the disturbance is constant.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Curved Electrode Configurations for Enhanced Sensitivity in 1-Axis MEMS Accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analytical and simulation-based study of curved electrode geometries for enhancing the sensitivity of MEMS capacitive accelerometers. Expressions for the capacitance between a planar movable electrode and six distinct fixed electrode profiles (biconvex, biconcave, concavo-convex, convexo-concave, plano-convex, and plano-concave) are derived, enabling direct calculation of differential gain and sensitivity as functions of electrode curvature and gap displacement. These analytical models are then rigorously validated using finite element simulations performed using COMSOL Multiphysics under identical bias and boundary conditions. The simulation results demonstrate agreement with the analytical results with a deviation of less than 7% in all configurations. The results also reveal that biconvex curved electrodes yield the greatest sensitivity improvement over the planar electrodes, with sensitivity monotonically increasing with arc length, while concave and plano-concave designs exhibit reduced performance. The concavo-convex and convexo-concave configurations furthermore introduce polarity inversion in the output voltage, offering additional design flexibility. Importantly, these sensitivity enhancements are achieved without any change in the overall volumetric dimensions of the device or the proofmass dimensions of the module for achieving higher-resolution inertial sensing.</description>

      <title>Efficient and accurate solution of wind-integrated optimal power flow based on enhanced second-order cone relaxation with rolling cutting plane technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large-scale renewable energy sources, such as wind power, poses significant challenges for the optimal operation of power systems owing to their inherent uncertainties. This paper proposes a solution framework for wind-integrated optimal power flow (OPF) that leverages an enhanced second-order cone relaxation (SOCR), supported by a rolling cutting plane technique. Initially, the wind generation cost, arising from discrepancies between scheduled and actual wind power outputs, is meticulously modeled using a Gaussian mixture model based on historical wind power data. This modelled wind generation cost is subsequently incorporated into the objective function of the conventional OPF problem. To achieve the efficient and accurate solution for the wind-integrated OPF, effectively managing the constraints associated with AC power flow equations is essential. In this regard, a SOCR, combined with a second-order Taylor series expansion, is employed to facilitate the convex approximation of the AC power flow equations. Additionally, a warm-start strategy, grounded in a proposed rolling cutting plane technique, is devised to reduce relaxation errors and enhance computational efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution framework are demonstrated across various case studies. Specifically, the influence of wind power cost is also examined, further highlighting the practical implications of the proposed solution framework.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quantification and visualization of resilience metrics of power distribution system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven approach for quantifying the resilience of distribution power grids to extreme weather events using two key metrics: (a) the number of outages and (b) restoration time. The method leverages historical outage records maintained by power utilities and weather measurements collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to evaluate resilience across a utility's service territory. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, outage events are systematically extracted from the outage records by temporally and spatially aggregating coincident component outages. In the second stage, weather zones across the service territory are delineated using a Voronoi polygon approach, based on the locations of NOAA weather sensors. Finally, data-driven models for outage fragility and restoration time are developed for each weather zone. These models enable the quantification and visualization of resilience metrics under varying intensities of extreme weather events. The proposed method is demonstrated using real-world data from a US distribution utility, located in Indianapolis, focused on wind- and precipitation-related events. The dataset spans two decades and includes over 160,000 outage records.</description>

      <title>A One-Class Explainable AI Framework for Identification of Non-Stationary Concurrent False Data Injections in Nuclear Reactor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition of next generation advanced nuclear reactor systems from analog to fully digital instrumentation and control will necessitate robust mechanisms to safeguard against potential data integrity threats. One challenge is the real-time characterization of false data injections, which can mask sensor signals and potentially disrupt reactor control systems. While significant progress has been made in anomaly detection within reactor systems, potential false data injections have been shown to bypass conventional linear time-invariant state estimators and failure detectors based on statistical thresholds. The dynamic, nonlinear, multi-variate nature of sensor signals, combined with inherent noise and limited availability of real-world training data, makes the characterization of such threats and more importantly their differentiation from anticipated process anomalies particularly challenging. In this paper, we present an eXplainable AI (XAI) framework for identifying non-stationary concurrent replay attacks in nuclear reactor signals with minimal training data. The proposed framework leverages progress on recurrent neural networks and residual analysis coupled with a modified SHAP algorithm and rule-based correlations. The recurrent neural networks are trained only on normal operational data while for residual analysis we introduce an adaptive windowing technique to improve detection accuracy. We successfully benchmarked this framework on a real-world dataset from Purdue's nuclear reactor (PUR-1). We were able to detect false data injections with accuracy higher than 0.93 and less than 0.01 false positives, differentiate from expected process anomalies, and to identify the origin of the falsified signals.</description>

      <title>Sspherical sailing omnidirectional rover (SSailOR): wind tunnel experimental setup and results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, instrumentation, and experimental procedures used to test the Spherical Sailing Omnidirectional Rover (SSailOR) in a controlled wind tunnel environment. The SSailOR is a wind-powered autonomous rover. This concept is motivated by the growing need for persistent and sustainable robotic systems in applications such as planetary exploration, Arctic observation, and military surveillance. SSailOR uses wind propulsion via onboard sails to enable long-duration mobility with minimal energy consumption. The spherical design simplifies mechanical complexity while enabling omnidirectional movement. Experimental tests were conducted to validate dynamic models and assess the aerodynamic performance of the rover under various configurations and environmental conditions. As a result, this design requires a co-design approach. Details of the mechanical structure, sensor integration, electronics, data acquisition system, and test parameters are presented in this paper. In addition, key observations are made that are relevant to the design optimization for further development of the rover.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Planning of Spatially-Resolved Battery Storage Systems in Renewable-Dominant Grids Under Weather Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing energy transition is significantly increasing the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems; however, their intermittency and variability pose substantial challenges, including load shedding and system congestion. This study examines the role of the battery storage system (BSS) in mitigating these challenges by balancing power supply and demand. We optimize the location, size, and type of batteries using a two-stage stochastic program, with the second stage involving hourly operational decisions over an entire year. Unlike previous research, we incorporate the comprehensive technical and economic characteristics of battery technologies. The New York State (NYS) power system, currently undergoing a significant shift towards increased RES generation, serves as our case study. Using available load and weather data from 1980-2019, we account for the uncertainty of both load and RES generation through a sample average approximation approach. Our findings indicate that BSS can reduce renewable curtailment by 34% and load shedding by 21%, contributing to a more resilient power system in achieving NYS 2030 energy targets. Furthermore, the cost of employing BSS for the reduction of load shedding and RES curtailment does not increase linearly with additional capacity, revealing a complex relationship between costs and renewable penetration. This study provides valuable insights for the strategic BSS deployment to achieve a cost-effective and reliable power system in the energy transition as well as the feasibility of the NYS 2030 energy targets.</description>

      <title>DCT-MARL: A Dynamic Communication Topology-Based MARL Algorithm for Connected Vehicle Platoon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vehicular communication and autonomous driving technologies, connected vehicle platoon has emerged as a promising approach to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety. Reliable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is critical to achieving efficient cooperative control. However, in real-world traffic environments, V2V links may suffer from time-varying delay and packet loss, leading to degraded control performance and even safety risks. To mitigate the adverse effects of non-ideal communication, this paper proposes a Dynamic Communication Topology based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DCT-MARL) algorithm for robust cooperative platoon control. Specifically, the state space is augmented with historical control action and delay to enhance robustness against communication delay. To mitigate the impact of packet loss, a multi-key gated communication mechanism is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the communication topology based on the correlation between agents and their current communication status.Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCT-MARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of string stability and driving comfort, validating its superior robustness and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of the Newton-Raphson Controller for a Class of Differentially Flat Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newton-Raphson Controller, established on the output prediction and the Newton-Raphson algorithm, is shown to be effective in a variety of control applications. Although the stability condition of the controller for linear systems has already been established, such condition for nonlinear systems remains unexplored. In this paper, we study the stability of the Newton-Raphson controller for a class of differentially flat nonlinear systems in the context of output regulation and tracking control. For output regulation, we prove that the controlled system is stable within a neighborhood of the origin if the corresponding flat system and output predictor satisfy a verifiable stability criterion. A semi-quantitative analysis is conducted to determine the measure of the domain of attraction. For tracking control, we prove that the controller is capable of driving the outputs to the external reference signals using a specific selection of controller parameters. Simulation results show that the controller achieves regulation and tracking respectively on the inverted pendulum and the kinematic bicycle, suggesting a potential in future control applications.</description>

      <title>Deadline-Aware Bandwidth Allocation for Semantic Generative Communication with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of Radio Access Network (RAN) in support Artificial Intelligence (AI) application services has grown significantly, underscoring the need for an integrated approach that considers not only network efficiency but also AI performance. In this paper we focus on a semantic generative communication (SGC) framework for image inpainting application. Specifically, the transmitter sends semantic information, i.e., semantic masks and textual descriptions, while the receiver utilizes a conditional diffusion model on a base image, using them as conditioning data to produce the intended image. In this framework, we propose a bandwidth allocation scheme designed to maximize bandwidth efficiency while ensuring generation performance. This approach is based on our finding of a Semantic Deadline--the minimum time that conditioning data is required to be injected to meet a given performance threshold--within the multi-modal SGC framework. Given this observation, the proposed scheme allocates limited bandwidth so that each semantic information can be transmitted within the corresponding semantic deadline. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed bandwidth allocation scheme achieves higher generation performance in terms of PSNR for a given bandwidth compared to traditional schemes that do not account for semantic deadlines.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian Limit of the Output of IIR Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of the output of a stable Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system driven by a non-Gaussian stochastic input. Motivated by longstanding heuristics in the stochastic describing function method, we rigorously characterize when the output process becomes approximately Gaussian, even when the input is not. Using the Wasserstein-1 distance as a quantitative measure of non-Gaussianity, we derive upper bounds on the distance between the appropriately scaled output and a standard normal distribution. These bounds are obtained via Stein's method and depend explicitly on the system's impulse response and the dependence structure of the input process. We show that when the dominant pole of the system approaches the edge of stability and the input satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) independence, (ii) positive correlation with a real and positive dominant pole, or (iii) sufficient correlation decay, the output converges to a standard normal distribution at rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. We also present counterexamples where convergence fails, thereby motivating the stated assumptions. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for the widespread observation that outputs of low-pass LTI systems tend to be approximately Gaussian.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Surrogate Model for Efficient Multi-Task Parameter Learning in Closed-Loop Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12738v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many control problems require repeated tuning and adaptation of controllers across distinct closed-loop tasks, where data efficiency and adaptability are critical. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that is tailored to efficient controller parameter learning in sequential decision-making and control scenarios for distinct tasks. Instead of treating the closed-loop cost as a black-box, our method exploits structural knowledge of the underlying problem, consisting of a dynamical system, a control law, and an associated closed-loop cost function. We construct a hierarchical surrogate model using Gaussian processes that capture the closed-loop state evolution under different parameterizations, while the task-specific weighting and accumulation into the closed-loop cost are computed exactly via known closed-form expressions. This allows knowledge transfer and enhanced data efficiency between different closed-loop tasks. The proposed framework retains sublinear regret guarantees on par with standard black-box BO, while enabling multi-task or transfer learning. Simulation experiments with model predictive control demonstrate substantial benefits in both sample efficiency and adaptability when compared to purely black-box BO approaches.</description>

      <title>PFD or PDF: Rethinking the Probability of Failure in Mitigation Safety Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SIL (Safety Integrity Level) allocation plays a crucial role in defining the design requirements for Safety Functions (SFs) within high-risk industries. SIL is typically determined based on the estimated Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD), which must remain within permissible limits to manage risk effectively. Extensive research has been conducted on determining target PFD and SIL, with a stronger emphasis on preventive SFs than on mitigation SFs. In this paper, we address a rather conceptual issue: we argue that PFD is not an appropriate reliability measure for mitigation SFs to begin with, and we propose an alternative approach that leverages the Probability Density Function (PDF) and the expected degree of failure as key metrics. The principles underlying this approach are explained and supported by detailed mathematical formulations. Furthermore, the practical application of this new methodology is illustrated through case studies.</description>

      <title>Grid Edge Intelligence-Assisted Model Predictive Framework for Black Start of Distribution Systems with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is significantly enhancing the resilience and reliability of distribution systems. However, a substantial portion of behind-the-meter (BTM) DERs is often overlooked during black start (BS) and restoration processes. Existing BS strategies that utilize grid-forming (GFM) battery energy storage systems (BESS) frequently ignore critical frequency security and synchronization constraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a predictive framework for bottom-up BS that leverages the flexibility of BTM DERs through Grid Edge Intelligence (GEI). A predictive model is developed for GEI to estimate multi-period flexibility ranges and track dispatch signals from the utility. A frequency-constrained BS strategy is then introduced, explicitly incorporating constraints on frequency nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), and quasi-steady-state (QSS) frequency. The framework also includes synchronizing switches to enable faster and more secure load restoration. Notably, it requires GEI devices to communicate only their flexibility ranges and the utility to send dispatch signals without exchanging detailed asset information. The proposed framework is validated using a modified IEEE 123-bus test system, and the impact of GEI is demonstrated by comparing results across various GEI penetration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Functional Derivatives in Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probability generating functionals (PGFLs) are efficient and powerful tools for tracking independent objects in clutter. It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity. Key properties of the functional derivative are revealed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Convexity of Neural Networks in Dynamic Operating Envelope Optimization for Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) brings opportunities and challenges to the operation of distribution systems. To ensure network integrity, dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs) are issued by utilities to DERs as their time-varying export/import power limits. Due to the non-convex nature of power flow equations, the optimization of DOEs faces a dilemma of solution accuracy and computation efficiency. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we facilitate DOE optimization by exploiting the convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). A DOE optimization model is first presented, comprehensively considering multiple operational constraints. We propose a constraint embedding method that allows us to replace the non-convex power flow constraints with trained ICNN models and convexify the problem. To further speed up DOE optimization, we propose a linear relaxation of the ICNN-based DOE optimization problem, for which the tightness is theoretically proven. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with numerical case studies. Results show that the proposed ICNN-based method outperforms other benchmark methods in optimizing DOEs in terms of both solution quality and solution time.</description>

      <title>Securing Sideways: Thwarting Lateral Movement by Implementing Active Directory Tiering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of computing equipment and the advances in services over the Internet has allowed corporations, higher education, and many other organizations to pursue the shared computing network environment. A requirement for shared computing environments is a centralized identity system to authenticate and authorize user access. An organization's digital identity plane is a prime target for cyber threat actors. When compromised, identities can be exploited to steal credentials, create unauthorized accounts, and manipulate permissions-enabling attackers to gain control of the network and undermine its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Cybercrime losses reached a record of 16.6 B in the United States in 2024. For organizations using Microsoft software, Active Directory is the on-premises identity system of choice. In this article, we examine the challenge of security compromises in Active Directory (AD) environments and present effective strategies to prevent credential theft and limit lateral movement by threat actors. Our proposed approaches aim to confine the movement of compromised credentials, preventing significant privilege escalation and theft. We argue that through our illustration of real-world scenarios, tiering can halt lateral movement and advanced cyber-attacks, thus reducing ransom escalation. Our work bridges a gap in existing literature by combining technical guidelines with theoretical arguments in support of tiering, positioning it as a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategy even though it cannot function in isolation. As the hardware advances and the cloud sourced services along with AI is advancing with unprecedented speed, we think it is important for security experts and the business to work together and start designing and developing software and frameworks to classify devices automatically and accurately within the tiered structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Transformer-based models has reshaped the landscape of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) systems by enhancing perception, decision-making, and autonomy. This review paper systematically categorizes and evaluates recent developments in Transformer architectures applied to UAVs, including attention mechanisms, CNN-Transformer hybrids, reinforcement learning Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous surveys, this work presents a unified taxonomy of Transformer-based UAV models, highlights emerging applications such as precision agriculture and autonomous navigation, and provides comparative analyses through structured tables and performance benchmarks. The paper also reviews key datasets, simulators, and evaluation metrics used in the field. Furthermore, it identifies existing gaps in the literature, outlines critical challenges in computational efficiency and real-time deployment, and offers future research directions. This comprehensive synthesis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in understanding and advancing Transformer-driven UAV technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Linear Policies in Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the classical discrete-time, Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem where the noise distributions affecting the states and observations are unknown and chosen adversarially from divergence-based ambiguity sets centered around a known nominal distribution. For a finite horizon model with Gaussian nominal noise and a structural assumption on the divergence that is satisfied by many examples -- including 2-Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment-based divergences, entropy-regularized optimal transport, or Fisher (score-matching) divergence -- we prove that a control policy that is affine in the observations is optimal and the adversary's corresponding worst-case optimal distribution is Gaussian.
  When the nominal means are zero (as in the classical LQG model), we show that the adversary should optimally set the distribution's mean to zero and the optimal control policy becomes linear. Moreover, the adversary should optimally ``inflate" the noise by choosing covariance matrices that dominate the nominal covariance in Loewner order. Exploiting these structural properties, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm whose inner step solves standard LQG subproblems via Kalman filtering and dynamic programming and show that the implementation consistently outperforms semidefinite-programming reformulations of the problem. All structural and algorithmic results extend to an infinite-horizon, average-cost formulation, yielding stationary linear policies and a time-invariant Gaussian distribution for the adversary. Lastly, we show that when the divergence is 2-Wasserstein, the entire framework remains valid when the nominal distributions are elliptical rather than Gaussian.</description>

Abstract: In the Day-Ahead (DA) market, suppliers sell and load-serving entities (LSEs) purchase energy commitments, with both sides adjusting for imbalances between contracted and actual deliveries in the Real-Time (RT) market. We develop a supply function equilibrium model to study how virtual trading-speculating on DA-RT price spreads without physical delivery-affects market efficiency. Without virtual trading, LSEs underbid relative to actual demand in the DA market, pushing DA prices below expected RT prices. Virtual trading narrows, and in the limit of large number traders can eliminates, this price gap. However, it does not induce quantity alignment: DA-cleared demand remains below true expected demand, as price alignment makes the LSE indifferent between markets and prompts it to reduce DA bids to avoid over-purchasing. Renewable energy suppliers cannot offset these strategic distortions. We provide empirical support to our main model implications using data from the California and New York Independent System Operators.</description>

      <title>Active Fault Identification and Robust Control for Unknown Bounded Faults via Volume-Based Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for active fault diagnosis and parameter estimation in linear systems operating in closed-loop, subject to unknown but bounded faults. The approach integrates set-membership identification with a cost function designed to accelerate fault identification. Informative excitation is achieved by minimizing the size of the parameter uncertainty set, which is approximated using ellipsoidal outer bounds. Combining this formulation with a scheduling parameter enables a transition back to nominal control as confidence in the model estimates increases. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed approach does not rely on predefined fault models. Instead, it only requires known bounds on parameter deviations and additive disturbances. Robust constraint satisfaction is guaranteed through a tube-based model predictive control scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the method achieves faster fault detection and identification compared to passive strategies and adaptive ones based on persistent excitation constraints.</description>

      <title>Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</description>

      <title>Semi-Infinite Programming for Collision-Avoidance in Optimal and Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for collision avoidance in optimal and model predictive control, in which the environment is represented by a large number of points and the robot as a union of padded polygons. The conditions that none of the points shall collide with the robot can be written in terms of an infinite number of constraints per obstacle point. We show that the resulting semi-infinite programming (SIP) optimal control problem (OCP) can be efficiently tackled through a combination of two methods: local reduction and an external active-set method. Specifically, this involves iteratively identifying the closest point obstacles, determining the lower-level distance minimizer among all feasible robot shape parameters, and solving the upper-level finitely-constrained subproblems.
  In addition, this paper addresses robust collision avoidance in the presence of ellipsoidal state uncertainties. Enforcing constraint satisfaction over all possible uncertainty realizations extends the dimension of constraint infiniteness. The infinitely many constraints arising from translational uncertainty are handled by local reduction together with the robot shape parameterization, while rotational uncertainty is addressed via a backoff reformulation.
  A controller implemented based on the proposed method is demonstrated on a real-world robot running at 20Hz, enabling fast and collision-free navigation in tight spaces. An application to 3D collision avoidance is also demonstrated in simulation.</description>

      <title>PUB: A Plasma-Propelled Ultra-Quiet Blimp with Two-DOF Vector Thrusting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the design and control of a Plasma-propelled Ultra-silence Blimp (PUB), a novel aerial robot employing plasma vector propulsion for ultra-quiet flight without mechanical propellers. The system utilizes a helium-lift platform for extended endurance and a four-layer ring asymmetric capacitor to generate ionic wind thrust. The modular propulsion units allow flexible configuration to meet mission-specific requirements, while a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head enables thrust vector control. A closed-loop slip control scheme is implemented for stable maneuvering. Flight experiments demonstrate full-envelope capability, including take-off, climb, hover, descent, and smooth landing, confirming the feasibility of plasma vector propulsion, the effectiveness of DOF vector control, and the stability of the control system. Owing to its low acoustic signature, structural simplicity, and high maneuverability, PUB is well suited for noise-sensitive, enclosed, and near-space applications.</description>

      <title>Advanced DOA Regulation with a Whale-Optimized Fractional Order Fuzzy PID Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a Fractional Order Fuzzy PID (FOFPID) controller that uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to manage the Bispectral Index (BIS), keeping it within the ideal range of forty to sixty. The FOFPID controller combines fuzzy logic for adapting to changes and fractional order dynamics for fine tuning. This allows it to adjust its control gains to handle a person's unique physiology. The WOA helps fine tune the controller's parameters, including the fractional orders and the fuzzy membership functions, which boosts its performance. Tested on models of eight different patient profiles, the FOFPID controller performed better than a standard Fractional Order PID (FOPID) controller. It achieved faster settling times, at two and a half minutes versus three point two minutes, and had a lower steady state error, at zero point five versus one point two. These outcomes show the FOFPID's excellent strength and accuracy. It offers a scalable, artificial intelligence driven solution for automated anesthesia delivery that could enhance clinical practice and improve patient results.</description>

      <title>Graphon Mean-Field Logit Dynamic: Derivation, Computation, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graphon mean-field logit dynamic, a stationary mean-field game based on logit interactions. This dynamic emerges from a stochastic control problem involving a continuum of nonexchangeable and interacting agents and reduces to solving a continuum of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations connected through a graphon that models the connections among agents. Using a fixed-point argument, we prove that this HJB system admits a unique solution in the space of bounded functions when the discount rate is high (i.e., agents are myopic). Under certain assumptions, we also establish regularity properties of the system, such as equi-continuity. We propose a finite difference scheme for computing the HJB system and prove the uniqueness and existence of its numerical solutions. The mean-field logit dynamic is applied to a case study on inland fisheries resource management in the upper Tedori River of Japan. A series of computational cases are then conducted to investigate the dependence of the dynamic on both the discount rate and graphon.</description>

      <title>BUILDA: A Thermal Building Data Generation Framework for Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) can improve data-driven modeling of building thermal dynamics. Therefore, many new TL research areas emerge in the field, such as selecting the right source model for TL. However, these research directions require massive amounts of thermal building data which is lacking presently. Neither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for producing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for pretraining and fine-tuning TL models.</description>

      <title>MCTR: Midpoint Corrected Triangulation for Autonomous Racing via Digital Twin Simulation in CARLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In autonomous racing, reactive controllers eliminate the computational burden of the full See-Think-Act autonomy stack by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions. This bypasses the need for explicit localization and trajectory planning. A widely adopted baseline in this category is the Follow-The-Gap method, which performs trajectory planning using LiDAR data. Building on FTG, the Delaunay Triangulation-based Racing algorithm introduces further enhancements. However, DTR's use of circumcircles for trajectory generation often results in insufficiently smooth paths, ultimately degrading performance. Additionally, the commonly used F1TENTH-simulator for autonomous racing competitions lacks support for 3D LiDAR perception, limiting its effectiveness in realistic testing. To address these challenges, this work proposes the MCTR algorithm. MCTR improves trajectory smoothness through the use of Curvature Corrected Moving Average and implements a digital twin system within the CARLA simulator to validate the algorithm's robustness under 3D LiDAR perception. The proposed algorithm has been thoroughly validated through both simulation and real-world vehicle experiments.</description>

      <title>[Social] Allostasis: Or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers, analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems</description>

      <title>Sufficient A Priori Conditions for the Linear Relaxation of the Energy Storage Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When modeling energy storage systems, an essential question is how to account for the physical infeasibility of simultaneous charge and discharge. The use of complementarity constraints or of binary variables is common, but these formulations do not scale well. Alternatively, assumptions such as perfect efficiencies or positive prices are often used to justify the choice of a linear model. In this paper, we establish new a priori conditions that guarantee the existence of an optimal solution without simultaneous charge and discharge when solving the linear relaxation of the storage scheduling problem. They are based on the characteristics of the storage system, in particular, the duration of charge. They can be valid for negative prices and with inefficiencies, thereby enlarging the set of conditions for which the complementarity constraints can be relaxed. We prove mathematically the validity of these conditions and illustrate them with practical examples. We also introduce a refined mixed-integer linear equivalent, in which the number of binary variables can be drastically reduced.</description>

      <title>Manipulate-to-Navigate: Reinforcement Learning with Visual Affordances and Manipulability Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile manipulation in dynamic environments is challenging due to movable obstacles blocking the robot's path. Traditional methods, which treat navigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such 'manipulate-to-navigate' scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before navigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required to clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the manipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent navigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on high manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting high-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful actions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to learn manipulation strategies more effectively. We present two new manipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good hand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively forward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires the robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of these tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward. Results show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and traverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a real Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task.</description>

      <title>Self-Tuning PID Control via a Hybrid Actor-Critic-Based Neural Structure for Quadcopter Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proportional-Integrator-Derivative (PID) controller is used in a wide range of industrial and experimental processes. There are a couple of offline methods for tuning PID gains. However, due to the uncertainty of model parameters and external disturbances, real systems such as Quadrotors need more robust and reliable PID controllers. In this research, a self-tuning PID controller using a Reinforcement-Learning-based Neural Network for attitude and altitude control of a Quadrotor has been investigated. An Incremental PID, which contains static and dynamic gains, has been considered and only the variable gains have been tuned. To tune dynamic gains, a model-free actor-critic-based hybrid neural structure was used that was able to properly tune PID gains, and also has done the best as an identifier. In both tunning and identification tasks, a Neural Network with two hidden layers and sigmoid activation functions has been learned using Adaptive Momentum (ADAM) optimizer and Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm. This method is online, able to tackle disturbance, and fast in training. In addition to robustness to mass uncertainty and wind gust disturbance, results showed that the proposed method had a better performance when compared to a PID controller with constant gains.</description>

      <title>Learning Zero-Sum Linear Quadratic Games with Improved Sample Complexity and Last-Iterate Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-sum Linear Quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i)~as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii)~as a benchmark setting for multi-agent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. showed that an~$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithms with poly$(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested Zeroth-Order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main results are two-fold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish a~$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the Implicit Regularization (IR) property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we first show that the problem of parameter identification is often ill-conditioned and lacks the persistence of excitation required for the convergence of online learning schemes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the notion of optimal and greedy excitation sets which contain data points with sufficient richness to aid in the identification task. We then present the greedy excitation set-based recursive least squares algorithm to alleviate the problem of the lack of persistent excitation, and prove that the iterates generated by the proposed algorithm minimize an auxiliary weighted least squares cost function. When data points are generated from time-varying parameters, online estimators tend to underfit the true parameter trajectory, and their predictability deteriorates. To tackle this problem, we propose a memory resetting scheme leveraging change point detection techniques. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms via several numerical case studies to learn the (time-varying) parameters of networked epidemic dynamics, and compare it with results obtained using conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification and Control with Conformal Prediction</title>

Abstract: We present recent advances in formal verification and control for autonomous systems with practical safety guarantees enabled by conformal prediction (CP), a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. This survey is particularly motivated by learning-enabled autonomous systems (LEASs), where the complexity of learning-enabled components (LECs) poses a major bottleneck for applying traditional model-based verification and control techniques. To address this challenge, we advocate for CP as a lightweight alternative and demonstrate its use in formal verification, systems and control, and robotics. CP is appealing due to its simplicity (easy to understand, implement, and adapt), generality (requires no assumptions on learned models and underlying data distributions), and efficiency (real-time capable and accurate). This survey provides an accessible introduction to CP for non-experts interested in applying CP to autonomy problems. We particularly show how CP can be used for formal verification of LECs and the design of safe control as well as offline and online verification algorithms for LEASs. We present these techniques within a unifying framework that addresses the complexity of LEASs. Our exposition spans simple specifications, such as robot navigation tasks, to complex mission requirements expressed in temporal logic. Throughout the survey, we contrast CP with other statistical techniques, including scenario optimization and PAC-Bayes theory, highlighting advantages and limitations for verification and control. Finally, we outline open problems and promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Open-/Closed-loop Active Learning for Data-driven Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important question in data-driven control is how to obtain an informative dataset. In this work, we consider the problem of effective data acquisition of an unknown linear system with bounded disturbance for both open-loop and closed-loop stages. The learning objective is to minimize the volume of the set of admissible systems. First, a performance measure based on historical data and the input sequence is introduced to characterize the upper bound of the volume of the set of admissible systems. On the basis of this performance measure, an open-loop active learning strategy is proposed to minimize the volume by actively designing inputs during the open-loop stage. For the closed-loop stage, a closed-loop active learning strategy is designed to select and learn from informative closed-loop data. The efficiency of the proposed closed-loop active learning strategy is proved by showing that the unselected data cannot benefit the learning performance. Furthermore, an adaptive predictive controller is designed in accordance with the proposed data acquisition approach. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the controller are proved by analyzing the effect of the closed-loop active learning strategy. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed data acquisition strategy.</description>

      <title>A Communication Consistent Approach to Signal Temporal Logic Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.</description>

      <title>Joint Power and Spectrum Orchestration for D2D Semantic Communication Underlying Energy-Efficient Cellular Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantic-value/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optical Wireless Ether: Enabling Controlled Dynamic Signal Propagation in OWC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) leverages the terahertz-scale optical spectrum to enable ultra-fast data transfer, offering a compelling alternative to often-congested radio frequency systems. However, the highly directional nature of optical signals and their susceptibility to obstruction inherently limit coverage and reliability, particularly in dynamic indoor environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose optical wireless ether (OWE), a novel framework that transforms indoor spaces into a dynamically controllable optical propagation medium. OWE employs a distributed network of ether amplifiers (EAs), which act as optical amplifiers with programmable gain values to extend coverage through diffuse reflections while compensating for signal attenuation. A key challenge in OWE is preventing amplifier saturation from feedback loops. We rigorously derive stability constraints to guarantee system robustness. Beyond coverage extension, OWE dynamically adjusts EA gains in response to user locations and channel conditions, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, balancing resource allocation, and suppressing interference. As the first framework to harness diffuse reflection for controllable optical propagation, we validate OWE's effectiveness through analytical modeling, simulations, and prototyping. Our work lays the foundation for robust, high-speed indoor OWC networks.</description>

      <title>Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of a smooth tracking control for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems under stringent state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints is challenging. In contrast to existing methods that utilize prior knowledge of EL model parameters and uncertainty bounds, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy to ensure local prescribed time convergence of tracking error under state and input constraints. The proposed approach uses smooth time-based generator functions embedded in the filtered tracking error, which is combined with a saturation function that limits control action and confines states within the prescribed limits by enforcing the time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions are derived pertaining to the minimum control authority, the maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions, illuminating the narrow operating domain of EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using experimental and comparison studies.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reliability of Electric Vehicle Charging Ecosystem using the Principle of Maximum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating the reliability of an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems when facing risks such as overheating, unpredictable, weather, and cyberattacks. Traditional methods for predicting failures often rely on past data or limiting assumptions, making them ineffective for new or less common threats that results in failure. To solve this issue, we utilize the Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME), a statistical tool that estimates risks even with limited information. PME works by balancing known constraints to create an unbiased predictions without guessing missing details. Using the EV charging ecosystem as a case study, we show how PME models stress factors responsible for failure. Our findings reveal a critical insight: even minor, localized stress events can trigger disproportionately large drops in overall system reliability, similar to a domino effect. The our PME model demonstrates how high-impact components, such as the power grid, are more likely to fail as stress accumulates, creating network-wide tipping points. Beyond EVs, this approach applies to any complex system with incomplete data, such as smart grids, healthcare devices, or logistics networks. By mathematically establishing an inverse relationship between uncertainty (entropy) and reliability, our work quantifies how greater system unpredictability directly degrades robustness. This offers a universal tool to improve decision-making under unpredictable conditions. This work bridges advanced mathematics with real-world engineering, providing actionable insights for policymakers and industries to build safer, more efficient systems in our increasingly connected world.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Autonomous Driving Policies using a Neuro-Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of driving environments and the presence of diverse road users pose significant challenges for decision-making in autonomous driving. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a popular approach to tackle this problem. However, the application of existing DRL solutions is mainly confined to simulated environments due to safety concerns, impeding their deployment in real-world. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic model-free DRL approach, called DRL with Symbolic Logic (DRLSL) that combines the strengths of DRL (learning from experience) and symbolic first-order logic (knowledge-driven reasoning) to enable safe learning in real-time interactions of autonomous driving within real environments. This innovative approach provides a means to learn autonomous driving policies by actively engaging with the physical environment while ensuring safety. We have implemented the DRLSL framework in a highway driving scenario using the HighD dataset and demonstrated that our method successfully avoids unsafe actions during both the training and testing phases. Furthermore, our results indicate that DRLSL achieves faster convergence during training and exhibits better generalizability to new highway driving scenarios compared to traditional DRL methods.</description>

      <title>STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</description>

Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5 meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

      <title>Towards Infant Sleep-Optimized Driving: Synergizing Wearable and Vehicle Sensing in Intelligent Cruise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation experiments conducted in the CARLA environment indicate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.</description>

      <title>Two-Instrument Screening under Soft Budget Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study soft budget constraints in multi-tier public finance when an upper-tier government uses two instruments: an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post rescue. Under convex rescue costs and standard primitives, the three-stage leader-follower problem collapses to one dimensional screening with a single allocation index: the cap on realized rescue. A hazard-based characterization delivers a unified rule that nests (i) no rescue, (ii) a threshold-cap with commitment, and (iii) a threshold--linear--cap without commitment. The knife-edge for eliminating bailouts compares the marginal cost at the origin to the supremum of a virtual weight, and the comparative statics show how greater curvature tightens caps while discretion shifts transfers toward front loading by lowering the effective grant weight. The framework provides a portable benchmark for mechanism design and yields testable implications for policy and empirical work on intergovernmental finance.</description>
