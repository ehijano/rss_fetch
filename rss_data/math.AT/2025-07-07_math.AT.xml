      <title>Twisted Bredon-Illman Cohomology is a Morita Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the twisted Bredon-Illman cohomology defined by Mukherjee-Mukherjee applied to compact Lie group action groupoids is Morita-invariant. This cohomology uses coefficient systems twisted over the discrete tom Dieck equivariant fundamental groupoid. To show Morita invariance, we use bibundles to transfer coefficient systems from one groupoid to another Morita equivalent one. This generalises results of Pronk-Scull on ordinary Bredon-Illman cohomology by removing both the finite isotropy condition and restrictions on the coefficient systems.</description>

      <title>Lie algebra homology with coefficients tensor products of the adjoint representation in relative polynomial degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles.
  There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1.
  This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</description>

      <title>Pre-Lie algebras up to homotopy with divided powers and homotopy of operadic mapping spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this memoir is to study pre-Lie algebras up to homotopy with divided powers, and to use this algebraic structure for the study of mapping spaces in the category of operads. We define a new notion of algebra called $\Gamma\Lambda\mathcal{PL}_\infty$-algebra which characterizes the notion of $\Gamma(\mathcal{P}re\mathcal{L}ie_\infty,-)$-algebra. We also define a notion of a Maurer-Cartan element in complete $\Gamma\Lambda\mathcal{PL}_\infty$-algebras which generalizes the classical definition in Lie algebras. We prove that for every complete brace algebra $A$, and for every $n\geq 0$, the tensor product $A\otimes\Sigma N^*(\Delta^n)$ is endowed with the structure of a complete $\Gamma\Lambda\mathcal{PL}_\infty$-algebra, and define the simplicial Maurer-Cartan set $\mathcal{MC}_\bullet(A)$ associated to $A$ as the Maurer-Cartan set of $ A\otimes\Sigma N^*(\Delta^\bullet)$. We compute the homotopy groups of this simplicial set, and prove that the functor $\mathcal{MC}_\bullet(-)$ satisfies a homotopy invariance result, which extends the Goldman-Millson theorem in dimension $0$. As an application, we give a description of mapping spaces in the category of non-symmetric operads in terms of this simplicial Maurer-Cartan set. We etablish a generalization of the latter result for symmetric operads.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem refers to the question of the existence of a Nash equilibrium in an abstract economy. This model is due to Kenneth J. Arrow and Gerard Debreu in their pioneering work from 1954. An abstract economy is an extension of John Nash's original concept of a non-cooperative game from the 1950's. Here players selfishly seek to maximize their profits, which may depend on the others' choices. The novelty of an abstract economy is that the players may now mutually constrain each-other in their decision-making. A Nash equilibrium is reached when no player alone can increase his profit by a unilateral change of strategy. Abstract economies have found widespread applications from welfare economy, economic analysis and policy-making to constrained optimization, partial differential equations and optimal allocation.
  We generalize Leigh Tesfatsion's Nash equilibrium existence result to abstract economies without resorting to commonly employed convexity assumptions, thereby also re-proving all known Nash equilibrium existence results as special cases. A key element of our proof is the translation of the Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem into the question of the existence of a coincidence of two particularly defined maps, and the application of a coincidence result from algebraic topology due to Samuel Eilenberg and Deane Montgomery in 1946.</description>

      <title>Semiadditive Alternating Powers and Twisted Power Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of representations of symmetric groups in higher semiadditive categories. For these representations in $\mathrm{Mod}^{\wedge}_{E_n}$, the transchromatic character of Hopkins--Kuhn--Ravenel and Stapleton is recovered as a sequence of monoidal characters on suitable categorifications, giving an explicit algorithm for its computation, and relating it to the iterated monoidal character in $(\infty,n)$-categories. These representations also give rise to notions of alternating powers and power operations in semiadditive categories, extending the classical alternating powers and $\lambda$-operations in $\mathrm{K}$-theory. We provide explicit computations in both the chromatic and higher categorical settings at low heights.</description>

      <title>Smooth manifolds in $G_{n,2}$ and $\mathbb{C} P^{N}$ defined by symplectic reductions of $T^n$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pl\"ucker coordinates define the $T^n$-equivariant embedding $p : G_{n,2}\to \mathbb{C} P^{N}$ of a complex Grassmann manifold $G_{n,2}$ into the complex projective space $\mathbb{C} P^{N}$, $N=\binom{n}{2}-1$ for the canonical $T^n$-action on $G_{n,2}$ and the $T^n$-action on $\mathbb{C} P^{N}$ given by the second symmetric power representation $T^n\to T^{N}$ and the standard $T^{N}$-action. Let $\mu : G_{n,2}\to \Delta_{n,2}\subset \mathbb{R} ^{n}$ and $\tilde{\mu}: \mathbb{C} P^{N}\to \Delta _{n,2}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be the moment maps for the $T^n$-actions on $G_{n,2}$ and $\mathbb{C} P^{N}$ respectively, such that $\tilde{\mu} \circ p=\mu$. The preimages $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})$ and $\tilde{\mu} ^{-1}({\bf y})$ are smooth submanifolds in $G_{n, 2}$ and $\mathbb{C} P^{N}$, for any regular values ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in \Delta _{n,2}$ for these maps, respectively. The orbit spaces $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})/T^n$ and $\tilde{\mu}^{-1}({\bf y})/T^n$ are symplectic manifolds, which are known as symplectic reduction.
  The regular values for $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$ coincide for $n=4$ and we prove that $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})$ and $\tilde{\mu}^{-1}({\bf x}) $ do not depend on a regular value ${\bf x}\in \Delta_{4,2}$. We provide their explicit topological description, that is we prove $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})\cong S^3\times T^2$ and $\tilde{\mu} ^{-1}({\bf x})\cong S^5\times T^2$.
  In addition, we discuss, from the point of view of symplectic reduction, our results on description of the orbit space $G_{n,2}/T^n$, which are related to the Deligne-Mumford and Losev-Manin compactifications.</description>

      <title>Molecular Machine Learning Using Euler Characteristic Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor. Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features, offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance}, outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and code used in this work.</description>

      <title>Generic infinite generation, fixed-point-poor representations and compact-element abundance in disconnected Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semidirect product $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{L}\rtimes \mathbb{K}$ attached to a compact-group action on a connected, simply-connected solvable Lie group has a dense set of compact elements precisely when the $s\in \mathbb{K}$ operating on $\mathbb{L}$ fixed-point-freely constitute a dense set. This (along with a number of alternative equivalent characterizations) extends the Wu's analogous result for connected Lie $\mathbb{K}$, and also provides ample supplies of examples of almost-connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ which do not have dense sets of compact elements, even though their identity components $\mathbb{G}_0$ do. This corrects prior literature on the subject, claiming the property equivalent for $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{G}_0$.
  In a related discussion we characterize those connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ with large sets of $d$-tuples generating dense subgroups $\Gamma\le \mathbb{G}$ for which the derived subgroup $\Gamma^{(1)}$ fails to be finitely-generated: $\mathbb{G}$ must either be non-trivial topologically perfect or have non-nilpotent maximal solvable quotient.</description>

      <title>The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class $\mathcal{M}$ of monomorphisms, in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of $\mathcal{M}$.</description>

      <title>Differentiable structures on a union of two open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper the authors classified differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{L}$ called the line with two origins which is obtained by gluing two copies of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}\setminus 0$.
  Here we give a classification of differentiable structures on another non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{Y}$ (called letter "$Y$") obtained by gluing two copies of $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity map of positive reals. It turns out that, in contrast to the real line, for every $r=1,\ldots,\infty$, both manifolds $\mathbb{L}$ and $\mathbb{Y}$ admit uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures.
  We also observe that the proofs of these classifications are very similar. This allows to formalize the arguments and extend them to a certain general statement about arrows in arbitrary categories.</description>

Abstract: We study the homotopy type of the space of the unitary group $\U_1(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$ of the uniform Roe algebra $C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|)$ of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We show that the stabilizing map $\U_1(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))\to\U_\infty(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$ is a homotopy equivalence. Moreover, when $n=1,2$, we determine the homotopy type of $\U_1(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$, which is the product of the unitary group $\U_1(C^\ast(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$ (having the homotopy type of $\U_\infty(\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathbb{Z}\times B\U_\infty(\mathbb{C})$ depending on the parity of $n$) of the Roe algebra $C^\ast(|\mathbb{Z}^n|)$ and rational Eilenberg--MacLane spaces.</description>

      <title>On Covering Euclidean Space with Q-arrangements of Cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a covering problem of Euclidean space by a particular arrangement of cones that are not necessarily full and are allowed to overlap. The problem provides an equivalent geometric reformulation of the solvability of the linear complementarity problem defining the class of Q-matrices. Assuming feasibility, we rely on standard tools from convex geometry to study maximal connected uncovered regions, we term \emph{holes}. We then use our approach to fully characterize the problem for dimension $3$, regardless of degeneracy. We further provide, for $n \leq 3$, an algebraic characterization for the class of Q-matrices. That is, we show that, $M$ is a Q-matrix if and only if its entries belong to an explicit semi-algebraic set (in dimension $9$) where all the involved polynomials are subdeterminants of $M$. We showcase the usefulness of such a characterization by generating $3$-by-$3$ Q-matrices with specific interesting properties on the involved cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on work of Hill, Hoyer and Mazur we propose an equivariant version of a Loday construction for $G$-Tambara functors where $G$ is an arbitrary finite group. For any finite simplicial $G$-set and any $G$-Tambara functor, our Loday construction is a simplicial $G$-Tambara functor. We study its properties and examples. For a circle with rotation action by a finite cyclic group our construction agrees with the twisted cyclic nerve of Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, and Lawson. We also show how the Loday construction for genuine commutative $G$-ring spectra relates to our algebraic one via the $\underline{\pi}_0$-functor. We describe Real topological Hochschild homology as such a Loday construction.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concepts of branched coarse coverings and transfers between coarse homology theories along them. We show that various versions of coarse $K$-homology theories admit the additional structure of transfers. We show versions of Atiyah's $L^{2}$-index theorem in coarse homotopy theory and apply them to give a new argument for the corresponding step in Higson's counterexample to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <title>Unstable $1$-semiadditivity as classifying Goodwillie towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stable $\infty$-category is $1$-semiadditive if all norms for finite group actions are equivalences. In the presence of $1$-semiadditivity, Goodwillie calculus simplifies drastically. We introduce two unstable analogs of $1$-semiadditivity for an $\infty$-category $C$ and study their relation to the Goodwillie calculus of functors $C \rightarrow \s(C)$. We demonstrate these qualities are complete obstructions to the problem of endowing $\partial_\ast F$ with either a right module or a divided power right module structure which completely classifies the Goodwillie tower of $F$. We find applications to algebraic localizations of spaces, the Morita theory of operads, and bar-cobar duality of algebras. Along the way, we address several milestones in these areas including: Lie structures in the Goodwillie calculus of spaces, spectral Lie algebra models of $v_h$-periodic homotopy theory, and the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality of $E_d$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances, Borsuk-Ulam theorems, and Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore emerging relationships between the Gromov--Hausdorff distance, Borsuk--Ulam theorems, and Vietoris--Rips simplicial complexes. The Gromov--Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces $X$ and~$Y$ can be lower bounded by the distortion of (possibly discontinuous) functions between them. The more these functions must distort the metrics, the larger the Gromov--Hausdorff distance must be. Topology has few tools to obstruct the existence of discontinuous functions. However, an arbitrary function $f\colon X\to Y$ induces a continuous map between their Vietoris--Rips simplicial complexes, where the allowable choices of scale parameters depend on how much the function $f$ distorts distances. We can then use equivariant topology to obstruct the existence of certain continuous maps between Vietoris--Rips complexes. With these ideas we bound how discontinuous an odd map between spheres $S^k\to S^n$ with $k&gt;n$ must be, generalizing a result by Dubins and Schwarz (1981), which is the case $k=n+1$. As an application, we recover or improve upon all of the lower bounds from Lim, M{\'e}moli, and Smith (2022) on the Gromov--Hausdorff distances between spheres of different dimensions. We also provide new upper bounds on the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between spheres of adjacent dimensions.</description>

      <title>The motive of a variety with cellular resolution of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complex variety $X$ admits a cellular resolution of singularities if there exists a resolution of singularities $\widetilde X\to X$ such that its exceptional locus as well as $\widetilde X$ and the singular locus of $X$ admit a cellular decomposition. We give a concrete description of the motive with compact support of $X$ in terms of its Borel-Moore homology, under some mild conditions. We give many examples, including rational projective curves and toric varieties of dimension two and three.</description>

      <title>On Modular Invariants of Truncated Polynomial Rings in low ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify the conjectures due to Lewis, Reiner and Stanton about the Hilbert series of the invariant ring of the truncated polynomial ring for all parabolic subgroups up to rank $3$. This is done by constructing an explicit set of generators for each invariant ring in question. We also propose a conjecture concerning the action of the Steenrod algebra and the Dickson algebra on a certain naturally occurring filtration of the invariant ring under the general linear group.</description>

      <title>Floer homotopy theory for monotone Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We circumvent one of the roadblocks in associating Floer homotopy types to monotone Lagrangians, namely the curvature phenomena occurring in high dimensions. Given $N \ge 3$ and $R$ a connective $\mathbb E_1$-ring spectrum, there is a notion of an $N$-truncated, $R$-oriented flow category, to which we associate a module prospectrum over the Postnikov truncation $\tau_{\le N - 3}R$. This endows ordinary Floer cohomology with an action of the Steenrod algebra over $\tau_{\le N-3}R$, and also induces certain generalized cohomology theories. We give sufficient conditions for a closed embedded monotone Lagrangian to admit such well-defined invariants for $N = N_\mu$ the minimal Maslov number, and $R = MU$ complex bordism. Finally, we formulate Oh-Pozniak type spectral sequences for these invariants, and show that in the case of $\mathbb{RP}^n \subset \mathbb{CP}^n$ they provide further restrictions on the topology of clean intersections with a Hamiltonian isotopy, not detected by ordinary Floer (co)homology.</description>
