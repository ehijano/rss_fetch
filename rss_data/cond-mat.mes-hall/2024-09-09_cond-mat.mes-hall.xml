      <title>Theory of Field-Angle-Resolved Magnetoacoustic Resonance in Spin-Triplet Systems for Application to Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent studies of acoustically driven electron spin resonance applied to diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, we investigate the interaction of an electronic spin-triplet state with periodically time-dependent oscillating strain fields. On the basis of a lowest-lying two-level system, we show the importance of two-phonon transition probabilities controlled by rotating an applied magnetic field using the Floquet theory. In particular, we demonstrate how to evaluate coupling-strength parameters in the spin--strain interaction for the $C_{3v}$ point group considering the NV spin states. The level splitting of spin states can be adjusted by changing the field directions relative to the NV axis to obtain lower phonon resonance frequencies suitable for practical applications. Focusing on a field-rotation angle for the vanishment of a longitudinal phonon-mediated transition, we show that the magnetoacoustic resonance presented here provides useful information as a new probe of unquantified spin--strain couplings possessed by NV defects.</description>

      <title>CMOS compatibility of semiconductor spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several domains of society will be disrupted once millions of high-quality qubits can be brought together to perform fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). All quantum computing hardware available today is many orders of magnitude removed from the requirements for FTQC. The intimidating challenges associated with integrating such complex systems have already been addressed by the semiconductor industry -hence many qubit makers have retrofitted their technology to be CMOS-compatible. This compatibility, however, can have varying degrees ranging from the mere ability to fabricate qubits using a silicon wafer as a substrate, all the way to the co-integration of qubits with high-yield, low-power advanced electronics to control these qubits. Extrapolating the evolution of quantum processors to future systems, semiconductor spin qubits have unique advantages in this respect, making them one of the most serious contenders for large-scale FTQC. In this review, we focus on the overlap between state-of-the-art semiconductor spin qubit systems and CMOS industry Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) principles. We identify the main differences in spin qubit operation, material, and system requirements compared to well-established CMOS industry practices. As key players in the field are looking to collaborate with CMOS industry partners, this review serves to accelerate R&amp;D towards the industrial scale production of FTQC processors.</description>

      <title>Long wavelength interdomain phonons and instability of dislocations in small-angle twisted bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.</description>

      <title>Hidden chiral symmetry for kagome lattice and its analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry plays an essential role in condensed matter physics. In tight-binding models, it is often attributed to bipartite lattice structures, and its typical consequence is the ``particle-hole symmetric" band structures, that is, the positive and negative eigenenergies appear in a pairwise manner. In this work, we address the chiral symmetry for non-bipartite lattice models with flat bands. Our argument relies on what we call the molecular-orbital representation, by which we can guarantee the existence of the flat band. We show that the chiral symmetry is preserved for the non-flat bands when the molecular orbitals are normalized and divided into two sets within which they are non-overlapping. The chiral operator is constructed by the same molecular orbitals as the Hamiltonian. This results in the characteristic relation between the chiral operator and the Hamiltonian, which we call the Pythagoras relation. We present the examples of such models, i.e., the kagome lattice and its one-dimensional analog, and address the characteristics originating from the chiral symmetry, such as the emergence of the topological edge modes. We also show an example where the numbers of molecular orbitals in each set are different from each other, resulting in multiple flat bands with different energies.</description>

      <title>Planar scanning probe microscopy enables vector magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04252v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar scanning probe microscopy is a recently emerging alternative approach to tip-based scanning probe imaging. It can scan an extended planar sensor, such as a polished bulk diamond doped with magnetic-field-sensitive nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, in nanometer-scale proximity of a planar sample. So far, this technique has been limited to optical near-field microscopy, and has required nanofabrication of the sample of interest. Here we extend this technique to magnetometry using NV centers, and present a modification that removes the need for sample-side nanofabrication. We harness this new ability to perform a hitherto infeasible measurement - direct imaging of the three-dimensional vector magnetic field of magnetic vortices in a thin film magnetic heterostructure, based on repeated scanning with NV centers with different orientations within the same scanning probe. Our result opens the door to quantum sensing using multiple qubits within the same scanning probe, a prerequisite for the use of entanglement-enhanced and massively parallel schemes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Bulk and surface electron scattering in disordered Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ probed by quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the electronic properties of the topological insulator Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at low temperature. We obtained high-resolution quasiparticle interference data of the topological surface Dirac electrons at different energies. Spin-selective joint density of states calculations were performed for surface and bulk electronic states to interpret the observed quasiparticle interference data. The topological properties of our crystals are demonstrated by the absence of backscattering along with the linear energy dispersion of the dominant scattering vector. In addition, we detect non-dispersive scattering modes which we associate with bulk-surface scattering and, thus, allow an approximate identification of the bulk energy gap range based on our quasiparticle interference data. Measurements of differential conductance maps in magnetic fields up to 15 T have been carried out, but no strong modifications could be observed.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.</description>

      <title>Modeling of decoherence and fidelity enhancement during transport of entangled qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled qubits transported through space is a key element in many prospective quantum information systems, from long-distance quantum communication to large modular quantum processors. The moving qubits are decohered by time- and space-dependent noises with finite extent of correlations. Since the qubit paths are interrelated, the phase fluctuations experienced by the qubits exhibit peculiar correlations, which are difficult to analyze with the conventional theory of random processes. We propose an approach to this problem based on the concept of trajectories on random sheets. We establish its efficacy with a specific example of the electron spins shuttled in semiconductor structures, and derive explicit solutions, revealing the role of unusual noise correlations. We also demonstrate how the analysis of noise correlations can enhance the shuttling fidelity, by studying transport of two entangled spins encoding a logical qubit. The proposed approach enabled us to specify the favorable conditions for this encoding, and find a particularly beneficial shuttling regime. We also describe application of this approach to other shuttling scenarios, and explain its utility for analysis of other types of systems, such as atomic qubits and photons in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Optical response of alternating twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study via microscopic considerations and symmetry principles the optical response of the alternating twisted trilayer graphene. The layer-resolved optical conductivities are expressed in terms of contributions from effective twisted bilayer and single-layer systems along with their coupling. We show the emergence of constitutive laws for: (i) an in-plane magnetic response proportional to the above coupling; and (ii) an effective twisted-bilayer electro-magnetic response that involves a chirality parameter. We estimate the in-plane magnetic response to be negligible, but finite for twists close to the magic angle near charge neutrality. Our approach makes use of a unitary transformation for the trilayer Hamiltonian, and the Kubo formulation of linear response theory. We discuss other implications of our analytical results such as features of bulk plasmonic modes.</description>

      <title>Factors influencing quantum evaporation of helium from polar semiconductors from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there is much indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM), to date it has evaded detection. Current efforts focus on DM masses over $\sim$GeV -- to push the sensitivity of DM searches to lower masses, new DM targets and detection schemes are needed. In this work, we focus on the latter - a novel detection scheme recently proposed to detect ~10-100 meV phonons in polar target materials. Previous work showed that well-motivated models of DM can interact with polar semiconductors to produce an athermal population of phonons. This new sensing scheme proposes that these phonons then facilitate quantum evaporation of $^3$He from a van der Waals film deposited on the target material. However, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still unclear, with several uncertainties related to the precise rate of evaporation and how it can be controlled. In this work, we use \textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compare the adsorption energies of helium atoms on a polar target material, sodium iodide (NaI), to understand the underlying evaporation physics. We explore the role of surface termination, monolayer coverage and elemental species on the rate of He evaporation from the target material. Using this, we discuss the optimal target features for He-evaporation experiments and their range of tunability through chemical and physical modifications such as applied field and surface termination.</description>

      <title>The pathway to chirality in elemental tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral crystals, like chiral molecules, cannot be superimposed onto their mirror images -- a fundamental property that has been linked to interesting physical behavior and exploited in functional devices. Among the simplest inorganic systems with crystallographic chirality, elemental tellurium adopts structures with right- or left-handed chains. However, understanding the formation mechanisms of those structures has been difficult due to the rapid crystallization of Te, which reaches the spatial and temporal resolution limits of even the most advanced experiments. Here, we report ultra-large-scale, quantum-mechanically accurate simulations that reveal mechanisms of crystallization and the origin of crystallographic chirality in solid Te. We identify a characteristic, disordered cube-like structural motif -- a transient bonding environment with only nanosecond lifetime -- that enables the rapid crystallization of Te and mediates chirality transfer. Based on the resulting microscopic understanding, we are able to explain the switching mechanism of Te-based electrical devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Spin-Acoustic Resonance for Spin-3/2 Si Vacancy with $C_{3v}$ Site Symmetry in Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent acoustically driven spin resonance studies applied to silicon vacancy centers in silicon carbide, we theoretically investigate the spin--strain interaction characterized by the defect spin-$3/2$ quadrupole components coupled to strain fields. Considering the $C_{3v}$ symmetry of the vacancy site beyond the spherical approximation, we clarify the effect of a deviation from the spherical symmetry on spin resonance transition rate, which can be changed by rotating a static magnetic field. The ratios of spin--strain coupling parameters can be evaluated from the anisotropic field-direction dependence of the transition rate using a standing or traveling surface acoustic wave. We also discuss the effect of the propagation direction of the acoustic wave tilted from the crystallographic mirror plane reflecting the $C_{3v}$ symmetry. The results presented here reveal the quadrupole properties inherent in spin-3/2 states and will promote the realization of the acoustically driven strain control of spin.</description>

      <title>Multiple types of spin textures and robust valley physics in MP$_2$X$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both spin textures and multiple valleys in the momentum space have attracted great attentions due to their versatile applications in spintronics and valleytronics. It is highly desirable to realize multiple types of spin textures in a single material and further couple the spin textures to valley degree of freedom. Here, we study electronic properties of SnP$_{2}$Se$_{6}$ monolayer by first-principles calculations. The monolayer exhibits rare Weyl-type and Ising-type spin textures at different valleys, which can be conveniently expressed by electron and hole dopings, respectively. Besides valley-contrasting spin textures, Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall currents and optical selectivity are found to be valley dependent as well. These valley-related properties also have generalizations to SnP$_{2}$Se$_{6}$ few-layers and other MP$_{2}$X$_{6}$. Our findings open new avenue for exploring appealing interplay between spin textures and multiple valleys, and designing advanced device paradigms based on spin and valley degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may also be interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Observation of superconducting diode effect in antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>

Abstract: Nonreciprocal superconductivity, also called as superconducting diode effect that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, is characterized by asymmetric critical currents under opposite applied current directions. This distinct state unveils a rich ore of intriguing physical properties, particularly in the realm of nanoscience application of superconductors. Towards the experimental realization of superconducting diode effect, the construction of two-dimensional heterostructures of magnets and $s$-wave superconductors is considered to be a promising pathway. In this study, we present our findings of superconducting diode effect manifested in the magnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. This phenomenon is induced by the proximity effect within a van der Waals heterostructure, consisting of thin $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/NbSe$_2$ flakes. Through transport property measurements, we have confirmed a weak superconducting gap of 0.2 meV, which is significantly lower than the intrinsic gap of NbSe$_2$(1.2 meV). Upon the application of a weak magnetic field below 70 mT, we observed an asymmetry in the critical currents under positive and negative applied currents. This observation demonstrates a typical superconducting diode effect in the superconducting $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal resistance are observed exclusively when the magnetic field is aligned out-of-plane. This suggests that an Ising-type spin-orbit coupling in the superconducting $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ may be responsible for the mechanism. Our findings furnish a platform for the exploration of superconducting diode effect via the artificial construction of heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Connectivity matters: Impact of bath modes ordering and geometry in Open Quantum System simulation with Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches to perform numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment non-perturbative context, these methods require a clever choice of the topology of the wave-function Ans\"atze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. We show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable to write the joint {System + Environments} state as a matrix product state, reduce considerably the bond dimension required for convergence. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses in order to tweak tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in several applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures: dependence on the number of superconducting monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures leads to a suppression of the superconducting order parameter and appearance of spin splitting of the local electronic density of states (LDOS). In classical thin-film heterostructures with a large number of atomic layers it has been well studied. However, with the discovery of 2D materials that open up unprecedented opportunities for the design of new functional materials, an intensive study of proximity effects in van der Waals (vdW) S/F heterostructures has begun. In particular, it was shown that in monolayer S/monolayer F heterostructures the physical mechanism of the proximity effect is determined by the hybridization of their electronic states, what makes its observable manifestations completely different from the classical results and allows for effective control over the proximity effect using gate voltage. Here we demonstrate that the hybridization mechanism of the proximity effect clearly manifests itself in the evolution of the magnetic proximity effect in vdW S/F heterostructures with varying number of the superconducting layers. In particular, the number of superconducting layers determines the number of minima in the dependence of the order parameter on the ferromagnetic exchange field and gating. The spin splitting of the LDOS is very unusual and in general cannot be described by an effective Zeeman field. Physical reasons of such a behavior and possible experimental manifestations are discussed in details.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced thermal crossover in fractional Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene has attracted significant attention. One of the most intriguing observations is that the FQAH states at various fractional fillings give way to IQAH states as the temperature is lowered. In this work, we propose a mechanism for the appearance of FQAH states within a finite temperature range in a toy model. The model consists of a flat Chern band and impurities, and we analyze the effects of impurities on the system's behavior at finite temperatures. We believe that the crossover may arise from the competition between the energy penalty for thermal excitations and the increase in entropy. We support our theoretical argument with numerical calculations using exact diagonalization. Our results suggest that impurities may play a crucial role in the crossover from the FQAH to IQAH states in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene.</description>

Abstract: The interaction between surface acoustic waves and magnetization offers an efficient route for electrically controlling magnetic states. Here, we demonstrate the excitation of magnetoacoustic waves in galfenol, a highly magnetostrictive alloy made of iron (72%) and gallium (28%). We quantify the amplitude of the induced magnetization oscillations using magnetic imaging in an X-ray photoelectron microscope and estimate the dynamic magnetoelastic constants through micromagnetic simulations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of galfenol for magnonic applications and reveal that, despite strong magnetoelastic coupling, magnetic interactions and spin-wave dispersion relations significantly influence the overall amplitude of magnetoacoustic waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of the Anderson transition to quasi-random and low-dimensional realms and have garnered widespread attention. Here, we propose the asymptotic quasiperiodic two-dimensional systems characterized by a sequence of rational magnetic fluxes, which have an irrational limit, and predict exotic universal wave-packet dynamics and transport phenomena associated with the asymptotic quasiperiodicity (AQP). The predictions unveil a class of multiple metal-insulator transitions driven by a novel interplay effect between AQP, relaxation, and finite temperature, which further reveals a unified and profound mechanism. Specifically, all the transport phenomena, including the wave-packet dynamics, the bulk and edge transport, are unified in the universal scaling laws unveiled in the asymptotic quasiperiodic regime, which demonstrate a nontrivial asymptotic connection to quantum phases in the quasiperiodic limit. Our work enriches the universal quantum transport phenomena, adds to the basic mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transitions, and opens up an avenue to study the exotic transport physics with AQP in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermal conductance at interfaces between gold and amorphous silicon and amorphous silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer at the interface between two materials is becoming increasingly important as the size of electronic devices shrinks. Most studies concentrate on the interfacial thermal conductance between either crystalline-crystalline or amorphous-amorphous materials. Here, we investigate the interfacial thermal conductance at crystalline-amorphous interfaces using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, gold and two different materials, silicon and silica, in both their crystalline and amorphous structures, have been considered. The findings reveal that the interfacial thermal conductance between amorphous structures and gold is significantly higher as compared to crystalline structures for both planar and rough interfaces ($\approx$ 152 MW/(m$^2$K) for gold-amorphous silicon and $\approx$ 56 MW/(m$^2$K) for gold-crystalline silicon). We explain this increase by two factors~:~the relative commensurability between amorphous silicon/silica and gold leads to enhanced bonding and cross-correlations of atomic displacements at the interface, contributing to enhance phonon elastic transmission. Inelastic phonon transmission is also enhanced due to the relative larger degree of anharmonicity characterizing gold-amorphous silicon/silica. We also show that all the vibrational modes that participate to interfacial heat transfer are delocalized and use the Ioffe-Regel (IR) criterion to separate the contributions of propagating~(propagons) and non-propagating modes~(diffusons). In particular, we demonstrate that, while at gold-amorphous silicon interfaces elastic phonon scattering involves propagons and inelastic phonon scattering involves a mixture of propagons and diffusons, in gold-amorphous silica, all modes transmitting energy at the interface are diffusons.</description>

      <title>Dyakonov-Shur instability of electronic fluid: Spectral effect of weak magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically and analytically how the Dyakonov-Shur instability for a two-dimensional (2D) inviscid electronic fluid in a long channel can be affected by an external, out-of-plane static magnetic field. By linear stability analysis for a model based on the shallow-water equations, we describe the discrete spectrum of frequencies. When the fluid system is near the subsonic-to-supersonic transition point, a magnetically controlled gap between the stability and instability spectra of the complex eigen-frequencies is evident by our computations. This suggests that, within this model, the passage from stability to instability (and vice versa) is no longer continuous in the effective Mach parameter of the boundary conditions. We also demonstrate that the growth exponents are enhanced by the magnetic field. In a regime of weak magnetic fields, we derive a scaling law for the eigen-frequencies by perturbation theory. We discuss theoretical implications of our results in efforts to generate terahertz electromagnetic radiation by 2D electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Corner modes in non-Hermitian next-nearest-neighbor hopping model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a non-Hermitian (NH) analog of a second-order topological insulator, protected by chiral symmetry, in the presence of next-nearest neighbor hopping elements to theoretically investigate the interplay beyond the first nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes and topological order away from Hermiticity. In addition to the four zero-energy corner modes present in the first nearest neighbor hopping model, we uncover that the second nearest neighbor hopping introduces another topological phase with sixteen zero-energy corner modes. Importantly, the NH effects are manifested in altering the Hermitian phase boundaries for both the models. While comparing the complex energy spectrum under open boundary conditions, and bi-orthogonalized quadrupolar winding number in real space, we resolve the apparent anomaly in the bulk boundary correspondence of the NH system as compared to the Hermitian counterpart by incorporating the effect of non-Bloch form of momentum into the mass term. The above invariant is also capable of capturing the phase boundaries between the two different topological phases where the degeneracy of the corner modes is evident, as exclusively observed for the second nearest neighbor model.</description>

      <title>On the average spin Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the average spin Chern number (ASCN) as an indicator of the topological significance of the spin degree of freedom within insulating materials. Whenever this number is a non-zero even integer, it distinguishes the material as a spin Chern insulator, and the number is a topological invariant whenever there is a symmetry that commutes with the spin and protects Chern numbers. If this number is not zero, it indicates that the material has non-trivial spin transport properties, and it lies close to the value of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) within the bandgap. For systems where the spin commutes with the Hamiltonian, the ASCN matches the SHC. When the non-commutativity of the spin with the Hamiltonian cannot be neglected, both values are non-zero simultaneously. The ASCN is therefore a good complement for the intrinsic contribution of the SHC, and permits to detect topological information of the material which is not possible alone from the value of the SHC.</description>

      <title>First-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity in amorphous superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic trait involves scaling laws governing a second-order, gradual suppression of the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here, we show a departure from this paradigm, showcasing that amorphous superconducting films of indium oxide undergo a distinctive, discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition tuned by disorder. Through systematic measurements of the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators, we provide evidence for a marked jump of both the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This discontinuous transition sheds light on the previously overlooked role of repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, our investigation shows that the critical temperature of the films no longer relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness, consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings raise fundamental new questions into the role of disorder in quantum phase transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: Unlike charge, heat flows are difficult to control. We show that, in mesoscopic conductors, electronic thermal currents can be manipulated with a magnetic field by using the Aharonov-Bohm effect: the magnetic control of the interference pattern enhances the thermoelectric effect, while heat transport can be totally suppressed. In a three-terminal configuration, the flux-induced broken reciprocity generates a non-local thermoelectric response and translates to the circulation of heat. This way, efficient thermoelectric generators, thermal switches and thermal circulators, as well as energy harvesters can be defined for minimally disturbing thermal management at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Computing Floquet quasienergies in finite and extended systems: Role of electromagnetic and quantum-geometric gauges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to compute the Floquet quasienergy spectrum of time-periodic systems. The method allows to characterize the light-matter interaction in finite and extended structures by carefully addressing the resolution of the position operator. In periodic systems we discuss the role of the quantum-geometric gauge freedom of Bloch states and employ a Wannier-based scheme to compute the required matrix elements. As a consequence, the method is accurate and applicable to a broad range of systems, from atoms and molecules to cold atomic gases and materials described by density functional theory, as well as model systems. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by studying two cases: a particle trapped in a one-dimensional box and the semiconducting material BC$_2$N. We employ the first example to provide a numerical proof of the invariance of the Floquet quasienergy spectrum with respect to the choice of electromagnetic gauge. The analysis of BC$_2$N then serves to illustrate the physical effects described by the quasienergies, such as multiphoton resonances, and their expected range of occurrence in real materials in terms of external electric field and frequency of the drive pulse.</description>

      <title>How to accurately measure the mobility and viscosity of two-dimensional carriers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a hydrodynamic behavior of ultrahigh mobility viscous two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well was intensively studied based on relevant negative magnetoresistance (NMR) data. The two-dimensional Gurzhi model with(without) simplification combined with extra assumptions on electron-electron collisions rate often lead to a certain agreement with experiment. We provide ab initio analysis of the NMR data[Q. Shi et al, Phys. Rev. B. 89, 201301(R) (2014)] and demonstrate exceptional agreement with the uncut Gurzhi model attracting a single fitting parameter of the effective stream width. Our approach allows one to identify the intrinsic carrier mobility higher than that deduced by conventional methods. The NMR data analysis is proposed for powerful tool for two-dimensional viscometry.</description>

      <title>Redshit as a stretching factor in rotating graphene wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss an extension of the geometric description of graphene wormholes in a non-inertial situation. We present an effective metric that describes the wormhole connection between two graphene sheets with matter content in rotation. Additionally, a stretching term as a function of the classical redshift of space has been found and discussed. We also explore the influence of a rotation term on quantum holonomy, recovering previous results found for the static case.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of many-body states by the ponderomotive potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ponderomotive force is an effective static force that a particle feels in an oscillating field, whose static potential may be called the ponderomotive potential. We generalize this notion to periodically driven quantum many-body systems, and propose it as a convenient tool to engineer their non-equilibrium steady states beyond the single particle level. Applied to materials driven by light, the ponderomotive potential is intimately related to the equilibrium optical conductivity, which is enhanced close to resonances. We show that the ponderomotive potential from the incident light may be used to induce exciton condensates in semiconductors, to generate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity in certain electron-phonon systems, and to create additional free energy minima in systems with charge/spin/excitonic orders. These effects are presented with experimentally relevant parameters.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Interactions mediated by atoms, photons, electrons, and excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between quasiparticles mediated by a surrounding environment are ubiquitous and lead to a range of important effects from collective modes of low temperature quantum gases, superconductivity, to the interaction between elementary particles at high energies. This perspective article is motivated by experimental progress in the fields of quantum degenerate atomic gases, cavity QED, and two-dimensional (2D) semi-conductors, which enable a systematic exploration of mediated interactions in new settings and regimes. We first describe how to microscopically calculate the quasiparticle interaction using perturbation theory, diagrammatics, and the path integral, highlighting the key role played by the quantum statistics of the quasiparticles. Recent theoretical and experimental insights into quasiparticle and mediated interactions in general obtained from atomic gases are then discussed, after which we focus on hybrid light-atom systems where a remarkable long range photon mediated interaction can be realised. Next, we describe new and puzzling results regarding the interaction between quasiparticles in 2D semiconductors. We then discuss how mediated interactions open up ways to realise new quantum phases in atomic and hybrid atom-photon systems as well as 2D semiconductors, and the perspective ends by posing some open questions and outlook.</description>

      <title>Driving noncollinear interlayer exchange coupling intrinsically in magnetic trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic side layers sandwiching a nonmagnetic spacer as a metallic trilayer has become a pivotal platform for achieving spintronic devices. Recent experiments demonstrate that manipulating the width or the nature of conducting spacer induces noncollinear magnetic alignment between the side layers. Our theoretical analysis reveals that altering the width of spacer significantly affects the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC), resulting in noncollinear alignment. Through analytic and first-principles methods, our study on the Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer shows that at a specific width of the Ag spacer, the magnetic moments of side layers tend to be perpendicular. This alignment is mediated by Ag quantum well states, exhibiting spin spirals across the trilayer. Our results reveal that the noncollinear IEC offers a degree of freedom to control magnetic devices and boot spintronic technology with improved transport capabilities.</description>
