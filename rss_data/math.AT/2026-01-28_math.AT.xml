      <title>Reliable Topology for Dynamic Data: Mathematical Foundations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across many scientific domains, practitioners rely on coarse, discretized summaries to track the evolving structure of complex systems under noise, measurement error, and changing system size. Understanding when such summaries are reliable -- and when apparent robustness is illusory -- remains a fundamental challenge. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a case study: Crocker diagrams track the number of topological features across spatial scale and time, and because they are computationally efficient and easy to interpret, they have been widely used for exploratory analysis, bifurcation detection, model selection, and parameter inference. Despite their popularity, Crocker diagrams have lacked rigorous stability guarantees ensuring robustness to small data distortions. We develop a conditional stability theory for Crocker diagrams constructed from evolving point clouds. Our main results include deterministic conditions guaranteeing exact invariance when pairwise distances are well separated from the diagram's discretization thresholds, together with bounds on how much the diagrams can change when these conditions fail. We also establish probabilistic stability guarantees under Gaussian noise and bounds on topological change caused by adding or removing points, scaling linearly with the number of modified points. We illustrate these results using two complementary examples: an analytically tractable breathing polygon model that reveals how stability thresholds depend on geometry, and a feasibility analysis of epithelial cell imaging data showing when bounded-change guarantees provide the appropriate robustness framework. Together, these results reveal a two-tier stability structure for coarse, discretized topological summaries: exact invariance under verifiable geometric separation conditions, and geometry-controlled bounded change otherwise.</description>

      <title>Relative Obstructions and Spectral Diagnostics for Sheaves on Cell Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many structured systems admit locally consistent descriptions that nevertheless fail to globalize when constrained by an ambient reference or feasibility condition. Diagnosing such failures is naturally an evaluative problem: given a fixed model and a grounding, can one determine whether they are structurally compatible, and if not, identify the nature and localization of the obstruction?
  In this work, we introduce a sheaf-theoretic and spectral framework for evaluating structural inconsistency as a \emph{relative} phenomenon. A model is represented by a cellular sheaf $\mathcal F$ on a cell complex, together with a morphism into a grounding sheaf $\mathcal W$ encoding admissible global behavior. Failure of compatibility is captured by the mapping cone of this morphism, whose cohomology computes the relative groups $H^*(K;\mathcal F,\mathcal W)$ and separates intrinsic obstructions from inconsistencies induced by the grounding.
  Beyond exact cohomological classification, we develop \emph{spectral witnesses} derived from regular and mapping-cone Laplacians. The spectra of these operators provide computable, quantitative indicators of inconsistency, encoding both robustness and spatial localization through spectral gaps, integrated energies, and eigenmode support. These witnesses enable comparison of distinct inconsistency mechanisms in fixed systems without learning, optimization, or modification of the underlying representation.
  The proposed framework is domain-agnostic and applies to a broad class of structured models where feasibility is enforced locally but evaluated globally.</description>

      <title>Embeddable partial groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We record a folklore theorem that says a partial group embeds in a group if and only if each word has at most one possible multiplication, regardless of choice of parenthesization. We further investigate the partial groups which are exemplars of non-embeddability. Finally we show that a partial groupoid embeds in a groupoid if and only if its reduction embeds in a group.</description>

      <title>A CW complex homotopy equivalent to spaces of locally convex curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally convex curves in the sphere $S^n$ have been studied for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations. Taking Frenet frames obtains corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$; $\Pi: Spin_{n+1} \to Flag_{n+1}$ is the universal cover of the space of flags. Determining the homotopy type of spaces of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed initial and final points appears to be a hard problem. We may focus on $L_n$, the space of locally convex curves $\Gamma: [0,1] \to Spin_{n+1}$ with $\Gamma(0) = 1$, $\Pi(\Gamma(1)) = \Pi(1)$. Convex curves form a contractible connected component of $L_n$; there are $2^{n+1}$ other components, one for each endpoint. The homotopy type of $L_n$ has so far been determined only for $n=2$. This paper is a step towards solving the problem for larger values of $n$.
  The itinerary of $\Gamma$ belongs to $W_n$, the set of finite words in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \setminus \{e\}$. The itinerary of a curve lists the non open Bruhat cells crossed. Itineraries stratify the space $L_n$. We construct a CW complex $D_n$ which is a kind of dual of $L_n$ under this stratification: the construction is similar to Poincar\'e duality. The CW complex $D_n$ is homotopy equivalent to $L_n$. The cells of $D_n$ are naturally labeled by words in $W_n$; $D_n$ is locally finite. Explicit glueing instructions are described for lower dimensions.
  We describe an open subset $Y_n \subset L_n$, a union of strata of $L_n$. In each non convex component of $L_n$, the intersection with $Y_n$ is connected and dense. Most connected components of $L_n$ are contained in $Y_n$. For $n &gt; 3$, in the other components the complement of $Y_n$ has codimension at least $2$. The set $Y_n$ is homotopy equivalent to the disjoint union of $2^{n+1}$ copies of $\Omega Spin_{n+1}$. For all $n \ge 2$, all connected components of $L_n$ are simply connected.</description>
