      <title>A convergence law for continuous logic and continuous structures with finite domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider continuous relational structures with finite domain $[n] := \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and a many valued logic, $CLA$, with values in the unit interval and which uses continuous connectives and continuous aggregation functions. $CLA$ subsumes first-order logic on ``conventional'' finite structures. To each relation symbol $R$ and identity constraint $ic$ on a tuple the length of which matches the arity of $R$ we associate a continuous probability density function $\mu_R^{ic} : [0, 1] \to [0, \infty)$.
  We also consider a probability distribution on the set $\mathbf{W}_n$ of continuous structures with domain $[n]$ which is such that for every relation symbol $R$, identity constraint $ic$, and tuple $\bar{a}$ satisfying $ic$, the distribution of the value of $R(\bar{a})$ is given by $\mu_R^{ic}$, independently of the values for other relation symbols or other tuples.
  In this setting we prove that every formula in $CLA$ is asymptotically equivalent to a formula without any aggregation function. This is used to prove a convergence law for $CLA$ which reads as follows for formulas without free variables: If $\varphi \in CLA$ has no free variable and $I \subseteq [0, 1]$ is an interval, then there is $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ such that, as $n$ tends to infinity, the probability that the value of $\varphi$ is in $I$ tends to $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Strategies: Definability and the Tensor Completeness Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programs that combine I/O and countable probabilistic choice, modulo either bisimilarity or trace equivalence, can be seen as describing a probabilistic strategy. For well-founded programs, we might expect to axiomatize bisimilarity via a sum of equational theories and trace equivalence via a tensor of such theories. This is by analogy with similar results for nondeterminism, established previously.
  While bisimilarity is indeed axiomatized via a sum of theories, and the tensor is indeed at least sound for trace equivalence, completeness in general, remains an open problem. Nevertheless, we show completeness in the case that either the probabilistic choice or the I/O operations used are finitary. We also show completeness up to impersonation, i.e. that the tensor theory regards trace equivalent programs as solving the same system of equations. This entails completeness up to the cancellation law of the probabilistic choice operator.
  Furthermore, we show that a probabilistic trace strategy arises as the semantics of a well-founded program iff it is victorious. This means that, when the strategy is played against any partial counterstrategy, the probability of play continuing forever is zero.</description>

      <title>Simplified and Verified: A Second Look at a Proof-Producing Union-Find Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Isabelle/HOL, we verify a union-find data structure with an explain operation due to Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras. We devise a simpler, more naive version of the explain operation whose soundness and completeness is easy to verify. Then, we prove the original formulation of the explain operation to be equal to our version. Finally, we refine this data structure to Imperative HOL, enabling us to export efficient imperative code. The formalisation provides a stepping stone towards the verification of proof-producing congruence closure algorithms which are a core ingredient of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers.</description>

      <title>Cumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a widely adopted specification language in cyber-physical systems for expressing critical temporal requirements, such as safety conditions and response time. However, STL's expressivity is not sufficient to capture the cumulative duration during which a property holds within an interval of time. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Cumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic (CT-STL) that operates over discrete-time signals and extends STL with a new cumulative-time operator. This operator compares the sum of all time steps for which its nested formula is true with a threshold. We present both a qualitative and a quantitative (robustness) semantics for CT-STL and prove both their soundness and completeness properties. We provide an efficient online monitoring algorithm for both semantics. Finally, we show the applicability of CT-STL in two case studies: specifying and monitoring cumulative temporal requirements for a microgrid and an artificial pancreas.</description>

      <title>Hofmann-Streicher lifting of fibred categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1997, Hofmann and Streicher introduced an explicit construction to lift a Grothendieck universe $\mathcal{U}$ from $\mathbf{Set}$ into the category of $\mathbf{Set}$-valued presheaves on a $\mathcal{U}$-small category $B$. More recently, Awodey presented an elegant functorial analysis of this construction in terms of the categorical nerve, the right adjoint to the functor that takes a presheaf to its category of elements; in particular, the categorical nerve's functorial action on the universal $\mathcal{U}$-small discrete fibration gives the generic family of $\mathcal{U}$'s Hofmann-Streicher lifting. Inspired by Awodey's analysis, we define a relative version of Hofmann-Streicher lifting in terms of the right pseudo-adjoint to the 2-functor $\mathbf{Fib}_{A}\to\mathbf{Fib}_{B}$ given by postcomposition with a fibration $p\colon A\to B$.</description>

      <title>Extensional Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a calculus of extensional resource terms. These are resource terms \`a la Ehrhard-Regnier, but in infinitely eta-long form. The calculus still retains a finite syntax and dynamics: in particular, we prove strong confluence and normalization.
  Then we define an extensional version of Taylor expansion, mapping ordinary lambda-terms to (possibly infinite) linear combinations of extensional resource terms: like in the ordinary case, the dynamics of our resource calculus allows us to simulate the beta-reduction of lambda-terms; the extensional nature of this expansion shows in the fact that we are also able to simulate eta-reduction.
  In a sense, extensional resource terms contain a language of finite approximants of Nakajima trees, much like ordinary resource terms can be seen as a richer version of finite B\"ohm trees. We show that the equivalence induced on lambda-terms by the normalization of extensional Taylor-expansion is nothing but H*, the greatest consistent sensible lambda-theory - which is also the theory induced by Nakajima trees. This characterization provides a new, simple way to exhibit models of H*: it becomes sufficient to model the extensional resource calculus and its dynamics.
  The extensional resource calculus moreover allows us to recover, in an untyped setting, a connection between Taylor expansion and game semantics that was previously limited to the typed setting. Indeed, simply typed, eta-long, beta-normal resource terms are known to be in bijective correspondence with plays in the sense of Hyland-Ong game semantics, up to Melli\`es' homotopy equivalence. Extensional resource terms are the appropriate counterpart of eta-long resource terms in an untyped setting: we spell out the bijection between normal extensional resource terms and isomorphism classes of augmentations (a canonical presentation of plays up to homotopy) in the universal arena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03894v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forge connections between the theory of fractal sets obtained as attractors of iterated function systems and process calculi. To this end, we reinterpret Milner's expressions for processes as contraction operators on a complete metric space. When the space is, for example, the plane, the denotations of fixed point terms correspond to familiar fractal sets. We give a sound and complete axiomatization of fractal equivalence, the congruence on terms consisting of pairs that construct identical self-similar sets in all interpretations. We further make connections to labelled Markov chains and to invariant measures. In all of this work, we use important results from process calculi. For example, we use Rabinovich's completeness theorem for trace equivalence in our own completeness theorem. In addition to our results, we also raise many questions related to both fractals and process calculi.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>

      <title>Verification of Linear Dynamical Systems via O-Minimality of the Real Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete-time linear dynamical system (LDS) is given by an update matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, and has the trajectories $\langle s, Ms, M^2s, \ldots \rangle$ for $s \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Reachability-type decision problems of linear dynamical systems, most notably the Skolem Problem, lie at the forefront of decidability: typically, sound and complete algorithms are known only in low dimensions, and these rely on sophisticated tools from number theory and Diophantine approximation. Recently, however, o-minimality has emerged as a counterpoint to these number-theoretic tools that allows us to decide certain modifications of the classical problems of LDS without any dimension restrictions. In this paper, we first introduce the Decomposition Method, a framework that captures all applications of o-minimality to decision problems of LDS that are currently known to us. We then use the Decomposition Method to show decidability of the Robust Safety Problem (restricted to bounded initial sets) in arbitrary dimension: given a matrix $M$, a bounded semialgebraic set $S$ of initial points, and a semialgebraic set $T$ of unsafe points, it is decidable whether there exists $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that all orbits that begin in the $\varepsilon$-ball around $S$ avoid $T$.</description>

      <title>Prophecies all the Way: Game-based Model-Checking for HyperQPTL beyond $\forall^*\exists^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-checking HyperLTL, a temporal logic expressing properties of sets of traces with applications to information-flow based security and privacy, has a decidable, but TOWER-complete, model-checking problem. In the classical algorithm, the complexity manifests itself with a need for the complementation of automata over infinite words. To overcome this aforementioned need, a game-based alternative for the $\forall^*\exists^*$-fragment was recently presented.
  Here, we employ imperfect information-games to extend the game-based approach to full HyperQPTL, i.e., we allow arbitrary quantifier prefixes and quantification over propositions, which allows us to express every $\omega$-regular hyperproperty. As a byproduct of our game-based algorithm, we obtain finite-state implementations of Skolem functions via transducers with lookahead that explain satisfaction or violation of HyperQPTL properties.</description>

      <title>Constructibility, computational complexity and P versus NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decision problem called the IPL problem is defined, and it is argued for the validity of an associated thesis called the IPL thesis. This thesis states that for some instances of the IPL problem, while an algorithm for verifying correct solutions to the problem in polynomial time is explicitly constructible, the IPL problem itself is algorithmically unsolvable in the sense that no explicitly constructed algorithm can be verified as solving the problem. Thus under a constructive interpretation of algorithmic complexity classes, which is arguably their only meaningful interpretation, the IPL thesis implies that NP is not contained in any complexity class consisting of algorithmically solvable problems. In particular, the thesis implies a solution to the P versus NP problem: P is not equal to NP. It also implies that NP is not contained in larger complexity classes such as EXPTIME, seemingly contradicting known results. However, the proofs of the these results all tacitly employ an existence assumption which according to the IPL thesis, does not hold for the IPL problem under a constructive interpretation of algorithmic complexity classes.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness for Search and Undecidability of PCSP Meta-Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an open question whether the search and decision versions of promise CSPs are equivalent. Most known algorithms for PCSPs solve only their \emph{decision} variant, and it is unknown whether they can be adapted to solve \emph{search} as well. The main approaches, called BLP, AIP and BLP+AIP, handle a PCSP by finding a solution to a relaxation of some integer program. We prove that rounding those solutions to a proper search certificate can be as hard as any problem in the class TFNP. In other words, these algorithms are ineffective for search. Building on the algebraic approach to PCSPs, we find sufficient conditions that imply ineffectiveness for search. Our tools are tailored to algorithms that are characterized by minions in a suitable way, and can also be used to prove undecidability results for meta-problems. This way, we show that the families of templates solvable via BLP, AIP, and BLP+AIP are undecidable.
  Using the same techniques we also analyze several algebraic conditions that are known to guarantee the tractability of finite-template CSPs. We prove that several meta-problems related to cyclic polymorphims and WNUs are undecidable for PCSPs. In particular, there is no algorithm deciding whether a finite PCSP template (1) admits cyclic a polymorphism, (2) admits a WNU.</description>
