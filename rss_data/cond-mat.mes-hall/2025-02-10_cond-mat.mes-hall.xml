      <title>Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Field-free Deterministic Magnetic Switching of all-van der Waals Spin-Orbit Torque System Using Spin Ensembles in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, optically active spin defects embedded in van der Waals (vdW) crystals have emerged as a transformative quantum sensing platform to explore cutting-edge materials science and quantum physics. Taking advantage of excellent solid-state integrability, this new class of spin defects can be arranged in controllable nanoscale proximity of target materials in vdW heterostructures, showing great promise for improving spatial resolution and field sensitivity of current sensing technologies. Building on this state-of-the-art measurement platform, here we report hexagonal boron nitride-based quantum imaging of field-free deterministic magnetic switching of room-temperature two-dimensional magnet Fe3GaTe2 in an all-vdW spin-orbit torque (SOT) system. By visualizing SOT-driven variations of nanoscale Fe3GaTe2 magnetic stray field profile under different conditions, we have revealed how the observed magnetic switching evolves from deterministic to indeterministic behavior due to the interplay between out-of-plane spins, in-plane spins and Joule heating. This understanding, which is otherwise difficult to access by conventional transport measurements, offers valuable insights on material design, testing, and evaluation of next-generation vdW spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</description>

      <title>Coherent spin dynamics in ensembles of randomly oriented singly charged colloidal nanoplatelets and nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the pump-probe Faraday rotation and ellipticity signals in ensembles of uniaxially anisotropic CdSe nanoplatelets and nanocrystals. We use the Faraday rotation mechanism based on the excitation of negative heavy hole trions for a magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry. Three types of ensembles with typical spatial distributions of the orientation of the anisotropy axis with respect to the direction of light propagation are considered. Faraday rotation and ellipticity signals are modeled for excitation by single and repeated pump pulses, taking into account the anisotropy of the electron g-factor. We show that spin dephasing caused by the electron g-factor anisotropy and the arbitrary orientation of nanoplatelets or nanocrystals result only in partial damping of oscillation amplitude in contrast to the dephasing caused by the dispersion of the electron g-factor in the ensemble. We demonstrate that regardless of the g-factor anisotropy degree the oscillation frequency of the Faraday rotation and ellipticity signals for a randomly oriented ensemble is determined by the transverse electron g-factor component.</description>

      <title>Wannier interpolation of spin accumulation coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall (SH) effect is widely understood as a phenomoenon in which spin current flows perpendicular to an electric field. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling, however, spin current is ambiguous, and the SH conductivity depends on the definition of spin current. In this article, we develop an \textit{ab initio} computational scheme for the spin accumulation coefficient, which characterizes the spin accumulation and would be an alternative indicator of the SH effect. The proposed method has been implemented into an open-source software Wannier90 and serves high-precision \textit{ab initio} research on the SH effect.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics in linear-time beyond the wide-band limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium heat transport in quantum systems coupled to wide-band embeddings provides a striking example of the limitations of the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), while solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations remains computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, we propose an iterated solution to the reconstruction problem, resulting in a time-linear evolution scheme involving 14 correlators for systems with narrow-band embeddings. This approach eliminates GKBA-related artifacts and resolves convergence issues associated with the wide-band limit. Furthermore, it enables the calculation of energy- and time-resolved currents, facilitating the modeling of heat flows in quantum systems and energy- and time-resolved photoemission experiments, all at significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Knudsen effect signaling long-lived modes in 2D electron gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper analysis of electron collisions in two spatial dimensions leads to the conclusion, that the odd harmonics of the electron distribution function decay much slower than the even ones at finite temperatures. The number of long-lived odd harmonics quickly shrinks with increasing temperature. Focusing on a channel geometry with boundary scattering, we show that such behavior of the odd decay rates leads to a characteristic behaviour of the conductance that we dub anomalous Knudsen effect: it initially grows with temperature but then starts to decrease, forming a peak. Further increase of the temperature forces the conductance to grow again due to the Gurzhi effect, associated with the crossover from ballistic to hydrodynamic transport. The simultaneous observation of the Gurzhi dip preceded by the anomalous Knudsen peak constitutes a particular signature of the long-lived modes in 2D electron transport at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Sign-reversal and non-monotonicity of chirality-related anomalous Hall effect in highly conductive metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-monotonic temperature dependence and sign reversal of chirality-related anomalous Hall effect in highly conductive metals are studied. Through the analysis of scattering rate, we find that the non-monotonicity and sign reversal have two major origins: (1) competition between the contribution from short-range and long-range spin correlations and (2) non-monotonic spin correlation in the high field. The former mechanism gives rise to non-monotonic temperature dependence in a wide range of electron density and, in some cases, a sign reversal of Hall resistivity as the temperature decreases. On the other hand, the latter mechanism is responsible for the sign reversal of Hall conductivity in the high field, which sign reversal generally occurs in magnets with antiferromagnetic interactions. The results demonstrate how the Hall effect reflects local spin correlation and provide insights into the mechanism of non-monotonicity and sign reversal of the anomalous Hall effect by spin chirality.</description>

      <title>The non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics of a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity breaks down the adiabaticity and naturally leads to the non-Abelian behaviors in multi-band systems. Here we consider a multi-band, non-Hermitian ladder model with the two legs being the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. We thoroughly study how the non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics emerge in this model at the onset of inter-leg coupling. Under periodic boundary conditions, by defining a gauge-invariant winding number for chiral symmetric systems, we analytically give the exact topological phase diagram. With the aid of underlying symmetries generalized for non-Hermitian systems, we further refine the phase diagram by the geometry of band structure. In the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime, we find that the stable non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state under an external constant force can be well described in some conditions of the force by the Wilson line constructed for non-Hermitian systems. Under open boundary conditions, we also find that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit but breaks down for finite-size systems with the leg-dependent non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), demonstrating the so-called critical NHSE, of which the decaying length of the bulk skin modes $\xi$ varies with the system size $L$ and is numerically verified to satisfy the scale-free power law $\xi\propto L$. Our work may stimulate more focuses on the non-Abelian properties of the non-Hermitian/open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optical orientation of excitons and charged carriers in MAPbI$_3$ perovskite single crystals in the orthorhombic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical orientation of exciton and carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the basic phenomenon in the spin physics of semiconductors. Here, we investigate spin orientation in MAPbI3 lead halide perovskite crystals at the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K, where the material has an orthorhombic crystal structure. The recombination and spin dynamics of excitons and carriers are measured by time-resolved photoluminescence after circularly polarized excitation. The optical orientation of excitons reaches 85\%, which persists within their lifetime of 15-80 ps. This high orientation is maintained for excitation laser detunings from the exciton resonance to higher energies by up to 0.3 eV, then decreases and vanishes above 1.5 eV detuning. This indicates that the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism based on inversion symmetry breaking is inactive in MAPbI3 crystals with orthorhombic symmetry. The optical orientation of localized and spatially-separated electrons and holes results in 40\% circular polarization of their emission. Their contributions can be identified from the complex spin beats dynamics in transverse magnetic field. The dynamics analysis gives values of the Land\'e g-factors of 2.83 for electrons and 0.54 for holes. Also, the magnetic-field-induced polarization of excitons and carriers is analyzed in magnetic fields up to 6 T, showing that their spin relaxation times are longer than their lifetimes. Namely, for the excitons, the spin relaxation time exceeds the lifetime by a factor of 6. We model the dynamics of optical orientation degree for cumulative contributions of excitons and carriers and show that the exciton recombination dynamics can control these dynamics. The polarized emission of excitons and localized carriers, produced by their polarization on Zeeman-split levels in magnetic fields, is modeled.</description>

      <title>Kerr non-linearity enhances the response of a graphene Josephson bolometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly sensitive, broadband bolometers are of great interest because of their versatile usage in wide areas starting from dark matter search, radio astronomy, material science, and qubit readouts in cQED experiments. There have been different realizations of bolometers using superconducting thin films, nanowires, quantum dots, and various 2D materials in the recent past. The challenge is to have a single device that combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, a fast readout mechanism, and low noise. Here we demonstrate the first usage of a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) as a highly sensitive bolometer. Our key finding is the Kerr non-linearity of the JPA boosts the device's sensitivity. When the bolometer is biased in the non-linear regime, it enhances the sideband signals (~100 times), resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the linear regime. In the non-linear biasing of the device, we achieve a NEP~500 aW/sqrt(Hz). Our bolometer offers a fast detection scheme with a thermal time constant of 4.26 us and an intrinsic JPA time constant of 70 ns. Our device's broadband and fast operation are key and new compared to previously studied graphene-based bolometers. In our device, the gate voltage tunability and the possibility of multiplexing combined with the sensitive bolometric performance offer an opportunity for integrated quantum sensor arrays. Our work demonstrates a way forward to enhance the performance of quantum sensors based on 2D materials by leveraging the inherent non-linear response.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian topological disclination states and charge fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been significant interest in exploring topological disclination states, which effectively probe the band topology of the host material beyond the conventional bulk-edge correspondence. While most studies in this area have primarily focused on Hermitian systems, recent theoretical work predicts that non-Hermiticity can drive topological phase transitions and host topological disclination states associated with fractional charge. However, no experimental observations have been reported to date. Here, we report the first experimental observation of topological disclination states in electric circuits, induced solely by gain and loss. Through admittance matrix measurements and eigenstate analysis, we confirm their emergence and compute the corresponding fractional charge. Moreover, the disclination mode profile and localization effect can be directly visualized via monochromatic field excitation. Additionally, we demonstrate the emergence of degenerate zero-energy topological disclination states, devoid of fractional charge, in distinct non-Hermitian geometries. Our findings open the possibility of non-Hermiticity-induced fractional charges in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, which may pave the way for advancements in active topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced spin selectivity based on orbital Edelstein effect in an analytically solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity, a phenomenon wherein chiral structures selectively determine the spin polarization of electron currents flowing through the material, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as spintronics, enantioseparation, and catalysis. The underlying physical effect is the Edelstein effect that converts charge to angular momentum but the precise mechanism remains yet to be understood. Here, we introduce the minimal model for explaining the phenomenon based on the orbital Edelstein effect. We consider inter-site contributions to the current-induced orbital angular momentum and reveal the underlying mechanism by analytically calculating the Edelstein susceptibilities in a tight-binding and Boltzmann approach. While the orbital angular momentum is directly generated by the chirality of the crystal, the spin contribution of each spin-split band pair relies on spin-orbit coupling. Using tellurium as an example, we show that the orbital contribution surpasses the spin contribution by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Observation of a dynamic magneto-chiral instability in photoexcited tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a system of charged chiral fermions driven out of equilibrium, an electric current parallel to the magnetic field can generate a dynamic instability by which electromagnetic waves become amplified. Whether a similar instability can occur in chiral solid-state systems remains an open question. Using time-domain terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, we detect signatures of what we dub a ``dynamic magneto-chiral instability" in elemental tellurium, a structurally chiral crystal. Upon transient photoexcitation in a moderate external magnetic field, tellurium emits THz radiation consisting of coherent modes that amplify over time. An explanation for this amplification is proposed using a theoretical model based on a dynamic instability of electromagnetic waves interacting with infrared-active oscillators of impurity acceptor states in tellurium to form an amplifying polariton.

      <title>Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting critical dynamics and vortex fluctuations in a high-temperature cuprate</title>

Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Enhanced chemical vapour deposition of monolayer MoS2 films via a clean promoter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), exemplified by molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have shown exceptional potential for data-centred, energy-efficient electronic applications due to their unique electrical, optoelectronic, and mechanical properties. However, challenges such as the controllable synthesis of high-quality, large-area 2D MoS2 films and the mitigation of contamination during growth remain significant barriers to their integration into advanced technologies. Here, we developed a novel contamination-free growth promoter, enabling the clean and scalable synthesis of high quality 2D MoS2 with desirable grain structures via chemical vapour deposition (CVD). By optimising the reactant concentration and S/Mo ratio, we achieved promoter-dominated enhanced growth with enhanced quality, as evidenced by the increased MoS2 flake size and coverage, alongside a strong PL A exciton peak at 1.84 eV, matching that of the mechanically exfoliated sample. This approach facilitates the clean and site-specific growth of high-quality 2D MoS2, establishing a robust pathway for the practical implementation of 2D MoS2 in next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Strongly dispersive dielectric properties of high-ScN-fraction ScAlN deposited by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of dielectric properties including complex permittivity, loss, and leakage of high-ScN-fraction ScAlN thin films grown using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Dielectric spectroscopy is carried out on high-ScN-fraction (30%-40% ScN fraction) samples from 20 Hz to 10 GHz. We find that real permittivity {\epsilon}' increases significantly with increasing ScN fraction; a trend confirmed by density functional theory. Further, {\epsilon}' is strongly dispersive with frequency and increasing ScN fraction, with values for Sc0.4Al0.6N varying from 150 down to 60 with increasing frequency. Loss, dispersion, and DC leakage current correspondingly increase with ScN fraction. The high {\epsilon}' and strongly dispersive behavior in MBE ScAlN are not observed in a sputter-deposited ScAlN control with a similar ScN fraction, highlighting fundamental differences between films produced by the two deposition methods. Microscopy and spectroscopy analyses are carried out on MBE- and sputter-deposited samples to compare microstructure, alloy, and dopant concentration.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be respected even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators and the anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. We then generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstate can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Thus, eta-pairing may represent a new mechanism for skin effects in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in higher dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry. To realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena, we construct a general two-sublattice model defined on an arbitrary lattice, which can exhibit anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates; besides, this model can reveal the eta-pairing structure [e.g., the $SO(4)$ symmetry] in systems with Hermitian hoppings.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Factors Governing Stabilization of Janus 2D-Bulk Heterostructures with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The more-than-6000 2D materials predicted thus far provide a huge combinatorial space for forming functional heterostructures with bulk materials, with potential applications in nanoelectronics, sensing, and energy conversion. In this work, we investigate nearly 1000 heterostructures, the largest number of heterostructures thus far, of 2D Janus and bulk materials' surfaces using ab initio simulations and machine learning (ML) to deduce the structure-property relationships of the complex interfaces in such heterostructures. We first perform van der Waals-corrected density functional theory simulations using a high-throughput computational framework on 51 Janus 2D materials and 19 metallic, cubic phase, elemental bulk materials that exhibit low lattice mismatches and low coincident site lattices. The formation energy of the resultant 1147 Janus 2D-bulk heterostructures were analyzed and 828 were found to be thermodynamically stable. ML models were trained on the computed data, and we found that they could predict the binding energy and $z$-separation of 2D-bulk heterostructures with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.05 eV/atom and 0.14 angstroms, respectively. The feature importance of the models reveals that the properties of the bulk materials dominate the heterostructures' energies and interfacial structures heavily. These findings are in-line with experimentally observed behavior of several well-known 2D materials-bulk systems. The data used within this paper is freely available in the Ab Initio 2D-Bulk Heterostructure Database (aiHD). The fundamental insights on 2D-bulk heterostructures and the predictive ML models developed in this work could accelerate the application of thousands of 2D-bulk heterostructures, thus stimulating research within a wide range of electronic, quantum computing, sensing, and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Unraveling effects of competing interactions and frustration in vdW ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 nanoflake devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets and devices have garnered significant attention owing to the stabilization of long range magnetic order down to atomic limit, and the prospect for novel quantum devices with unique functionalities. To achieve this objective, clarification of magnetotransport properties and understanding of the relevant interactions with lowering of dimensions are of extreme importance. Here, the magnetotransport properties of few atomic layer Fe3GeTe2 and (Co0.25Fe0.75)3GeTe2 nanoflake devices have been investigated. Magnetotransport investigations with applied magnetic field along the easy-axis shows anomalous Hall effect, while that for applied magnetic field along the hard-axis reveals an unusual behaviour. Atomistic calculations considering the presence of antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic and local symmetry-breaking interactions reveal critical role of magnetic frustration effect assisted by thermal fluctuations, leading to a non-zero scalar spin chirality manifesting in an unconventional Hall effect. The present result clarifies the underlying interactions in few-layer 2D vdW ferromagnetic material system, important for the understanding of non-collinear spin configurations in vdW magnets for 2D spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Method to Decipher "Genome" from Interatomic Cohesion in the Exploration for a "Central Dogma" Replacement in Material Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ball-stick model, interatomic cohesions are considered "sticks". But enormous details and features of the "sticks" are usually oversimplified as indexed quantities or equivocated as geometry characteristics. These indexed quantities or geometry characteristics not only limit the explanatory capability to a few chemical/physical aspects but also eliminate generativity for expected resemblance. And these limitations can be related to the information loss during the conversion. Herein, inspired by the central dogma, a framework is introduced to compact interatomic cohesions into a detailed residue-by-residue "genome" with matched encoding/decoding tools. The framework fuses the quantum mechanical aspects, auto feature extraction, nanostructures and/or simulations, and generative models. As a proof of concept, the realization introduced in this work adopted bosonic/fermionic features, an autoencoder with image recognition processes, Density Functional Theory simulations, and a thiolate-protected gold nanocluster dataset. After repetitive modeling, validating, and analysis based on 26,528 simulated interatomic images, the interatomic cohesion can be almost losslessly encoded into an 8-value-genome, and the genome encoder-decoder pair is also obtained. The model is then automatically extended into a generative model which converts any arbitrary 8-value-genome to a bond image.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the phonon thermal conductivity of various moir\'e bilayer systems using a continuum approach and the semiclassical transport theory. When the twist angle is close to 0, we observe a significant reduction of thermal conductivity in a particular low-temperature regime. This reduction is attributed to a moir\'e-induced reconstruction of acoustic phonon bands and associated decrease of the group velocity. Conversely, in the zero temperature limit, the thermal conductivity is enhanced by moir\'e effect, surpassing the original values in non-moir\'e counterparts. These changes result in a characteristic temperature dependence which deviates from the quadratic behavior in intrinsic two-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy corner modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</description>

Abstract: The quantum conductance of flat (Euclidean) circuits subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling shows a symmetric response to the inversion of the spin-orbit field in Aharonov-Casher interference patterns. Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) circuits defined on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset. We discuss triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.</description>

      <title>Self-similar plasmonic nanolenses: mesoscopic ensemble averaging and chiral light-matter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the near-field enhancement of self-similar nanolenses, made of three plasmonic nanospheres with decreasing sizes and separations, is affected by quantum corrections in the optical response of the metal, and by fabrication imperfections related to the positioning of the spheres in the nanolens. In particular, we integrate mesoscopic phenomena, such as electron spill-in and -out and surface-enabled Landau damping, via the surface-response formalism, focusing particularly on the role of spill-out in alkali metals. In addition, we take realistic imperfections in the nanofabrication process into account, through numerical averaging of both far- and near-field spectra for large collections of nanolenses. Statistical analysis of hundreds of trimers shows that inevitable deviations from the perfectly aligned chain only slightly, if at all, impair the field enhancement, as long as the average misplacement is kept within 1 nm from the ideal situation. Wishing to explore whether such imperfections can be harvested for practical applications, we probe the potential for triggering chiral response. Our results verify that imperfect nanolenses can display considerable light-induced optical activity and circular dichroism, while providing a means to manipulate the optical chirality density. This highlights how promising the nanolensing effect is for chiral light-matter interactions. Nonetheless, we emphasize that quantification of chiral light-matter interactions can be largely affected by mesoscopic phenomena, which cannot be ignored when near-field quantities like optical chirality density are investigated.</description>

      <title>Edge states and persistent current in a PT-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with generic boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic, anti-periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point bandgap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). The Zak phase receives no contribution from the NNN interaction under the PBC. We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC. We show that the model without the NNN interaction is exactly solvable for a class of GBC of which PBC, anti-periodic boundary condition(APBC) and anti-hermitian boundary condition(AHBC) arise as special cases. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) and AHBC for vanishing NNN interaction. We show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non-vanishing NNN interaction in the parametric regions where PT-symmetry is broken under PBC. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond a critical value. The bulk-boundary correspondence(BBC) for unbroken PT-phase is similar to hermitian SSH model, while non-Hermitian skin effect(NHSE) is observed for broken PT-phase.</description>

      <title>Phase-space Generalized Brillouin Zone for spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) has been highly successful in characterizing the topology and band structure of non-Hermitian systems. However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ bifurcation.The response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile manner.Our framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Quantitative noncontact measurement of thermal Hall angle and transverse thermal conductivity by lock-in thermography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a quantitative noncontact measurement method for the thermal Hall effect (THE) based on magnetic-field-modulated lock-in thermography. This method enables visualization of THE-induced temperature change and quantitative estimation of the thermal Hall angle $\theta_{\rm THE}$ by applying periodic magnetic fields to a sample and obtaining the first harmonic response of thermal images. By combining this method with LIT-based measurement techniques for the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$, we also quantify the transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$. We validate our measurement methods by estimating $\theta_{\rm THE}$, $\kappa_{xx}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$ in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co$_2$MnGa slab showing large THE.</description>

      <title>Valley Gapless Semiconductor: Models and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Photonic heat amplifiers based on Anderson insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two Anderson insulator reservoirs connected by lossless lines, allowing them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, we maintain one reservoir at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two distinct parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the temperature modulation of the colder Anderson insulator. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic pairing in graphene quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting instabilities of twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals (TBGQC) obtained by stacking two monolayer graphene sheets with a $30^\circ$ relative twisting. The electronic energy spectrum of TBGQC contains periodic energy ranges (PER) and quasiperiodic energy ranges (QER), where the underlying local density of states (LDOS) exhibits periodic and quasiperiodic distribution, respectively. We found that superconductivity in the PER is a simple superposition of two monolayer superconductors. This is because, particularly near the charge neutrality point of TBGQC, the two layers are weekly coupled, leading to pairing instabilities with uniform distribution in real space. On the other hand, within QER, the inhomogeneous distribution of the LDOS enhances the superconducting instability with a non-uniform distribution of pairing amplitudes, leading to quasiperiodic superconductivity. Our study can qualitatively explain the superconductivity in recently discovered moir\'e quasicrystals, which show superconductivity in its QER.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find that the double-threshold voltage-current characteristics in the insulating regime in the ultra-clean two-valley two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are promoted by perpendicular magnetic fields, persisting to an order of magnitude lower voltages and considerably higher electron densities compared to the zero-field case. This observation indicates the perpendicular-magnetic-field stabilization of the quantum electron solid.</description>

      <title>Twisted Bilayer Graphene in Commensurate Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ``magic angles" in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has spurred extensive research into its electronic properties. The primary tool for studying this thus far has been the famous Bistritzer-MacDonald model (BM model), which relies on several approximations. This work aims to build the first steps in studying magic angles without using this model. Thus, we study a 2d model for TBG in both AA and AB stacking \emph{without} the approximations of the BM model in the continuum setting, using two copies of a potential with the symmetries of graphene, either sharing a common origin (in AA stacking) or with shifted origins (in AB stacking), and twisted with respect to each other. Our results hold for a wide class of potentials in both stacking types. We describe the angles for which the two twisted lattices are commensurate and prove the existence of Dirac cones in the vertices of the Brillouin zone for such angles. Furthermore, we show that for small potentials, the slope of the Dirac cones is small for commensurate angles that are close to incommensurate angles. This work is the first to establish the existence of Dirac cones for twisted bilayer graphene (for either stacking) in the continuum setting without relying on the BM model. This work is the first in a series of works to build a more fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of magic angles.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall effect in transition metals from first-principles scattering calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use first-principles scattering calculations based upon wave-function matching and implemented with a tight-binding MTO basis to evaluate the orbital Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ for Ti, V, Cr, Cu and Pt metals with temperature-induced lattice disorder. Only interatomic fluxes of orbital angular momentum are included in these estimates; intraatomic fluxes which do not contribute to the transfer of angular momentum are explicitly excluded. The resistivity and orbital Hall angle are both found to be linear in temperature so $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ is at most weakly temperature dependent. The value of $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ we obtain for bulk Cr is $ \approx 2 \times 10^3 (\hbar/e) \, (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$ which is substantially lower than previously obtained theoretical results but agrees well with experiment. In units of $10^3 (\hbar/e) (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$, the values obtained for Ti, V and Pt are $5$, $6$ and $7$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Singlet-only Always-on Gapless Exchange Qubits with Baseband Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson vortices at finite voltage bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of finite voltage bias on Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in topological Josephson junctions with a vortex lattice. The voltage drives vortices into steady motion, squeezing the CdGM spectrum due to quasi-relativistic dispersion. A finite voltage range allows well-defined states, but beyond a critical breakdown voltage, the states collapse to zero energy and become sharply localized, marking a dynamical transition. Additionally, finite bias modifies selection rules for CdGM state transitions. Notably, in the steady-state regime, the time-averaged current vanishes, revealing a novel interplay between vortex dynamics and quantum coherence.</description>
