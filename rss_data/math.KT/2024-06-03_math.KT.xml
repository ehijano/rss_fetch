      <title>Homotopy theory of pre-Calabi-Yau morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the homotopy theory of pre-Calabi-Yau morphisms, viewing them as Maurer-Cartan elements of an $L_{\infty}$-algebra. We give two different notions of homotopy: a notion of weak homotopy for morphisms between $d$-pre-Calabi-Yau categories whose underlying graded quivers on the domain (resp. codomain) are the same, and a notion of homotopy for morphisms between fixed pre-Calabi-Yau categories $(\mathcal{A},s_{d+1}M_{\mathcal{A}})$ and $(\mathcal{B},s_{d+1}M_{\mathcal{B}})$. Then, we show that the notion of homotopy is stable under composition and that homotopy equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms. Finally, we prove that the functor constructed by the author in a previous article between the category of pre-Calabi-Yau categories and the partial category of $A_{\infty}$-categories of the form $\mathcal{A}\oplus\mathcal{A}^*[d-1]$, for $\mathcal{A}$ a graded quiver, together with hat morphisms sends homotopic $d$-pre-Calabi-Yau morphisms to weak homotopic $A_{\infty}$-morphisms.</description>

      <title>$G$-tables and the Poisson structure of the even cohomology of cotangent bundle of the Heisenberg Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we define the concept of a $G$-table of a $G$-(co)algebra and we compute the $G$-table of some $G$-(co)algebras (here a $G$-algebra is an algebra on which $G$ acts, semisimply, by algebra automorphisms). The $G$-table of a $G$-(co)algebra $A$ is a set of scalars that provides very precise and concise information about both the algebra structure and the $G$-module structure of $A$. In particular, the ordinary multiplication table of $A$ can be derived from the $G$-table of $A$. From the $G$-table of a $G$-algebra $A$ we define a plain algebra $P(A)$ associated to it and we present some basic functoriality results about $P$. Obtaining the $G$-table of a given $G$-algebra $A$ requires a considerable amount of work but, the result, is a very powerful tool as shown in the second part of the paper. Here we compute the $SL(2)$-tables of the Poisson algebra structure of the even-degree part of the cohomology associated to the cotangent bundle of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie group with Lie algebra $h$, that is $H_E(h)=H_E^{\bullet}(h,\bigwedge^{\bullet}h)$. This Poisson $SL(2)$-algebra has dimension 18. From these $SL(2)$-tables we deduce that the underlying Lie algebra of $H_E(h)$ is isomorphic to $gl(3)\ltimes gl(3)_{ab}$ with the first factor acting on the second (abelian) one by the adjoint representation. We find it remarkable that the Lie algebra structure on $H_{E}(h)$ contains a semisimple Lie subalgebra (in this case $sl(3)$) strictly larger than the Levi factor of $\text{Der}(h)$, which in this case is $sl(2)\subset H^{1}(h,h)$. This means that the Levi factor of the Lie algebra $H_{E}(h)$ has nontrivial elements outside $H^{1}(h,h)$. Finally, this leads us to find a family of commutative Poisson algebras whose underlying Lie structure is $gl(n)\ltimes gl(n)_{ab}$ (arbitrary $n$) such that, for $n=3$, is isomorphic to $H_E(h)$.</description>
