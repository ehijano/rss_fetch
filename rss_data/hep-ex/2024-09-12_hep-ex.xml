      <title>Initial performance of the Radar Echo Telescope for Cosmic Rays, RET-CR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radar Echo Telescope for Cosmic Rays (RET-CR), a pathfinder instrument for the radar echo method of ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino detection, was initially deployed near Summit Station, Greenland, in May 2023. After a 4 week commissioning period, 9 days of data were taken before the instrument went offline. In this article, we describe the instrument as it was deployed, and the initial performance of the detector. We show that the technical aspects of running a radar based particle cascade detector in the ice have been demonstrated. Analysis of the 2023 data informed improvements that were incorporated into the May-August 2024 deployment, which has just concluded at time of writing. Results from the 2024 run will be presented in forthcoming publications.</description>

      <title>The precision measurement of the W boson mass and its impact on physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a mediator of the weak nuclear force, the W boson influences many properties of fundamental particles and their interactions. Understanding the W boson as accurately as possible, including knowing its mass, has been a priority in particle physics for decades. In the past few years, in a succession of increasing-precision measurements by multiple experiments, a significant tension between the measured and predicted mass has been documented by the CDF Collaboration. Furthermore, smaller differences between different measurements exist. Because the W boson mass provides a window on new physics, a comparison between different measurement techniques can inform the path to further investigations. This Perspective article overviews the role of the W boson mass in the Standard Model of Particle Physics and its extensions, compares and contrasts its measurement techniques and discusses prospects and future directions.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of analogue MAPS fabricated in 65 nm technology for the ALICE ITS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE ITS3 project foresees the use of ultra-light MAPS, developed in the 65 nm imaging process, for the vertex detector in the ALICE experiment at the LHC to drastically improve the vertexing performance. This new development, initiated by an international consortium of the ALICE ITS3 collaboration and the CERN EP R&amp;D project, enhances the overall MAPS performance. Small-scale prototypes are designed to study the analogue properties of the TPSCo 65 nm technology and compare the charge collection performance in different processes, pitches, pixel geometries, and irradiation levels. Recent results from lab and test-beam characterisation detailing the efficiency and the spatial resolution of the APTS with different pixel geometries and pitches satisfy the ALICE ITS3 requirements. A quantitative evolution of the charge collection and sharing among pixels is evident in the CE-65 with different in-pixel readouts. Attaining a spatial resolution better than 3 $\mu$m with a 10 $\mu$m pitch and over 99% efficiency in the moderate irradiation environment of ALICE also supports the viability of using 65 nm MAPS for FCC-ee vertex detectors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Direct Detection of Higgsino Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While much supersymmetric WIMP parameter space has been ruled out, one remaining important candidate is Higgsino dark matter. The Higgsino can naturally realize the ``inelastic dark matter" scenario, where the scattering off a nucleus occurs between two nearly-degenerate states, making it invisible to WIMP direct detection experiments if the splitting is too large to be excited. It was realized that a ``luminous dark matter" detection process, where the Higgsino upscatters in the Earth and subsequently decays into a photon in a large neutrino detector, offers the best sensitivity to such a scenario. We consider the possibility of adding a large volume of a heavy element, such as Pb or U, around the detector. We also consider the presence of U and Th in the Earth itself, and the effect of an enhanced high-velocity tail of the dark matter distribution due to the presence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. These effects can significantly improve the sensitivity of detectors such as JUNO, SNO+, and Borexino, potentially making it possible in the future to cover much of the remaining parameter space for this classic SUSY WIMP dark matter.</description>

      <title>Color transparency in hard $pd$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the predictions of perturbative QCD, the effect of color transparency has been the focus of attention in the community studying modifications of hadrons in nuclear medium for several decades. The search for this effect in reactions involving heavy nuclei can be complicated by uncertainties in nuclear characteristics (nucleon density distributions and wave functions), which can affect the interpretation of experiments. In this work, we consider the reaction $d(p,pp)n$ at $p_{\rm lab}=15$ GeV/c caused by hard elastic $pp$ scattering, in which these uncertainties are actually reduced to the behavior of the deuteron wave function at large momenta. It is shown that for transverse momenta of the spectator neutron $\leq 0.4$ GeV/c the choice of the deuteron wave function cannot affect the identification of the color transparency effect. A simple method for studying color transparency in $dd$ collisions is also suggested based on the identification of quasi-free $pd$ interactions.</description>

      <title>Unified study of nucleon and $\Delta$ baryon spectra and their strong decays with chiral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we systematically study both the mass spectra and strong decays of the nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances up to the $N=2$ shell within a unified quark model framework with chiral dynamics. In this framework we achieve a good description of the strong decay properties of the well-established nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances. Meanwhile, the mass reversal between $N(1440)1/2^{+}$ as the first radial excitation state and the $1P$-wave nucleon resonances can be explained. We show that the three-body spin-orbit potential arising from the one-gluon exchange can cause a large configuration mixing between $N(1520)3/2^-$ and $N(1700)3/2^-$, and is also responsible for the large splitting between $\Delta(1600)1/2^-$ and $\Delta(1700)1/2^-$. Some of these baryon resonances turn to weakly couple to the $N\pi$, $N\eta$, $K\Lambda$, and $K\Sigma$ channels, which may answer the question why they have not been established in these channels via the $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ scatterings. It shows that these ``missing resonances" may have large potentials to be established in the $N\pi\pi$ final state due to their large decay rates into either the $\Delta(1232)$ or $1P$-wave nucleon resonances via the pionic decays. Further experimental search for their signals in charmonium decays at BESIII is thus strongly recommended.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of Transverse Momentum Dependent Helicity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first global analysis of transverse momentum dependent helicity distributions of the proton. The analysis is performed at next-to-leading order with the evolution factor at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Nonzero signals are determined for up and down quarks and their $k_T$-integrated polarization are consistent with analyses in collinear factorization, while the distributions of other flavors are loosely constrained by existing data. With increasing transverse momentum, quarks at large $x$ become less polarized while those at small $x$ become more polarized.</description>

      <title>Can millicharge be probed at future Super Tau Charm Facility via mono-$\pi^0$ searches?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new channel to search for millicharged particles at the future Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) via mono-$\pi^0$ signature. For the first time, we compute the mono-$\pi^0$ signal events at the future STCF due to millicharged particle production, as well as due to standard model irreducible/reducible backgrounds. By utilizing the assumed 20 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity for each running energy with $\sqrt{s}= 2$ GeV, 4 GeV and 7 GeV, we derive the corresponding upper limits on millicharge, respectively. Via mono-$\pi^0$ searches at the future STCF with $\sqrt{s}=2$ GeV, the upper limits on millicharge can be improved than ArgoNeuT when the mass of millicharged particle is less than about 500 MeV, but are not very competitive compared to a latest derivation from a past BEBC experiment and a new SENSEI experiment. Regardless, the mono-$\pi^0$ searches could be an important complement to investigate the invisible particles, such as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Converting sWeights to Probabilities with Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning approaches continues to have many benefits in experimental nuclear and particle physics. One common issue is generating training data which is sufficiently realistic to give reliable results. Here we advocate using real experimental data as the source of training data and demonstrate how one might subtract background contributions through the use of probabilistic weights which can be readily applied to training data. The sPlot formalism is a common tool used to isolate distributions from different sources. However, negative sWeights produced by the sPlot technique can lead to issues in training and poor predictive power. This article demonstrates how density ratio estimation can be applied to convert sWeights to event probabilities, which we call drWeights. The drWeights can then be applied to produce the distributions of interest and are consistent with direct use of the sWeights. This article will also show how decision trees are particular well suited to converting sWeights, with the benefit of fast prediction rates and adaptability to aspects of the experimental data such as data sample size and proportions of different event sources. We also show that a double density ratio approach where the initial drWeights are reweighted by an additional classifier gives substantially better results.</description>

      <title>Angular analysis of $B \to K^* e^+ e^-$ in the low-$q^2$ region with new electron identification at Belle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an angular analysis of the $B\to K^* e^+ e^-$ decay for the dielectron mass squared, $q^2$, range of $0.0008$ to $1.1200 ~\text{GeV}^2 /c^4$ using the full Belle data set in the $K^{*0} \to K^+ \pi^-$ and $K^{*+} \to K_S^0 \pi^+$ channels, incorporating new methods of electron identification to improve the statistical power of the data set. This analysis is sensitive to contributions from right-handed currents from physics beyond the Standard Model by constraining the Wilson coefficients $\mathcal{C}_7^{(\prime)}$. We perform a fit to the $B\to K^* e^+ e^-$ differential decay rate and measure the imaginary component of the transversality amplitude to be $A_T^{\rm Im} = -1.27 \pm 0.52 \pm 0.12$, and the $K^*$ transverse asymmetry to be $A_T^{(2)} = 0.52 \pm 0.53 \pm 0.11$, with $F_L$ and $A_T^{\rm Re}$ fixed to the Standard Model values. The resulting constraints on the value of $\mathcal{C}_7^{\prime}$ are consistent with the Standard Model within a $2\sigma$ confidence interval.</description>

Abstract: A search for dark mesons originating from strongly-coupled, $SU(2)$ dark flavor symmetry conserving models and decaying gaugephobically to pure Standard Model final states containing top and bottom quarks is presented. The search targets fully hadronic final states and final states with exactly one electron or muon and multiple jets. The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 $fb^{-1}$ of proton$-$proton collisions collected at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess over the Standard Model background expectation is observed and the results are used to set the first direct constraints on this type of model. The two-dimensional signal space of dark pion masses $m_{\pi_D}$ and dark rho-meson masses $m_{\rho_D}$ is scanned. For $m_{\pi_D}/m_{\rho_D}=0.45$, dark pions with masses $m_{\pi_D}&lt;940$ GeV are excluded at the 95% CL, while for $m_{\pi_D}/m_{\rho_D}=0.25$ masses $m_{\pi_D}&lt;740$ GeV are excluded.</description>

      <title>SCEP: a Cosmic Magnetic Monopole Search Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic monopole is a well-motivated class of beyond-Standard-Model particles that could provide insights into the long-standing puzzle of the quantization of electric charge. These hypothetical particles are likely to be super heavy ($\sim$10$^{15}$ GeV) and be produced in the very early stages of the Universe's evolution. We propose a novel detection scenario for the search of such cosmic magnetic monopoles, utilizing a hybrid approach that combines radio-frequency atomic magnetometers and plastic scintillators. Such setup allows for the collection of both the induction and scintillation signals generated by the passage of a magnetic monopole, which provides acceptance to the magnetic monopoles with their velocities larger than about 10$^{-6}$ light speed (assuming a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$4) and their masses larger than approximately 10$^7$ GeV (at $\beta\sim10^{-3}$). The proposed detector design has the potential to scale up to large area, enabling the exploration of the parameter space of the cosmic magnetic monopole beyond the current experimental and astrophysical constraints. It is estimated that such detector can reach current most stringent limits of the flux set by previous searches, with a signal-to-noise ratio of the induction signal larger than about 4.5, assuming an effective exposure being 20000 year$\cdot$m$^2$ and coil layer of 3.</description>

      <title>First Indication of Solar $^8$B Neutrino Flux through Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T liquid xenon detector at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory is used to measure the solar $^8$B neutrino flux by detecting neutrinos through coherent scattering with xenon nuclei. Data samples requiring the coincidence of scintillation and ionization signals (paired), as well as unpaired ionization-only signals (US2), are selected with energy threshold of approximately 1.1 keV (0.33 keV) nuclear recoil energy. Combining the commissioning run and the first science run of PandaX-4T, a total exposure of 1.20 and 1.04 tonne$\cdot$year are collected for the paired and US2, respectively. After unblinding, 3 and 332 events are observed with an expectation of 2.8$\pm$0.5 and 251$\pm$32 background events, for the paired and US2 data, respectively. A combined analysis yields a best-fit $^8$B neutrino signal of 3.5 (75) events from the paired (US2) data sample, with $\sim$37\% uncertainty, and the background-only hypothesis is disfavored at 2.64$\sigma$ significance. This gives a solar $^8$B neutrino flux of ($8.4\pm3.1$)$\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, consistent with the standard solar model prediction. It is also the first indication of solar $^8$B neutrino ``fog'' in a dark matter direct detection experiment.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $e^+e^-\to K_SK_L$ cross section near the $\phi(1020)$ resonance with the SND detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross section for the $e^+e^-\to K_SK_L$ process is measured in the center-of-mass energy range from 1000 MeV to 1100 MeV in the experiment with the SND detector at the VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider. The measurement is carried out in the $K_S\to 2\pi^0$ decay mode. Data with an integrated luminosity of 20 pb$^{-1}$ recorded in 2018 at 18 energy points are used in the analysis. The systematic uncertainty in the measured cross section at the maximum of the $\phi$ resonance is 0.9%. The mass, width of the $\phi$ meson, and the product of the branching fractions $B(\phi\to K_SK_L)B(\phi\to e^+e^-)$ are determined from the fit to the cross-section energy dependence.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the forward-backward asymmetry in $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the $C$-odd radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ in a dispersive formalism, concentrating on the leading pion-pole contribution in the virtual box diagrams. In particular, we show how the effect of a general pion vector form factor in the loop integral can be incorporated in a model-independent way and how the cancellation of infrared singularities proceeds in this case. The numerical results, dominated by the infrared enhanced contributions, indicate significant corrections beyond scalar QED, essentially confirming recent findings in generalized vector-meson-dominance models.</description>

      <title>Entanglement autodistillation from particle decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle decays do not constitute a spin ``measurement'' in the quantum-mechanical sense, but still modify the spin state, in particular for an entangled system. We show that for a spin-entangled pair of particles the entanglement of the system can increase after the decay of one particle. This unique phenomenon has no equivalent for stable particles and could be observable in top pair production at a high-energy polarized $e^+ e^-$ collider.</description>

      <title>Inferring flavor mixtures in multijet events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multijet events with heavy-flavors are of central importance at the LHC since many relevant processes -- such as $t\bar t$, $hh$, $t\bar t h$ and others -- have a preferred branching ratio for this final state. Current techniques for tackling these processes use hard-assignment selections through $b$-tagging working points, and suffer from systematic uncertainties because of the difficulties in Monte Carlo simulations. We develop a flexible Bayesian mixture model approach to simultaneously infer $b$-tagging score distributions and the flavor mixture composition in the dataset. We model multidimensional jet events, and to enhance estimation efficiency, we design structured priors that leverages the continuity and unimodality of the $b$-tagging score distributions. Remarkably, our method eliminates the need for a parametric assumption and is robust against model misspecification -- It works for arbitrarily flexible continuous curves and is better if they are unimodal. We have run a toy inferential process with signal $bbbb$ and backgrounds $bbcc$ and $cccc$, and we find that with a few hundred events we can recover the true mixture fractions of the signal and backgrounds, as well as the true $b$-tagging score distribution curves, despite their arbitrariness and nonparametric shapes. We discuss prospects for taking these findings into a realistic scenario in a physics analysis. The presented results could be a starting point for a different and novel kind of analysis in multijet events, with a scope competitive with current state-of-the-art analyses. We also discuss the possibility of using these results in general cases of signals and backgrounds with approximately known continuous distributions and/or expected unimodality.</description>

      <title>Helicity-changing Decays of Cosmological Relic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the possibility that massive neutrinos are unstable due to their invisible decays $\nu^{}_i \to \nu^{}_j + \phi$, where $\nu^{}_i$ and $\nu^{}_j$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$) are any two of neutrino mass eigenstates with masses $m^{}_i &gt; m^{}_j$ and $\phi$ is a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson, and explore the implications for the detection of cosmological relic neutrinos in the present Universe. First, we carry out a complete calculation of neutrino decay rates in the general case where the individual helicities of parent and daughter neutrinos are specified. Then, the invisible decays of cosmological relic neutrinos are studied and their impact on the capture rates on the beta-decaying nuclei (e.g., $\nu^{}_e + {^3{\rm H}} \to {^3{\rm He}} + e^-$) is analyzed. The invisible decays of massive neutrinos could substantially change the capture rates in the PTOLEMY-like experiments when compared to the case of stable neutrinos. In particular, we find that the helicity-changing decays of Dirac neutrinos play an important role whereas those of Majorana neutrinos have no practical effects. However, if a substantial fraction of heavier neutrinos decay into the lightest one, the detection of relic neutrinos will require a much higher energy resolution and thus be even more challenging.</description>

      <title>Characterization of 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) have been fabricated and characterized. The devices employ a circular mesa design with low-resistivity contacts and an SiO$_2$ passivation layer. The I-V and C-V characteristics of the 4H-SiC LGADs are compared with complementary 4H-SiC PiN diodes to confirm a high breakdown voltage and low leakage current. Both LGADs and PiN diodes were irradiated with $\alpha$ particles from a $^{210}_{84}\rm{Po}$ source. The charge collected by each device was compared, and it was observed that low-gain charge carrier multiplication is achieved in the 4H-SiC LGAD.</description>
