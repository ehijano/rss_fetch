      <title>Beyond Classical Models: Statistical Physics Tools for the Analysis of Time Series in Modern Air Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the continuous endeavour of improving the efficiency and resilience of air transport, the trend of using concepts and metrics from statistical physics has recently gained momentum. This scientific discipline, which integrates elements from physics and statistics, aims at extracting knowledge about the microscale rules governing a (potentially complex) system when only its macroscale is observable. Translated to air transport, this entails extracting information about how individual operations are managed, by only studying coarse-grained information, e.g. average delays. We here review some fundamental concepts of statistical physics, and explore how these have been applied to the analysis of time series representing different aspects of the air transport system. In order to overcome the abstractness and complexity of some of these concepts, intuitive definitions and explanations are provided whenever possible. We further conclude by discussing the main obstacles towards a more widespread adoption of statistical physics in air transport, and sketch topics that we believe may be relevant in the future.</description>

      <title>Bayesian symbolic regression: Automated equation discovery from a physicists' perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression automates the process of learning closed-form mathematical models from data. Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space. Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Efficient Convolution through Sparse Matrix Encoding and Low-Depth Inner Product Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolution operations are foundational to classical image processing and modern deep learning architectures, yet their extension into the quantum domain has remained algorithmically and physically costly due to inefficient data encoding and prohibitive circuit complexity. In this work, we present a resource-efficient quantum algorithm that reformulates the convolution product as a structured matrix multiplication via a novel sparse reshaping formalism. Leveraging the observation that localized convolutions can be encoded as doubly block-Toeplitz matrix multiplications, we construct a quantum framework wherein sparse input patches are prepared using optimized key-value QRAM state encoding, while convolutional filters are represented as quantum states in superposition. The convolution outputs are computed through inner product estimation using a low-depth SWAP test circuit, which yields probabilistic amplitude information with reduced sampling overhead. Our architecture supports batched convolution across multiple filters using a generalized SWAP circuit. Compared to prior quantum convolutional approaches, our method eliminates redundant preparation costs, scales logarithmically with input size under sparsity, and enables direct integration into hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipelines. This work provides a scalable and physically realizable pathway toward quantum-enhanced feature extraction, opening up new possibilities for quantum convolutional neural networks and data-driven quantum inference.</description>

      <title>LensingFlow: An Automated Workflow for Gravitational Wave Lensing Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform via affine map: applications to high-speed nonlinear optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work present an affine map approximation for solving the inverse scattering problem related to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger model of signal propagation in high-speed coherent optical communication. Numerical simulations indicate that accurate recovery of the transmitted bit sequence can be achieved using only the continuous part of the Lax spectrum at the fiber output, thereby allowing the discrete (soliton) spectrum to be disregarded. We observed that the numerically evaluated rank of the resulting affine map matrix equals the number of bits per transmitted sequence, and we utilize this to derive a reduced order affine map.</description>

      <title>Scaling Pedestrian Crossing Analysis to 100 U.S. Cities via AI-based Segmentation of Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately measuring street dimensions is essential to evaluating how their design influences both travel behavior and safety. However, gathering street-level information at city scale with precision is difficult given the quantity and complexity of urban intersections. To address this challenge in the context of pedestrian crossings - a crucial component of walkability - we introduce a scalable and accurate method for automatically measuring crossing distance at both marked and unmarked crosswalks, applied to America's 100 largest cities. First, OpenStreetMap coordinates were used to retrieve satellite imagery of intersections throughout each city, totaling roughly three million images. Next, Meta's Segment Anything Model was trained on a manually-labelled subset of these images to differentiate drivable from non-drivable surfaces (i.e., roads vs. sidewalks). Third, all available crossing edges from OpenStreetMap were extracted. Finally, crossing edges were overlaid on the segmented intersection images, and a grow-cut algorithm was applied to connect each edge to its adjacent non-drivable surface (e.g., sidewalk, private property, etc.), thus enabling the calculation of crossing distance. This achieved 93 percent accuracy in measuring crossing distance, with a median absolute error of 2 feet 3 inches (0.69 meters), when compared to manually-verified data for an entire city. Across the 100 largest US cities, median crossing distance ranges from 32 feet to 78 feet (9.8 to 23.8m), with detectable regional patterns. Median crossing distance also displays a positive relationship with cities' year of incorporation, illustrating in a novel way how American cities increasingly emphasize wider (and more car-centric) streets.</description>

      <title>How Easy Is It to Learn Motion Models from Widefield Fluorescence Single Particle Tracks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion models (i.e., transition probability densities) are often deduced from fluorescence widefield tracking experiments by analyzing single-particle trajectories post-processed from data. This analysis immediately raises the question: To what degree is our ability to learn motion models impacted by analyzing post-processed trajectories versus raw measurements? To answer this question, we mathematically formulate a data likelihood for diffraction-limited fluorescence widefield tracking experiments. In particular, we make the likelihood's dependence on the motion model versus the emission (or measurement) model explicit. The emission model describes how photons emitted by biomolecules are distributed in space according to the optical point spread function, with intensities subsequently integrated over a pixel, and convoluted with camera noise. Logic dictates that if the likelihood is primarily informed by the motion model, it should be straightforward to learn the motion model from the post-processed trajectory. Contrarily, if the majority of the likelihood is dominated by the emission model, the post-processed trajectory inferred from data is primarily informed by the emission model, and very little information on the motion model permeates into the post-processed trajectories analyzed downstream to learn motion models. Indeed, we find that for typical diffraction-limited fluorescence experiments, the emission model often robustly contributes approximately 99% to the likelihood, leaving motion models to explain a meager 1% of the data. This result immediately casts doubt on our ability to reliably learn motion models from post-processed data, raising further questions on the significance of motion models learned thus far from post-processed single-particle trajectories from single-molecule widefield fluorescence tracking experiments.</description>
