      <title>Behaviorally Correct Learning from Informants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inductive inference, we investigate the learnability of classes of formal languages. We are interested in what classes of languages are learnable in certain learning settings. A class of languages is learnable, if there is a learner that can identify all of its languages and satisfies the constraints of the learning setting. To identify a language, a learner is presented with information about this very language. When learning from informants, this information consists of examples for numbers that are, and numbers that are not included in the target language. As more and more examples are presented, the learner outputs a hypothesis sequence. To satisfy behaviorally correct identification, this hypothesis sequence must eventually only list correct labels for the target language. In this thesis, we compare the effects of a number of semantic learning restrictions on the learning capabilities for behaviorally correct learning from informants.</description>

      <title>Conservative Perception Models for Probabilistic Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying the behaviors of autonomous systems with learned perception components is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the perception and the uncertainty of operating environments. Probabilistic model checking is a powerful tool for providing guarantees on stochastic models of systems. However, constructing model-checkable models of black-box perception components for system-level mathematical guarantees has been an enduring challenge. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing provably conservative Interval Markov Decision Process (IMDP) models of closed-loop systems with perception components. We prove that our technique results in conservative abstractions with high probability. We evaluate our approach in an automatic braking case study using both a synthetic perception component and the object detector YOLO11 in the CARLA driving simulator.</description>

      <title>Polyregular Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reduce the model checking problem for a subset of Python to the satisfiability of a first-order formula over finite words, which is known to be decidable. The reduction is based on the theory of polyregular functions, a recently developed generalization of regular languages to polynomial output string-to-string functions. We implemented this reduction in a verification tool called PolyCheck, that can use both automata-based solvers and classical SMT solvers as backends.</description>

      <title>$k$-Universality of Regular Languages Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subsequence of a word $w$ is a word $u$ such that $u = w[i_1] w[i_2] \cdots w[i_k]$, for some set of indices $1 \leq i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \dots &lt; i_k \leq \vert w \vert$. A word $w$ is \emph{$k$-subsequence universal} over an alphabet $\Sigma$ if every word over $\Sigma$ up to length $k$ appears in $w$ as a subsequence. In this paper, we revisit the problem $k$-ESU of deciding, for a given integer $k$, whether a regular language, given either as nondeterministic finite automaton or as a regular expression, contains a $k$-universal word. [Adamson et al., ISAAC 2023] showed that this problem is NP-hard, even in the case when $k=1$, and an FPT algorithm w.r.t. the size of the input alphabet was given. In this paper, we improve the aforementioned algorithmic result and complete the analysis of this problem w.r.t. other parameters. That is, we propose a more efficient FPT algorithm for $k$-ESU, with respect to the size of the input alphabet, and propose new FPT algorithms for this problem w.r.t.~the number of states of the input automaton and the length of the input regular expression. We also discuss corresponding lower bounds. Our results significantly improve the understanding of this problem.</description>

      <title>Connections between the minimal neighborhood and the activity value of cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ and a finite set $A$, a cellular automaton is a transformation of the configuration space $A^G$ defined via a finite neighborhood and a local map. Although neighborhoods are not unique, every CA admits a unique minimal neighborhood, which consists on all the essential cells in $G$ that affect the behavior of the local map. An active transition of a cellular automaton is a pattern that produces a change on the current state of a cell when the local map is applied. In this paper, we study the links between the minimal neighborhood and the number of active transitions, known as the activity value, of cellular automata. Our main results state that the activity value usually imposes several restrictions on the size of the minimal neighborhood of local maps.</description>

      <title>Escape of mass of the Thue-Morse sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every Laurent series in $\mathbb{F}_q\left(\left(t^{-1}\right)\right)$ has a continued fraction expansion whose partial quotients are polynomials. De Mathan and Teuli\'e proved that the degrees of the partial quotients of the left-shifts of every quadratic Laurent series are unbounded. Shapira and Paulin and Kemarsky improved this by showing that certain sequences of probability measures on the space of lattices in the plane $\mathbb{F}_q\left(\left(t^{-1}\right)\right)^2$ exhibit positive escape of mass and conjectured that this escape is full -- that is, that these probability measures converge to zero. We disprove this conjecture by analysing in detail the case of the Laurent series over $\mathbb{F}_2$ whose sequence of coefficients is the Thue-Morse sequence. The proof relies on the discovery of explicit symmetries in its number wall.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Word Equations over Partially Commutative Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.02966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M(A,I)$ be a free partially commutative monoid with involution and $G(A,I)$ be its quotient group, e.g. a right-angled Artin or Coxeter group. Given a system of word equations over $M(A,I)$ with recognizable constraints with input size $n$ we show the structural result about the solution set of the system: the set of all solutions in $M(A,I)$ or in the group $G(A,I)$ is an EDT0L language. That is, it is given by an NFA $\mathcal{A}$ recognizing endomorphisms over some extended monoid. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}$ is effectively constructible by an NSPACE(n log n)-transducer. This implies that Satisfiability: `Is the system is solvable?' and Finiteness: `Are there infinitely many solutions?' can be decided in NSPACE(n log n). In the uniform version, these problems are PSPACE-complete, but for a suitable subclass of constraints we have more precise complexities and we conjecture that the decision problems above are NP-complete in this setting. Our results apply also to word equation over free monoids in the classical case where the involution is reading words right-to-left. This allows to specify that solutions are restricted to be palindromes.</description>

      <title>On Decidability and Expressive Power of Fusion Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algorithmic complexity and expressive power of fusion grammars, a novel formalism introduced in [Kreowski, Kuske, and Lye 2017], which extends hyperedge replacement grammars. In the first part of the work, we prove that the non-emptiness problem for fusion grammars and the membership problem for fusion grammars without markers and connectors are decidable and are in NEXPTIME. We introduce fusion grammars with bounded usage of markers and connectors and prove decidability of the membership problem for them as well. In the proofs, we develop the technique of hypergraph vertex colourings encoded in hyperedge labels and also the technique of evidence paths and their encodings.
  In the second part of the work, we study the class of languages generated by connection-preserving fusion grammars. Namely, we prove Parikh's theorem for them, i.e. we show that these languages are semilinear.</description>

      <title>Relating Reversible Petri Nets and Reversible Event Structures, categorically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal nets (CNs) are Petri nets where causal dependencies are modelled via inhibitor arcs. They play the role of occurrence nets when representing the behaviour of a concurrent and distributed system, even when reversibility is considered. In this paper we extend CNs to account also for asymmetric conflicts and study (i) how this kind of nets, and their reversible versions, can be turned into a category; and (ii) their relation with the categories of reversible asymmetric event structures.</description>
