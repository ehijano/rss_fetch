      <title>A model of thermophoresis of colloidal proteins in water using non-Fickian diffusion currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1928, Chapman generalised Einstein's theory of diffusion for non-uniform fluids to show the presence of a non-Fickian diffusion current, which he considered important in thermodiffusion (Ludwig-Soret effect). In 1941, Kiyosi It\^o proposed the formal methods of stochastic calculus in the presence of spatially dependent diffusion, yielding the same non-Fickian diffusion current as shown by Chapman. The phenomenon of thermodiffusion and thermophoresis happens in the presence of a temperature gradient, which makes diffusion space-dependent. The role of solvation forces in thermophoresis will only be clearer once that of diffusion is understood properly. In this paper, we investigate the importance of Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current on the thermophoretic motion of colloidal particles in water (with weak salt concentration). We show that all the general features of variations of the Soret coefficient $S_T$ with temperature can be captured using Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current. We compare our theoretical results with experimental plots of the Soret coefficients for three polypeptides in aqueous solution: Lysozyme, BLGA, and Poly-L-Lysine, and find a strong match. We emphasise that, in addition to the yet-to-be-understood details of solvation forces, Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current is an indispensable element that needs to be taken into account for a complete understanding of thermophoresis and thermodiffusion.</description>

      <title>Strain-rate, temperature and size effects on the mechanical behavior of fiber bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical characteristics of fibers (of various materials), as well as of fiber bundles, are of primary importance for the design and the mechanical behavior of textiles, or of fibrous and composite materials. These characteristics are classically determined from strain-rate controlled tensile testing, generally assuming a negligible role of thermal activation on damage and fracturing processes. Under this assumption, the distribution of individual fiber strengths can be deduced from a downscaling of the macroscopic mechanical behavior at the bundle scale. There are however many experimental evidences of strain-rate and temperature effects on the mechanical behavior of individual fibers or bundles, which can also creep under constant applied load. This indicates a strong role of thermal activation on these processes. Here, these effects are analyzed from a fiber-bundle model with equal-load-sharing, in which thermal activation of fiber breakings is introduced from a kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm adapted for time-varying stresses. This allows to rationalize these rate or temperature effects, such as a decrease of bundle strength, strain at peak stress, and apparent Young's modulus with decreasing strain-rate and/or increasing temperature. This also shows that the classical downscaling procedure used to estimate the distribution of individual fiber strengths from the mechanical behavior at the bundle scale should be considered with caution. If mechanical testing of the bundle is performed under conditions favoring the role of thermal activation (e.g. low applied strain-rate), this procedure can strongly underestimate the intrinsic (athermal) Weibull's parameters of the fiber strengths distribution. The same model is used as well to explore size (number of fibers) effects on bundle mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Shape, confinement and inertia effects on the dynamics of a driven spheroid in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of anisotropic particles in viscous flows underpin a wide range of processes in soft matter, microfluidics, and targeted drug delivery. Here, we investigate the motion of externally driven prolate and oblate spheroids suspended in a Newtonian fluid and confined within a square microchannel. Using lattice Boltzmann simulations, complemented by far-field hydrodynamic theory based on superposition of wall interactions, we systematically quantify how particle aspect ratio, strength of confinement, and fluid inertia influence the dynamics of a spheroid. For unconfined spheroids, we show that the translational velocity is maximized not for a sphere but for a prolate (end-on) or oblate (broadside-on) spheroid of a specific aspect ratio. Under confinement, the optimal aspect ratio shifts toward oblate shapes due to the dominant contribution of wall-induced frictional resistance. Off-center positioning introduces strong translation-rotation coupling, giving rise to two families of oscillatory trajectories - glancing and reversing - whose existence and structure are captured as closed orbits in phase space. Weak fluid inertia breaks these closed loops: glancing trajectories spiral outward and merge with reversing trajectories, and new stable fixed points emerge. Together, these results reveal how modest deviations from sphericity or creeping-flow conditions profoundly alter the dynamics of driven particles in confined geometries. The predictions offer guidelines for optimizing particle shape in microfluidic transport and highlight the rich nonlinear behavior accessible in confined suspensions of nonspherical colloids.</description>

      <title>StrAPS: Structural Angular Power Spectrum for Discovering Novel Morphologies in Block Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphologies of phase separating systems have formal distinctions such as symmetry groups, but the analysis protocol for labeling a particular phase field with a morphology requires manual expertise, arbitrary thresholds, or established signatures. In this work, it is investigated if the angular power spectrum of the 3D structure factor can discriminate between morphologies. The 3D structure factor is computed on configurations of phase separating block copolymers generated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The shell of structure factor values containing the primary peaks is isolated. This 2D field on a sphere is decomposed into spherical harmonic modes of even polynomial degree $\ell\le 12$, then further reduced to the rotationally invariant angular power spectrum. It is found that these few coefficients for low $\ell$ discriminate robustly between different morphologies. This analysis serves as an automatic tool for flagging novel structures, without a need to enumerate the plausible morphologies in advance.</description>

      <title>Velocity Weakening in Anisotropic Friction on a Tilted Titania Nanorod Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate velocity-dependent directional friction on a surface structured with tilted (~57{\deg}) titania nanorods using standard and colloidal probe force microscopy. Friction is measured at four different sliding speeds in two configurations, along and opposite to the tilt and perpendicular to the tilt direction, exhibiting anisotropic friction. Furthermore, friction decreases logarithmically with increasing sliding speed, which is attributed to the viscoelastic bending of the nanorods caused by stress-induced defect migration. The velocity weakening is more pronounced in the direction perpendicular to the tilt than along and opposite to it. The experimental findings are corroborated by creep measurements, which are well-reproduced by the Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model of viscoelasticity. Our results may be applied to the development of direction- and velocity-dependent sensors for microscale sliding motion as a robust alternative to structured interfaces based on polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Nonlocal Theory of Thixotropic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense amorphous materials exhibit both nonlocal flow cooperativity and pronounced history dependence, yet existing continuum models capture only one of these features at a time. Nonlocal rheologies are intrinsically memoryless, while thixotropic models remain local. Here we introduce a coupling between structural memory and nonlocal fluidity to include aging and rejuvenation in nonlocal granular fluidity. The resulting model reproduces hysteresis in shear-rate sweeps and delayed yielding in creep, while preserving nonlocal flow profiles. By introducing memory augmented non local granular fluidity, MNGF, we show that nonlocality alone cannot encode history, and memory alone cannot encode spatial cooperativity, but their coupling is essential and minimal. These results demonstrate that memory and nonlocality must be treated jointly to describe history dependent flows, and provide a unified framework for modeling time-dependent rheology in dense amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measurements of the lift force acting on a sphere sliding along a liquid-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the lift force experienced by a particle moving in a viscous fluid near a liquid-liquid interface. The lift force is induced by the interaction between the viscous flow generated by the particle's motion and the deformation of the soft interface. The factors influencing the lift force including the velocity, the viscosity, and the sphere radius, and the separation distance were systematically studied. The experiments demonstrate that the lift force intensifies as the particle approaches the interface, and saturates at shorter distances. These findings are consistent with predictions made using soft lubrication theory and numerical calculations, providing strong validation for the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Non-exponential relaxation without dynamic heterogeneity in van der Waals liquids above the melting point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dynamic heterogeneity on the spectral shape of structural relaxation in van der Waals liquids above the melting point by means of depolarized dynamic light scattering. To this end, we study optically anisotropic probe molecules both in the bulk and when diluted in an optically isotropic solvent. Strikingly, the relaxation shape of the probe molecules in dilution is indistinguishable from that of the pure liquid composed of the probe molecules. By contrast, when explicit dynamic heterogeneity is introduced, e.g., through internal degrees of freedom or a distribution of probe molecule sizes, the relaxation shape becomes sensitive to the solvent concentration. These findings indicate that dynamic heterogeneity has a negligible influence on the rotational dynamics of single component van der Waals liquids above the melting point, despite the pronounced non-exponential character of their relaxation shape.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-integrated Multiscale Simulation Framework: Bridging Scales in Associative Polymer-Colloid Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the rheological behavior of associative polymers bridging colloidal particles into transient networks is fundamentally challenging because the coupled spatiotemporal scales prevent efficient molecular-fidelity modeling. We address this through a novel, unified multiscale simulation framework for telechelic polymer-colloid suspensions integrating: explicit-chain Brownian dynamics resolving polymer-particle association kinetics; active learning metamodels compressing kinetics into efficient surrogates; and Population Balance-Brownian Dynamics (Pop-BD) computing network-scale dynamics from metamodel predictions. Validated against explicit-chain Brownian dynamics, our framework accurately reproduces time-and frequency-dependent stress relaxation moduli, enabling simulations of larger systems over longer timescales. Systematic investigations reveal that network connectivity exhibits critical transitions at specific chain-to-particle ratios, with bond density and lifetime correlating to enhanced relaxation times and moduli. Higher particle volume fractions yield more persistent bonds and slower relaxation. This framework connects chain-level dynamics to macroscopic rheology, enabling computationally efficient rational design of associative colloidal materials for waterborne coatings and soft-matter applications.</description>

      <title>Phason-Driven Diversity of Nucleation Pathways in Icosahedral Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleation of quasicrystals remains a fundamental puzzle, primarily due to the absence of a periodic translational template. Here, we demonstrate that phasons - hidden degrees of freedom unique to quasiperiodic order - drive diverse nucleation pathways in icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs). Combining a Landau free-energy model with the spring pair method, we compute distinct critical nuclei and their corresponding minimum energy paths. At low temperatures, a direct, symmetry-preserving pathway dominates. In contrast, higher temperatures promote a "symmetry detour" that reduces the nucleation barrier via a lower-symmetry critical nucleus. Remarkably, while the resulting bulk IQCs exhibit distinct real-space symmetries, they remain thermodynamically degenerate with identical diffraction patterns. We resolve this paradox within the high-dimensional projection framework, showing that phason shifts modulate real-space symmetry without altering bulk thermodynamics. Our findings establish phasons as the structural origin of pathway diversity, offering a new physical picture for the emergence of quasiperiodic order.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully coupled theoretical description of dislocation dynamics on deformable crystalline surfaces, using continuum modeling and the amplitude-phase-field crystal (APFC) framework extended to curved geometries. We derive a general kinematic expression for dislocation velocity directly from the complex-amplitude evolution equations, which is also applicable to deformed surfaces through curvature-modified differential operators. From numerical simulations, we show that even small out-of-plane deformations reshape the phenomenology of defect motion through curvature-induced self-propulsion, modified glide directions, and non-classical defect-defect interactions. Our results show how surface geometry profoundly influences defect dynamics and establish the surface-APFC model as a powerful framework for predicting and interpreting curvature-defect coupling across a wide range of systems, from stiff but deformable layers to soft matter surfaces and membranes that retain crystalline order.</description>

      <title>Polymer Brushes and Grafted Polymers: AI/ML-Driven Synthesis, Simulation, and Characterization towards autonomous SDL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer brushes and grafted polymers have attracted significant interest at the intersection of polymers, interfacial chemistry, colloidal science, and nanostructuring. The confinement of high-density grafted polymers and differences in swelling regimes govern the synthetic challenges and the interesting physics underlying their macromolecular dynamics. In this article, we focus on another intersection, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), and how workflows will enhance the microstructure and composition of these systems. It will also accelerate potential applications through high-throughput experimentation (HTE) and data-driven intelligence, enabling scientific discovery and optimization. Applications in microfluidics, sensors, bioimplants, drug delivery, and related areas may yet offer more opportunities for ML-driven optimization. There is also interest in applying these studies with self-driving laboratories (SDLs) that can leverage autonomous systems for synthesis screening, characterization, and application evaluation.</description>

      <title>Programming active-molecule dynamics via intramolecular nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a self-propelled particle are typically hard-wired by its microscopic construction, limiting the range of behaviors accessible without redesigning the particle itself. Here we show that intramolecular nonreciprocity provides a minimal and versatile mechanism to overcome this constraint. We construct active molecules from short chains of two species of self-propelled particles whose propulsion directions are coupled nonreciprocally according to a prescribed internal sequence. At the single-molecule level, homogeneous sequences exhibit standard persistent random-walk dynamics, whereas heterogeneous sequences produce distinct trajectories inaccessible to either constituent species alone. At the collective level, using motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) as a representative example, we find that modifying the internal sequence shifts the MIPS onset by multiple orders of magnitude in propulsion strength, without altering particle-level interactions. These results demonstrate that intramolecular nonreciprocity among a small set of active components enables sequence-level programmability from single-molecule dynamics to emergent collective behavior, providing a minimal mechanism to encode and control active-matter dynamics across scales.</description>

      <title>Self-Viscophoresis: Autonomous Motion by Biasing Thermal Fluctuations via Self-Generated Viscosity Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscale transport often relies on ubiquitous yet intrinsically random thermal fluctuations. Understanding how such fluctuations can be biased into directed motion has long been a central theme of nonequilibrium physics. Here, we introduce self-viscophoresis, a mechanism of autonomous motion based on the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a self-generated nonequilibrium viscosity field. Asymmetric colloidal particles dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer solution induce local heating under uniform illumination, producing a spatially asymmetric viscosity profile around the particle and resulting in persistent directed motion. To elucidate the physical origin of this behavior, we develop a minimal Langevin model coupling isotropic thermal fluctuations to a dynamically updating temperature-viscosity field. The model shows that viscosity asymmetry anisotropically damps stochastic dynamics, effectively biasing thermal fluctuations into a net drift. It thus reproduces the observed directed motion without invoking deterministic propulsion terms associated with effective potentials or environmental fluid flows. Our results distinguish self-viscophoresis from conventional self-propulsion mechanisms and establish it as a general framework enabling reversible control of both the direction and dimensionality of motion.</description>

      <title>Stick-slip dynamics in an interleaved system with self-amplified friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how stick-slip dynamics manifests in diverse physical conditions is a crucial topic in tribology. Although it has been extensively studied in simple frictional configurations, the characterization of stick-slip behavior in complex assemblies is challenging. This work presents the first systematic investigation of stick-slip dynamics in a system with multiple contact surfaces undergoing friction amplification through conversion of traction forces into normal compression. Using interleaved paper blocks as a model system, we combine force measurements and image processing to characterize stick-slip events occurring when the two blocks are pulled apart at different detachment velocities. We find that both the peak force and the amplitude of the stick-slip events decrease along with the system's detachment. By combining a previously designed model for friction amplification and the stick-slip dynamics predicted by a simple frictional spring-block system, we link the observed behavior to the evolving normal compression within the assembly. Through force measurements and imaging, we extract the effective stiffness of the system from stick-slip events at low velocities and relate it to the system's normal compression. We then predict the observed decrease of the global stiffness as function of the detachment by considering the spatial distribution of normal forces within the assembly, which determines an effective number of sheets contributing to the system's mechanical response. Our findings reveal a non-trivial interplay between internal stress distribution and mechanical response mediated by frictional forces, with implications for granular materials, textiles, fibrous systems, and mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Geometry Challenges Entropy: Regime-DependentRectification in Nanofluidic Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can geometry alone reshape equilibrium? Cascaded nanofluidic chambers show complex accumulation patterns, traditionally attributed to geometric diode effects. We use 3D molecular dynamics to decouple funnel rectification from boundary reflection. Simulations with argon parameters (r = 0.19 nm) reveal a striking "reverse" rectification in a 2-chamber setup: the narrow side accumulates over 5x more particles (N_1/N_0 = 5.37 +/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.0001). In a 10-chamber argon cascade, this effect drives massive downstream accumulation. A symmetric control (w_L = w_R) eliminates the gradient, confirming that funnel asymmetry - not boundary/edge effects - is the primary driver in the ballistic regime. By contrast, the super-atom regime is dominated by boundary reflection. Our results challenge standard entropic transport theory and provide design rules for passive, geometry-driven density gradients - no pump, no drive.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Boundary Following and Corner Trapping of Undulating Worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in circular and polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and then become dynamically trapped at the concave corners over prolonged periods. We model the worm as a self-propelled rod and derive analytical expressions for the evolution of its orientation when it encounters the flat and the circular boundaries of the chamber. By further incorporating translational and rotational diffusion, arising due to the undulatory and peristaltic body strokes, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that the self-propelled rod model can capture both the boundary aligning and the corner trapping behavior of the worm. The P\'eclet number $Pe$, representing the ratio of forward propulsion to rotational diffusion, is found to characterize the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time distribution of the worm. Simulations show that the angle of the worm's body with the boundary while entering a concave corner plays a key role in determining the trapping time, with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion combined with limited angular diffusion can lead to spatial localization that mimics shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms, even in the absence of thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior.</description>

      <title>Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal activity can fundamentally reshape the mechanical behavior of solids, yet its role in softening and failure remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids via non-affine fluctuations that quantify local rearrangements relative to global strain. Using scaling analysis and numerical simulations, we show that non-affinity in crystalline solids grows quadratically with active speed, increases linearly with persistence time before saturating, and scales inversely with the distance to the melting density. Spatial correlations reveal an activity-dependent growing correlation length, while relaxation dynamics are governed by the active persistence time. With increasing activity, the distributions of local non-affinity broaden, become more skewed, and develop heavy tails, eventually forming a secondary maximum that signals coexisting small and large non-affinities; this heterogeneity precedes defect formation and two-step melting from solid to hexatic and ultimately to fluid. Finally, we demonstrate that spatially patterned activation provides a simple route to locally induce non-affinity and mechanical softening. Our predictions are experimentally testable and suggest a pathway to tunable mechanics in adaptive metamaterials, with implications for mechanical regulation in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- and consequent motion -- in active nematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</description>

      <title>PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While high-fidelity Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is the standard for analyzing stress distributions and material deformation, it is computationally intensive and often ill-suited for the rapid exploration of vast kinematic configuration spaces. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, a lightweight, open-source Python framework for the efficient deployment simulation of kirigami structures. Unlike continuum mechanics solvers, PyKirigami models tessellations as articulated rigid-body networks, allowing for the real-time simulation of global deployment trajectories and volumetric transformations. The tool incorporates collision detection and interactive actuation, enabling users to validate folding paths and identify geometric locking states in both 2D and 3D topologies. This framework serves as a fast kinematic prototyping tool for kirigami structures, allowing researchers to verify deployment mechanics and self-contacts prior to performing detailed mechanical analysis or physical fabrication.</description>

      <title>Supercoiling DNA with a free end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we combine coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations and mean-field theory to study supercoiling dynamics, as well as the steady-state profiles of twist and writhe, in an open DNA polymer where one of the free ends is subjected to a constant torque. Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Oxidative Aging and Stabilization in Polymer Melts with Primary Antioxidants: Effects of Antioxidant Concentration and Molecular Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial polymeric materials often rely on antioxidants to achieve long-term reliability. Previous studies have frequently discussed the stabilization effect in the presence of macroscopic additive migration. However, the micro- to meso-scale coupling between polymer dynamics and antioxidant molecular dynamics remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we extend a polymer dynamics simulation framework that can account for oxidative aging. We also update the model so that it can explicitly incorporate antioxidant molecules into the simulation. As a result, the framework enables us to quantify how molecular architecture of antioxidants affects oxidation kinetics, which has previously been inferred only indirectly from apparent changes in reaction rates. It also allows us to evaluate the effects of antioxidant concentration and molecular architecture on the spatial heterogeneity of oxidative aging.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>

Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <title>Delay-facilitated self-assembly in compartmentalized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-assembly processes in biological and synthetic biomolecular systems are often governed by the spatial separation of biochemical processes. While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental reactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.

      <title>How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description>
