      <title>Threshold Resource Redistribution in Spatially-Structured Kinship Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for a threshold-based resource redistribution process in a spatially-explicit population, characterizing the relation between kinship network structure, local interactions and persistence. We find that population survival becomes possible for lower resource densities, but leads to increased network heterogeneity and locally centralized clusters. We interpret this in relation to a feedback between the kinship network structure and reproduction ability. Agents receive stochastic resources and solicit additional resources from connected individuals when below a minimum, with each agent contributing a fraction of their excess based on relatedness. We first analyze a fully-connected population with uniform redistribution fraction and discuss mean field expectations as well as finite size corrections. We extend this model to a hub-and-spoke network, exploring the impact of network asymmetry or centrality on resource distribution. We then develop a spatially-limited population model with diffusion, local pairing, reproduction and mortality. Redistribution is introduced as a function of relatedness (generational distance through most-recent common ancestor) and distance. Redistribution-dependent populations exhibit a higher level of relational closeness with increased clustering for agents of highest node strength. These results highlight the interaction of resource density, cooperation and kinship in a spatially-limited regime.</description>

      <title>Multiple timescales in collective motion: daily and intraday upstream fish migration focusing on Feller condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fish migration is a collective phenomenon that has multiple timescales, ranging from daily to intraday (hourly or even finer). We propose a unified mathematical approach using diffusion bridges, nonlinear stochastic differential equations with pinned initial and terminal conditions, to model both daily and intraday fish migration phenomena. Drift and diffusion coefficients of these bridges are determined based on time-dependent parameterized average and variance curves fitted against fish count data, with which the unique existence of their solutions is rigorously guaranteed. We show that sample paths of the diffusion bridges have qualitatively distinctive properties depending on the Feller condition, namely, the ratio between the sizes of diffusion and drift. Our application study about the juvenile upstream migration of Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis (Ayu) in Japan clarifies similarities and differences between daily and intraday migration phenomena. Particularly, we discuss that the daily and intraday fish count data correspond to distinctive Feller indices, showing that the former is qualitatively less randomized and intermittent. The results obtained in this study suggest that the Feller condition potentially serves as an effective tool for evaluating fish migration phenomena of Ayu across different timescales.</description>

      <title>Habitat heterogeneity and dispersal network structure as drivers of metacommunity dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial structure and species interactions jointly shape the dynamics and biodiversity of ecological systems, yet most theoretical models either neglect spatial heterogeneity or sacrifice analytical tractability. Here, we provide a unified microscopic, mechanistic framework for deriving effective metapopulation and metacommunity models from individual-based ecological dynamics on arbitrary dispersal networks. The resulting coarse-grained description features an effective dispersal kernel that encodes both microscopic dynamical parameters and network topology. Based on this framework, we demonstrate exact analytical results for species persistence in both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes, including a generalization of the classical concept of metapopulation capacity to non-uniform local extinction rates. Incorporating stochasticity arising from finite carrying capacities, we obtain a reduced one-dimensional description that reveals universal finite-size scaling laws for extinction times and fluctuations. Extending the approach to multiple competing species, we prove that in homogeneous environments monodominance can be avoided only in a fine-tuned, marginally stable coexistence state, and that the classic metapopulation capacity gives only a necessary but not sufficient condition for persistence. We demonstrate that heterogeneous habitats can support stable coexistence, but only above a critical level of heterogeneity. Finally, we outline how additional ecological processes can be systematically incorporated within the same formalism. Together, these results provide analytical benchmarks and a general route for constructing spatially explicit ecological theories based on an interpretable underlying mechanistic foundation.</description>

      <title>To clean or not to clean: The free-rider problem in sequentially shared resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared resources enhance productivity yet at the same time provide channels for biological and digital contamination, turning physical or digital hygiene into a cooperation dilemma prone to free-riding. Here we introduce a game of sequential sharing of common resources, an empirically parameterized evolutionary model of population dynamics in sequential-use settings such as gyms and shared workspaces. The success of the strategies implemented in the model, such as cleaning equipment before or after use, are based on the trade-offs between cleaning costs, contamination risk, and social incentives to mitigate disease transmission. We find that cooperative hygiene can be achieved by lowering the effective costs of cleaning, strengthening pro-social incentives, and monitoring population-level noncompliance. Remarkably, stability of fully altruistic populations is primarily affected by the cleaning costs. In contrast, increasing effective infection costs, for example through punishment, appears less important in this case. The model's evolutionary dynamics exhibit multi-stability, hysteresis, and abrupt shifts in strategy composition, broadly consistent with empirical observations from shared-use facilities. Our framework offers testable predictions and is amenable to quantitative calibration with behavioral and environmental data. Our predictions can be used to inform the design of cost-effective public health and digital security policies.</description>

      <title>Growth Models Under Uniform Catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic growth models for populations organized in colonies and subject to uniform catastrophes. To assess population viability, we analyze scenarios in which individuals adopt dispersion strategies after catastrophic events. For these models, we derive explicit expressions for the survival probability and the mean time to extinction, both with and without spatial constraints. In addition, we complement this analysis by comparing uniform catastrophes with binomial and geometric catastrophes in models with dispersion and no spatial restrictions. Here, the terms uniform, binomial and geometric refer to the probability distributions governing the number of individuals that survive immediately after a catastrophe. This comparison allows us to quantify the impact of different types of catastrophic events on population persistence.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>
