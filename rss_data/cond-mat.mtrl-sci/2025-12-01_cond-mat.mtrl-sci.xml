      <title>IRSSG: An Open-Source Software Package for Spin Space Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source software package IRSSG for investigating magnetic systems with spin space groups (SSGs). The package works within the density functional theory (DFT) framework and requires wavefunctions from DFT codes, such as VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, as well as any other code that has an interface to Wannier90. We introduce a set of compact SSG international symbols by combining non-crystallographic point groups with the 230 crystallographic space groups. The program first identifies all SSG operations and determines the SSG international symbol for a given magnetic system. It then generates the SSG character tables of little groups at any $k$ point. Finally, it computes the traces of matrix presentations of SSG operations and assigns irreducible corepresentation labels to magnetic energy bands. The program is not only timely but also essential for advancing research on the study of magnons, altermagnetism, magnetic topology, and novel high-degeneracy excitations in SSG systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magneto-Mechanical Synergism in the Process-Structure Correlation in Fe-C Alloys: A Phase-Field Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applied magnetic fields can alter phase equilibria and kinetics in steels; however, quantitatively resolving how magnetic, chemical, and elastic driving forces jointly influence the microstructure remains challenging. We develop a quantitative magneto-mechanically coupled phase-field model for the Fe-C system that couples a CALPHAD-based chemical free energy with demagnetization-field magnetostatics and microelasticity. The model reproduces single- and multi-particle evolution during the alpha to gamma inverse transformation at 1023 K under external fields up to 20 T, including ellipsoidal morphologies observed experimentally at 8 T. Chemically driven growth is isotropic; a magnetic interaction introduces an anisotropic driving force that elongates gamma precipitates along the field into ellipsoids, while elastic coherency promotes faceting, yielding elongated cuboidal or ``brick-like" particles under combined magneto-elastic coupling. Growth kinetics increase with C content, and decrease with field strength and misfit strain. Multi-particle simulations reveal dipolar interaction-mediated coalescence for field-parallel neighbors and ripening for field-perpendicular neighbors. Incorporating field-dependent diffusivity from experiment slows kinetics as expected; a first-principles-motivated anisotropic diffusivity correction is estimated to be small (&lt;2%). These results establish a process-structure link for magnetically assisted heat treatments of Fe-C alloys and provide guidance for microstructure control via chemo-magneto-mechanical synergism.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Magnon-magnon coupling in hybrid magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal coupling of magnetic excitations (magnons) with themselves has created a new research sub-field in hybrid magnonics, i.e., magnon-magnon coupling, which focuses on materials discovery and engineering for probing and controlling magnons in a coherent manner. This is enabled by, one, the abundant mechanisms of introducing magnetic interactions, with examples of exchange coupling, dipolar coupling, RKKY coupling, and DMI coupling, and two, the vast knowledge of how to control magnon band structure, including field and wavelength dependences of frequencies, for determining the degeneracy of magnon modes with different symmetries. In particular, we discuss how magnon-magnon coupling is implemented in various materials systems, with examples of magnetic bilayers, synthetic antiferromagnets, nanomagnetic arrays, layered van der Waals magnets, and (DMI SOT materials) in magnetic multilayers. We then introduce new concept of applications for these hybrid magnonic materials systems, with examples of frequency up/down conversion and magnon-exciton coupling, and discuss what properties are desired for achieving those applications.</description>

      <title>EPW-VASP interface for first-principles calculations of electron-phonon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interface between the Vienna \textit{Ab initio} Simulation Package (VASP) and the EPW software for calculating materials properties governed by electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. Computation of the e-ph matrix elements with the finite-difference supercell approach in VASP and their fine-grid interpolation in EPW enable accurate modeling of temperature-dependent materials properties and phonon-assisted quantum processes with VASP's extensive library of exchange-correlation functionals and pseudopotentials. We demonstrate the functionality of the EPW-VASP interface by examining the superconducting gap and critical temperature in MgB$_2$ using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations, and the carrier mobility in cubic BN using the \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equation.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the ODMR activity of the telecom range ClV center in SiC: a wavefunction theory analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, density functional theory-based high-throughput screening of point defects in 4H-SiC revealed the positively charged chlorine-vacancy (ClV) defect to be a promising quantum bit candidate emitting at telecom wavelengths, with an electronic structure analogous to the well-known NV center in diamond. Furthermore, recent infrared photoluminescence (PL) measurements on chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC have revealed new PL lines associated with the ClV defect. While the defect possesses a high-spin ground state, there is a lack of evidence of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), a key ingredient for optical spin initialization and readout. In this Letter, we employ a multireference wavefunction-based quantum chemistry method, specifically, second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) on top of a defect-localized many-body wavefunction (CASSCF), to explore the many-body electronic structure of the ClV center. We estimate photoluminescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing rates to investigate the possibility of spin polarization and ODMR activity. Our findings establish the ClV center in 4H-SiC as an optically addressable spin qubit with fiber optics compatibility in the technologically mature 4H-SiC host material, enabling the development of large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spin-lattice coupling in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor revealed by surface acoustic Rayleigh waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic order in van der Waals magnets can strongly influence their lattice dynamics, yet how this interaction manifests across different phonon length scales remains unclear. Optical phonons probe bond-scale exchange modulation and short-range spin correlations, whereas long-wavelength acoustic modes couple to uniform strain fields and are sensitive to the renormalization of the macroscopic elastic tensor associated with long-range magnetic order. Experimentally accessing these low-energy acoustic excitations in low-dimensional crystals is challenging due to their low energies and the small lateral dimensions of exfoliated samples. Here, we employ angle-resolved Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering spectroscopy to investigate the surface acoustic phonon spectrum of exfoliated NiPS3 thin films across their antiferromagnetic transition temperature. Our results show a single Rayleigh surface mode whose phase velocity exhibits a pronounced 5.5% softening upon cooling through the Neel temperature. This anomaly reflects a giant magnetoelastic renormalization of the long-wavelength elastic constants triggered by the onset of zigzag antiferromagnetic order. First-principles calculations of the full elastic tensor, combined with continuum finite-element modelling of the NiPS3/SiO2/Si heterostructure, reproduce both the Rayleigh-wave dispersion and its magnetic-order-induced shift. The obtained results reveal how microscopic exchange interactions shape macroscopic mechanical properties in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors, providing a basis for lattice-controlled magnetism and magnetically tunable phononic, magnonic, and strain-mediated spintronic device concepts.</description>

      <title>Superionicity in Ammonium Polyhydrides at Extreme Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyhydrides have been shown to form novel structures at high pressure, which may be found in the interiors of giant planets. With density functional molecular dynamics simulations we studied the behavior of ammonium polyhydride compounds with stoichiometries of NH$_7$, NH$_9$, NH$_{10}$, NH$_{11}$, NH$_{14}$, NH$_{20}$, and NH$_{24}$ which were predicted with crystal structure search methods to be metastable at 100-300~GPa. For every compound, we performed simulations at a range of temperatures (and for several compounds, pressures) covering the solid, superionic and liquid phases. We show that when heated, high pressure ammonium polyhydride compounds exhibit hydrogen superionic diffusion. We demonstrate a number of metrics by which the solid-to-superionic and superionic-to-liquid transitions can be detected from simulation data, including changes in the internal energy and pressure, formation of new chemical species, and atomic diffusion rates. We find that both the solid-to-superionic and the superionic-to-liquid transitions decrease in temperature as proton fraction increases. These trends indicate that above a proton fraction of $\sim$0.97, ammonium hydride structures are likely to directly melt instead of first exhibiting a superionic phase. Our observed melting trend further indicates that at the extreme conditions of ice giant interiors, hydrogen rich ammonium hydrides such as those studied in this work would exist predominantly as liquids rather than exhibiting a superionic phase.</description>

      <title>Electric Current Control of Helimagnetic Chirality from a Multidomain State in the Helimagnet MnAu$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the domain wall dynamics under electric current in the helimagnet MnAu$_2$. We have found that the threshold electric current of the transition from a multidomain state to a single-chiral domain state in a magnetic field is much lower than that of chirality reversal from a single-chiral domain within certain ranges of temperature and magnetic field. The chirality after the transition depends on whether the magnetic field and electric current were parallel or antiparallel. Numerical calculations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation reproduced the experimental observations. These results indicate that the domain walls are highly mobile in the helimagnet.</description>

      <title>Robust Paramagnon and Acoustic Plasmon in a Photo-excited Electron-doped Cuprate Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the spin and charge degrees of freedom in high-temperature superconducting cuprates under non-equilibrium conditions provides new insights into their electronic correlations. However, their collective dynamics have been largely unexplored due to experimental challenges. Here, we use time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (trRIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to simultaneously track the collective spin (paramagnon) and charge (acoustic plasmon) dynamics in an optimally electron-doped cuprate driven out-of-equilibrium by a femtosecond pump laser pulse. Upon pumping, we observed an anti-Stokes signal associated with paramagnon generation, which modifies the paramagnon dispersion near the zone center, though the bandwidth remained unchanged, suggesting no significant alteration to spin exchange interactions. Simultaneously, in the charge sector, the acoustic plasmon's energy and spectral weight decreased, suggesting a light-induced redistribution of charge carriers. The variations of both the paramagnon and the plasmon were locked in time, demonstrating a robust intertwining between the spin and charge degrees of freedom on a femtosecond timescale, even in this non-equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Scalable Synthesis of Large-Area WS2 Thin Films from Tungsten Precursors by Thermal CVD and Their Application in Schottky-Barrier Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a promising semiconductor for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, but scalable routes to uniform, large-area films remain challenging. In this study, a systematic thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy is presented to synthesize centimeter-scale WS2 thin films by sulfurizing tungsten (W) precursors in a controlled sulfur vapor environment. High-purity sputtered W thin films on SiO2/Si and W foils were sulfurized at temperatures between 400 and 1000 C, with Raman spectroscopy identifying 800 C as the optimal growth temperature. Under these conditions, the films exhibit the characteristic E12g (349.7 cm-1) and A1g (416.8 cm-1) modes with narrow full-width at half-maximum values, indicative of high crystallinity and controlled thickness. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy collectively validate the creation of stoichiometric, layered WS2 with significantly enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness when utilizing sputtered W thin films in contrast to W foils. Leveraging this optimized process, WS2 films grown on W foils were transferred onto target substrates, including indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, using a PMMA-assisted wet-transfer method that preserves structural integrity over large areas. Schottky-barrier solar cells with an Au/WS2/ITO architecture fabricated from these films deliver a short-circuit current density of 7.91 mA cm-2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.495 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.45 percent. These results demonstrate that sulfurization of W thin films and foils via T-CVD provides a scalable, substrate-compatible platform for integrating WS2 into practical optoelectronic and low-cost photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Unraveling UV Stability in Metal Halide Perovskites: From Degradation Mechanisms to Molecular Passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of UV-induced degradation is crucial for enhancing the UV stability of perovskite solar cells. The UV-driven structural dynamics of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) are investigated using real-time TDDFT simulations, revealing that under the electron and hole excitation, the distortion of the inorganic framework (PbI) is primarily driven by the electron occupation of Pb-p and I-p antibonding states, whereas in the hole case, it is mainly governed by the direct cooling induced distortion. We also find that UV accelerates the rotation of MA+ molecules. Further, a BDO molecule is introduced as a passivant, which suppresses structural distortions and provides multi-phonon channels to dissipate carrier cooling energy. Experimental results confirm the UV-protective role of BDO, with suppressed PbI2 formation and improved device stability. These results clarify the mechanism of the UV-induced degradation in the MAPbI3 perovskite and further elucidate how passivation molecules enhance UV stability.</description>

      <title>Patterning perovskite colour converters for AR/VR microdisplays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colour conversion offers the clearest path to achieve RGB colours in high resolution microdisplays for AR/VR. With resolutions beyond 5000 ppi (i.e. RGB pitch of 5 um), the thickness of the conversion layers is critical for efficiency and manufacturing. Perovskites outperform other conversion materials (quantum dots or phosphors) with their high absorption coefficients for blue light. In this contribution, we show how perovskite materials, engineered for high optical density and colour purity, can be patterned to produce colour converting pixels. We demonstrate patterning using three approaches (lift-off, negative photoresist and dry etch), and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The results consolidate the choice of perovskites for AR/VR applications by demonstrating their robustness and compatibility with multiple patterning strategies suitable for high resolution microdisplays.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Breaking Phenomena in MnPS3/TMDC Heterostructures: Non-relativistic Spin Splitting, Altermagnetism and Spin-Valley Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore symmetry-breaking phenomena in MnPS3/TMDC (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2) heterostructures using first-principles calculations, considering two high-symmetry stacking configurations, S1 and S2, which differ not only by their interfacial registry but also by a 30{\deg} twist between the layers. Depending on the stacking geometry, the systems exhibit two distinct types of nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS): S2 hosts altermagnetic-like band crossings, while S1 shows global spin splitting characteristic of symmetry-breaking NRSS. Magnetic exchange and anisotropy parameters indicate that the intrinsic magnetic properties of MnPS3 are largely preserved upon interfacing. Including spin-orbit coupling, we find tunable conduction-valley splitting controlled by the MnPS3 spin orientation. Our results identify MnPS3 as a symmetry-tunable antiferromagnetic substrate capable of inducing and controlling spin and valley effects in 2D heterostructures without relying on net magnetization or strong SOC, offering a route toward nonvolatile valleytronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Reststrahlen band and optical bandgaps in semiconducting CrN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive optical characterization of 200-nm-thick CrN(111) films grown simultaneously on Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) and AlN/Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, spanning the far-infrared to ultraviolet range (0.04 - 5.5 eV), is conducted at room temperature to determine the optical constants $n$ and $k$ of the films. Spectral fits reveal two interband transitions at approximately 0.35 and 0.60 eV. In the infrared range, the ellipsometry data also reveals a pronounced Reststrahlen band stemming from transversal and longitudinal optical phonons at approximately 403 and 629 cm$^{-1}$, respectively. The relative static and high-frequency permittivities are estimated to be about 39 and 15, respectively. A Born effective charge of approximately 2.7, extracted from the far-infrared region, indicates that CrN is partially ionic.</description>

      <title>Screening novel cathode materials from the Energy-GNoME database using MACE machine learning force field and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we set up a screening procedure on the Energy-GNoME database for identifying novel cathode candidates. We use MACE foundational models as a first layer of screening, we assess dynamical stability and estimate the average voltage and gravimetric energy density. Following that, we apply physically motivated reasoning to identify the most promising candidates. Furthermore, we refine the average voltage prediction of selected promising candidates using DFT+U and provide the list of selected materials using this protocol. This work delivers two key outcomes: validation of the foundational MACE models high-throughput screening approach and suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation batteries. Finally, a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy GNoME database is demonstrated on the examined materials.</description>

      <title>Statistical characterization of the spin Hall magnetoresistance in YIG/Pt heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is widely used to study the interplay between charge and spin currents in bilayers of a magnetic insulator and a normal metal. However, not much is known about the spatial variation of the SMR across the surface of one and the same sample. In this work, we investigate the statistical distribution of the SMR in hundreds of nominally identical Hall bar structures patterned into prototypical yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/Pt heterostructures. We find a Gaussian-distributed SMR with a narrow standard deviation of approximately 10$\,$% of the mean value in each YIG/Pt bilayer studied. However, the variation of the mean SMR between different YIG/Pt samples can be as large as ~30$\,$%, despite nominally identical fabrication conditions. This demonstrates that spatial variations of the SMR amplitude must not be neglected, in particular when comparing different heterostructures. On a microscopic level, local variations of the interface quality captured by the spin mixing conductance are the most likely origin for the observed SMR amplitude variations.</description>

      <title>Generative models for crystalline materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in materials is fundamental in condensed matter physics and materials science. Over the past few years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing this understanding and accelerating materials discovery. Early ML approaches primarily focused on constructing and screening large material spaces to identify promising candidates for various applications. More recently, research efforts have increasingly shifted toward generating crystal structures using end-to-end generative models. This review analyzes the current state of generative modeling for crystal structure prediction and \textit{de novo} generation. It examines crystal representations, outlines the generative models used to design crystal structures, and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the review highlights experimental considerations for evaluating generated structures and provides recommendations for suitable existing software tools. Emerging topics, such as modeling disorder and defects, integration in advanced characterization, and incorporating synthetic feasibility constraints, are explored. Ultimately, this work aims to inform both experimental scientists looking to adapt suitable ML models to their specific circumstances and ML specialists seeking to understand the unique challenges related to inverse materials design and discovery.</description>

      <title>A Finite Element Method for Simulation of Coupled Dynamics of Dislocations and Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a finite element method for simulating dynamic processes that involve the coupled evolution of dislocation motion and crack propagation. The method numerically solves the Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) formulation of the conservation of linear momentum. A crystalline material is discretized at the unit-cell level using 6-node prism elements whose geometry allows dislocations and cracks to nucleate and propagate along element facets. Nanoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu, Fe, and Si demonstrate the initiation and propagation of dislocations and cracks, and these results are reproduced by the finite element method in excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Mesoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu further demonstrate the ability of the method to capture size-dependent brittle and ductile behavior. Under plane-strain conditions the Cu model fractures in a brittle manner, while a fully three-dimensional model exhibits curved and intersecting dislocations that blunt the crack tip and prevent crack propagation, resulting in ductile behavior. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for the Formation of Active Sites in Single-Atom Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive dopant atoms embedded in inert host metal surfaces define the active sites in single-atom alloys (SAAs), yet SAA synthesis remains challenging. To address this, we elucidate how dopant adatoms deposited on Cu and Ag surfaces become incorporated into the metal and identify periodic trends from early to late transition metals (TMs) using density functional theory. Adatoms diffuse nearly freely across terraces, as diffusion barriers are small, whereas direct incorporation into terraces is unfavourable. In line with conventional wisdom, step edges and kink sites strongly facilitate dopant incorporation, confirming their critical role in alloy formation. Attachment of adatoms to steps and kinks from the lower terrace is favoured. Incorporation then proceeds either from this attached state or when adatoms approach a step edge from above, where reactions often proceed without barrier. Incorporation barriers are generally lower for early and central TMs, increase towards late TMs, and are slightly higher on Cu than on Ag surfaces. Repulsive interactions between Pd adatoms and dopants explain the experimental observation that a dopant-rich brim on the upper terrace of Cu surfaces inhibits incorporation from above. In contrast, attractive interactions, as found for Ru, anchor diffusing adatoms (even on terraces) and promote the formation of adatom islands, yet hinder incorporation next to the dopant and may impede the growth of embedded dopant clusters. By rationalising periodic trends and experimental observations, we show how specific surface sites and adatom--dopant interactions shape dopant incorporation, offering guidance on the surface environments most conducive to SAA synthesis for different dopant elements.</description>

      <title>Cosserat micropolar and couple-stress elasticity models of flexomagnetism at finite deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose geometrically nonlinear (finite) continuum models of flexomagnetism based on the Cosserat micropolar and its descendent couple-stress theory. These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.</description>

      <title>Characteristic ferroelectric domains and their dynamic behavior in ordered Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pb-based perovskites with multiple cations are fascinating materials showing various phenomena such as high piezoelectric, electromechanical, and relaxor properties. While chemical disordering accompanied by polar nanoregions and nanosized domains is commonly believed to cause the relaxor nature, little is known about ferroelectric microstructures of chemically ordered Pb-based perovskites. In this study, we discovered intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains in chemically ordered ferroelectric Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$ using in-situ transmission electron microscopy with dark-field imaging. Observation results demonstrate that electric polarization can fluctuate around the [111] direction despite the formation of long-range ordered rhombohedral domains, which results in unique weak relaxor properties. In-situ imaging upon heating successfully reveals the dynamic behavior of domain-wall movements with lattice distortion and paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition. Our research provides new insights into the effect of chemical ordering on ferroelectric nanodomains.</description>

      <title>Ready-to-Use Polymerization Simulations Combining Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potential with Time-Dependent Bond Boosting for Polymer and Interface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although polymerization and curing reactions govern the performance of advanced materials, their simulation remains challenging owing to the need for accurate, transferable potentials and rarity of chemical events. Conventional reactive force fields such as ReaxFF require system-specific parametrization, while universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) exhibit limited sampling efficiency. This paper introduces a novel simulation framework integrating a uMLIP with a time-dependent bond-boost scheme. The bias potential increases monotonically with time, and the use of a unified parameter set across reaction classes enables consistent acceleration without system-specific tuning. For radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, the proposed framework reproduces characteristic trends, such as linear molecular-weight growth with conversion, initiator-concentration scaling, and relative monomer reactivity trends. For step-growth polycondensation of nylon-6,6, it captures the characteristic sharp increase in molecular weight at high conversion rates, consistent with experimental behavior. For epoxy curing at a copper substrate, it reveals interfacial ring-opening and cross-linking events, consistent with spectroscopic evidence of Cu-O-C bond formation. Overall, coupling uMLIPs with time-dependent bond boost enables practical and transferable simulations of polymerization and curing processes. The proposed framework reliably resolves mechanistic pathways and relative reactivity, offering molecular-level insights into polymer growth and interfacial adhesion.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Mechanical Property Prediction across Material Classes using Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Universal Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of six universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for predicting the temperature and pressure response of materials by molecular dynamics simulations. Accuracy is evaluated across 13 diverse materials (nine metal-organic frameworks and four inorganic compounds), computing bulk modulus, thermal expansion, and thermal decomposition. These MLIPs employ three different architectures (graph neural networks, graph network simulators, and graph transformers) with varying training datasets. We observe qualitative accuracy across these predictions but systematic underestimation of bulk modulus and overestimation of thermal expansion across all models, consistent with potential energy surface softening. From all tested models, three top performers arise; `MACE-MP-0a', `fairchem_OMAT', and `Orb-v3', with average error across metrics and materials of 41%, 44%, and 47%, respectively. Despite strong overall performance, questions arise about the limits of model transferability: dataset homogeneity and structural representation dominate model accuracy. Our results show that certain architectures can compensate for biases, a step closer to truly universal MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Order-Disorder in Fe-Si Alloys: Implications for Seismic Anisotropy and Thermal Evolution of Earth's Inner Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of Earth's inner core is essential for constraining its composition, thermal evolution, and seismic properties. Silicon is a probable major component of Earth's core. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic modeling, we investigate the structural, elastic, and transport properties of Fe-Si alloys at high pressures and temperatures. By computing the Gibbs free energies of B2, hcp, fcc, and bcc solid solutions, we construct the Fe-Si phase diagram applicable to the Earth's inner core. Our results reveal a pronounced miscibility gap between hcp and B2 Fe-Si, with the two phases coexisting over the compositional range of 6-11 wt% Si at 6000 K. The B2 Fe-Si alloy exhibits strong single-crystal shear anisotropy (22.9% at 6000 K) compared to the nearly isotropic hcp phase (0.6%), and yields a shear wave velocity (3.73 km/s) and Poisson's ratio consistent with seismological observations. Moreover, the computed transport properties reveal substantially lower thermal conductivity of B2 Fe-Si relative to pure iron or hcp Fe-Si under inner-core conditions. These results imply that Earth's inner core likely comprises multiple phases, whose distribution and crystallographic texture critically influence its seismic and thermal properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23001v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, the correlated electron-hole pairs governing optical and transport properties in organic semiconductors, have long resisted direct experimental access to their full quantum-mechanical wave functions. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved photoemission orbital tomography (trPOT), combining high-harmonic probe pulses with time- and momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, to directly image the momentum-space distribution and ultrafast dynamics of excitons in $\alpha$-sexithiophene thin films. We introduce a quantitative model that enables reconstruction of the exciton wave function in real space, including both its spatial extent and its internal phase structure. The reconstructed wave function reveals coherent delocalization across approximately three molecular units and exhibits a characteristic phase modulation, consistent with ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory. Time-resolved measurements further show a $\sim 20$\% contraction of the exciton radius within 400 fs, providing direct evidence of self-trapping driven by exciton-phonon coupling. These results establish trPOT as a general and experimentally accessible approach for resolving exciton wave functions -- with spatial, phase, and temporal sensitivity -- in a broad class of molecular and low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>CsCl seed layer homogenizes co-evaporated perovskite growth for high-efficiency fully textured perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells experienced a significant increase in efficiency, making them viable for industrial applications. Among the various scalable and industry-compatible metal halide perovskite deposition techniques, co-evaporation stands out as particularly well-suited for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells due to its ability to conformally cover textured silicon bottom cells. Solution-processed [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz) is commonly used as a hole-transporting material for co-evaporated metal halide perovskites. However, we show that it covers the textured surface of silicon bottom cells unevenly, impacting the film growth and leading to the formation of residual PbI2 at the buried interface. The present study reveals via X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) that a CsCl seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation across the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface, even in the areas with a thin MeO-2PACz layer, thereby preventing the formation of interfacial PbI2 and leading to larger apparent grains. The improvement of the metal halide perovskite film quality on the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface and the bulk perovskite film led to 30.3% (29.7% certified) efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. The present work highlights the importance of a seed layer for a robust growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite and represents an important milestone for the transfer of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells from laboratory to industry.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Control of Spin Textures in Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites with broken inversion symmetry provide a fertile ground for uncovering coupled spin-orbit and ferroelectric phenomena. Here, we investigate the layered family (PA)$_2$CsY$_2$X$_7$ (Y = Pb, Sn; X = I, Br) using density functional theory, Berry-phase polarization analysis, and effective $\boldsymbol{k \cdot p}$ modeling. Across all four members, we find indirect bandgaps with extrema near $\Gamma$, sizable spin splittings at both band edges, and robust in-plane ferroelectric polarization that stabilizes out-of-plane persistent spin textures (PSTs). Crucially, polarization reversal switches the spin orientation, enabling electrical control of PSTs and thereby non-volatile manipulation of spin states. These results establish (PA)$_2$CsY$_2$X$_7$ as a versatile materials platform where compositional design and ferroelectric switching jointly enable spintronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric topology: the rope weaving in parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology, as a mathematical concept, has been introduced into condensed matter physics since the discovery of quantum Hall effect, which characterizes new physical scenario beyond the Landau theory. The topologically protected physical quantities, such as the dissipationless quantum transport of edge/surface states as well as magnetic/dipole quasi-particles like skyrmions/bimerons, have attracted great research enthusiasms in the past decades. In recent years, another kind of topology in condensed matter was revealed in the magnetoelectric parameter space of multiferroics, which deepens our understanding of magnetoelectric physics. This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft. These exotic topological magnetoelectric behaviors may be helpful to pursuit energy-efficient and precise-control devices for spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A cascade model for the defect-driven etching of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) via the selective electrochemical etching (ECE) of conductive Si-doped layers, separated by non-intentionally doped (NID) layers, provides a straightforward methodology for producing highly reflective DBRs suitable for device overgrowth and integration, which has otherwise proven difficult in the III-nitride epitaxial system via conventional alloying. Such photonic materials can be fabricated by a lithography-free defect-driven etching process, where threading dislocations intrinsic to heteroepitaxy form nanoscale channels that facilitate etchant transport through NID layers. Here, we report the first three-dimensional characterisation of porous GaN-on-Si DBRs fabricated in this methodology with different ECE voltages, using serial-section tomography in a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). These datasets reconstruct the pore morphology as etching proliferates through the alternating Si-doped/NID layer stack. Volumetric reconstruction enabled us to enhance the established `kebab' model for defect-driven etching by proposing a `cascade' model where etchant cascades through the material via vertical etching down nanopipes and horizontal etching across pores, forming complex networks directly related to the pathways taken. This accounts for premature nanopipe termination and discontinuities in nanopipe formation, where dislocations are observed to activate and deactivate individually. Statistical analysis of individual etching behaviour, across all dislocations for each tomograph, revealed a greater tendency to form continuous structures that follow conventional kebab behaviour at higher ECE voltages. We propose that higher ECE voltages alter the probability of dislocation etching relative to doped layer etching, thereby empowering morphological optimization through improved mechanistic understanding of ECE.</description>

      <title>Surface oxidation of Pt and PtPd alloys during NO conversion investigated by Atom Probe Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the dynamic oxidation state changes of pure Pt and 50at% PtPd alloy catalysts were investigated during a temperature ramp from 80 to 450 C under a reactive gas mixture of 500 ppm NO and 3 % Oxygen in Nitrogen atmosphere. These changes are closely correlated with variations in NO conversion efficiency. Sharp tip specimens were prepared from Pt and PtPd alloy wires by electrochemical polishing and Focused Ion Beam annular milling, with the hemispherical apex serving as a model for nanoscale catalyst surfaces. The samples were exposed to the reactive atmosphere in a dedicated reaction chamber and subsequently analyzed using atom probe tomography. Effective oxide thicknesses and three-dimensional surface morphology were quantitatively evaluated. A pronounced decrease in oxide thickness was observed during the first cooling and second heating cycles, particularly below 200 C, indicating reversible redox behavior on both Pt and PtPd alloy surfaces. This behavior correlates with the inverse hysteresis of NO conversion measured for both systems, suggesting that the redox reversibility is driven primarily by reaction kinetics rather than thermodynamic stability.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-induced magnetization reversal in a ferromagnetic film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that moving edge dislocations can induce the reversal of magnetization in a ferromagnetic film due to the Barnett effect. The dynamics of magnetization is studied numerically within a discretized Landau-Lifshitz equation on a hexagonal lattice containing over $10^5$ sites. Local coordinate frames coupled to the crystallographic axes for each spin are used together with the laboratory coordinate frame. The parameters of a hexagonal close-packed cobalt lattice have been chosen for illustration. The magnetization reversal from a metastable initial state created by the external magnetic field occurs on a time scale of a few picoseconds. Our results imply that fast local elastic twists generated by moving dislocations serve as an important mechanism of magnetization dynamics in solids subjected to a mechanical stress.</description>

      <title>Non-local Chemistry Driven by Cation-Anion Size Disparity in Helium Inserted Compounds under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opposing the theory that Helium (He) cannot be inserted into AB-type ionic compounds due to the Madelung energy increase, our crystal structure search and first-principles calculations found that He can form stable compounds with sodium halides (NaX, X=Cl, Br, I) under high-pressure. These reactions are driven by the non-local chemistry arising from the cation-anion size disparity, distinctly different from the He insertion reaction with A2B-type compounds. The large size differences between Na+ and X- enable structures that can effectively host He insertions through volume and inter-atomic distance disproportionation. Furthermore, the insertion of He atoms can significantly relieve the elevated Madelung energy that builds up in NaX under high pressure. This energy increase arises from structural transitions driven by cation-anion size disparity, which are necessary for reducing volume under pressure. The insertion of He allows the reduction of the total volume under high pressure without increasing the Madelung energy. Our predicted compounds and stability analysis reveal a new example of He reactivity governed not by local chemical bond formation, but by long-range electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>On the Generation of Phononic Frequency Combs Using Defect Modes of Phononic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating phononic frequency combs (PFCs) using defect-localized modes in a two-dimensional hexagonal phononic crystal. Localized vibration modes from a singular point defect produce evenly spaced spectral lines corresponding to PFCs. Numerical modelling reveals robust energy transfer under a single-tone drive, generating spectral sidebands. These results demonstrate defect engineering in phononic crystals as a tunable platform for PFC generation with significant applications in high-resolution sensing, timing, and quantum-acoustic technologies.</description>

      <title>Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Anion-Free-Electron Duality and Enhanced Superconducting Role of Interstitial Anionic Electrons in Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting electrides, characterized by interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) residing in lattice cavities, has established a distinctive platform for investigating superconductors. Yet the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation remain poorly understood due to the challenges in directly observing IAEs. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we certify that the IAEs in electride La3In (Tc = 9.4 K) exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. With the finite-depth potential well model, we trace that IAEs originate from electronic states near the Fermi level located above potential barriers, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, triggering superconductivity. ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling. Our findings resolve the long-standing ambiguity regarding the electronic nature of IAEs, elucidate their enhancing superconductivity in the phonon-mediated mechanism, and provide a foundation for exploring advanced electride-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>2D MoS$_2$/Au interfaces for enhanced opto-electronic response with sub-bandgap photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer MoS$_2$ is a direct band gap semiconductor with potential applications in optoelectronics and photonics. MoS$_2$ also has a large optical nonlinearity. However, the atomic thickness of the monolayer limits the strength of the measured functional signals, such as the photocurrent or photoluminescence, in optoelectronic devices. Here, we show that photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$ can be induced by sub-band gap photons by depositing Au nanoparticles on it. In this system, the nonlinear light-matter interaction in Au nanoparticles enhanced by the localized surface plasmons results in the generation of supercontinuum, which is reabsorbed by MoS$_2$ due to efficient resonant energy transfer. Au nanoparticle assisted photocurrent is more than an order of magnitude larger than two-photon photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$. Optimization of the shape, size and composition of the nanoparticle has the potential to enhance the photocurrent significantly with the prospect of applications in the detection of NIR photons, and related technologies including optical telecommunication.</description>

      <title>Complex network analysis of pore structures in monodisperse granular materials with varied grain shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how pore structure influences flow and transport behaviour in granular materials is essential for addressing a wide range of geotechnical, hydraulic, and environmental challenges. These processes are largely shaped by the microscopic arrangement of particles and interconnections between pores within the material. However, detailed insights considering granular assemblies with diversified grain shapes remain scarce. This study introduces a comprehensive framework incorporating Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, image processing, pore-network modelling, and complex network theory to investigate the links between particle morphology and their hydraulic behaviours. Mono-disperse assemblies of natural sand particles with varied shapes are constructed in DEM, and pore networks are extracted through image processing and pore-network modelling. Complex network analysis is then applied to calculate structural metrics that reveal intrinsic relationships between pore microstructures and hydraulic properties. Our results demonstrate that particle morphology significantly impacts pore network characteristics, including pore and throat sizes, closeness centrality, pore structure anisotropy, providing valuable insights into how pore structure influence transport properties.</description>

      <title>Is the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene zero?: The case for a rational definition of the properties of atoms in a molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that the carbon atoms of graphitic samples and their finite analogs have sizable quadrupole moments, with the out-of-plane component ($Q^{\rm C}_{20}$ in traceless spherical coordinates) being the dominate contribution.
  However, there is no consensus on what the quantity is for such carbon-based systems and values reported in the literature range from $Q^{\rm C}_{20} \sim -1.14$ to $+0.79$ a.u.
  In this work we propose a theoretical framework in which well-defined statements can be made about properties of atoms-in-a-molecule (AIMs) even when these properties are not experimentally observable.
  Using this framework and the distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA), we show that the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is essentially zero within the limits of precision of the numerical method used.
  We explain how the experimentally measured atomic quadrupole moment of a graphite sample determined by Whitehouse \&amp; Buckingham likely originated almost entirely from edge dipoles, and we propose a more realistic electrostatic model for finite graphene nanoflakes.</description>

      <title>Integration of 2D Materials in Radial van der Waals Heterostructure Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), exhibit strong excitonic transitions at room temperature and offer a unique platform for exploring light-matter interactions in nanoscale photonic systems. In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $\mu m^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling. This work establishes a scalable approach for generating hybrid photonic-excitonic states with momentum-space structure, offering new opportunities for exciton localization, valley emission, spatially programmable light-matter interaction in two-dimensional material platforms and compact luminescent devices based on 2D material-integrated metasurfaces.</description>

Abstract: A new component for the accurate simulation of neutron scattering from magnetic excitations has been developed for the neutron ray-tracing software McStas. The component SpinWave_BCO simulates inelastic neutron scattering from ferro-, antiferro-, and altermagnetic excitations in a body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure, where the dispersion relation and scattered neutron intensities are derived using linear spin wave theory.
  Data from a simulated Triple-Axis Spectrometer with an extremely high resolution have been verified by direct comparison with theory and by comparison to data simulated using the package SpinW. The component serves as a proof-of-concept for the implementation of a more general linear spin wave component in McStas.</description>

      <title>Active flow-driven DNA remodeling generates millimeter-scale mechanical oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In living systems, DNA undergoes continuous and rhythmic mechanical remodeling through condensation, looping, and disentangling to regulate gene expression, segregate chromosomes, and guide morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a purely mechanical route to rhythmic DNA reorganization in a minimal active composite of microtubules, kinesin motors, and DNA. We embed a DNA polymer in an active turbulent microtubule-kinesin fluid, creating a self-morphing material. The active flows stretch and entangle the DNA, forming a self-organized viscoelastic network that resists active stresses and affects flow over large length scales. This mechanical feedback loop progressively amplifies velocity correlations and drives a nonequilibrium phase transition tuned by DNA contour length: from disordered flow to synchronized, millimeter-scale oscillations with vortices. We rationalize the phase transition with an active-gel model that predicts a growing length scale and an oscillatory instability emerging from the interplay between activity, orientational order, and self-generated viscoelasticity, rather than chemical signaling. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on system size and activity quantitatively agrees with experiment. Thus, flow-driven DNA remodeling provides a minimal physical route to autonomous, system-spanning oscillations in three dimensions and suggests design principles for programmable soft matter that coordinates, actuates, and reshapes itself.</description>

Abstract: This review provides an introduction to the essential physics of soft adhesion, including the thermodynamics of adhesion and wetting, the mechanics of contact with deformable materials, and the material properties that most affect interfacial interactions with soft solid gels and elastomers. Throughout, we emphasize both foundational physics and current experimental and theoretical research in these areas. We conclude with a practical overview of standard experimental test methods for characterizing soft adhesion.

      <title>Discovering topological phases in gray-Tin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($\alpha$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $\alpha$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $\alpha$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Topological Defects in Ferroelectric Nematic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field theories predict that phase transitions sequentially breaking continuous and discrete symmetries can generate hybrid topological structures in which defects of different dimensionalities merge. We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Metastability and Structural Diversity of Hopfions in Chiral Magnetic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological particle-like excitations such as skyrmions and hopfions offer rich opportunities for spintronic and photonic applications. While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control.</description>

      <title>Development of ultra-high efficiency soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy equipped with deep prior-based denoising method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) is one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques to visualize the three-dimensional bulk electronic structure in reciprocal lattice space. Compared with ARPES employing low-energy photon sources, the time burden imposed by a lower photoelectron yield, stemming from the photoionization cross-section, has been a persistent technical challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES ({\mu}SX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds. We demonstrate, through the {\mu}SX-ARPES measurements on a single crystal of CeRu2Si2, that data with sufficient statistical accuracy can be obtained in approximately 40 seconds. In addition, we present the potential of high signal-to-noise ratio ARPES measurement, achieving an energy resolution of 51.6 meV at an excitation energy of 708 eV in {\mu}SX-ARPES measurements on polycrystalline gold. Our developed system successfully reduces the time burden in SX-ARPES and paves the way for advancements in lower photoelectron yield measurements, such as those requiring higher energy resolution and three-dimensional nonequilibrium measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.</description>

      <title>Imaging propagating terahertz collective modes in two-dimensional semiconductor double layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors exhibit a wide range of novel phenomena at millielectronvolt (terahertz-frequency) energy scales, including superconducting and correlation-induced insulating gaps that are frequently accompanied by symmetry breaking. However, due to the subwavelength dimensions and the often low conductivities of these systems, their intrinsic THz plasmons and meV-scale excitation gaps are difficult to access experimentally. Here we report an optical readout method that can image propagating THz-frequency collective modes in real time. The method relies on a strong coupling between the optical polarons of monolayer TMD semiconductors and the local THz fields in a waveguide, which enables us to image THz plasmons with micron scale spatial resolution and determine their propagation group velocities. Moreover, at finite magnetic fields, we observe coherent cyclotron oscillations resulting from Landau level repopulation induced by the THz field. Our findings provide a new near-field platform for probing collective excitations in strongly correlated two-dimensional semiconductors and enable "all-photonic" TMD-based architectures for time-domain THz plasmonics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of near-EF van Hove singularity and in-gap topological Dirac surface states in superconducting electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting electrides have attracted growing attention for their potential to achieve high superconducting transition temperatures (TC) under pressure. However, many known electrides are chemically reactive and unstable, making high-quality single-crystal growth, characterization, and measurements difficult, and most do not exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. In contrast, La3In stands out for its ambient-pressure superconductivity (TC ~ 9.4 K) and the availability of high-quality single crystals. Here, we investigate its low-energy electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals. A saddle point is directly observed at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary, while a three-dimensional van Hove singularity crosses EF at the BZ corner. First-principles calculations further reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap above EF. The coexistence of a high density of states and in-gap topological surface states near EF suggests that La3In offers a promising platform for tuning superconductivity and exploring possible topological superconducting phases through doping or external pressure.</description>

      <title>Toward Unified Interphase Engineering: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase in Batteries and Supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage requires devices that combine the high energy density of batteries with the power capability and long cycle life of supercapacitors. However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation. By identifying shared mechanisms and establishing transferable design rules, this unified framework provides a foundation for predictive interphase engineering that supports long-lived, high-performance energy-storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Trion gas on the surface of a failed excitonic insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trions, three-body bound states composed of an exciton and an additional charge, are typically fragile and require external excitation to form. Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of the layered semiconductor Ta2NiS5, revealed through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory. Instead, we argue that it arises from the formation of negative trions, stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Unlike excitons, these trions form without optical pumping and persist at equilibrium, marking a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a nominally conventional semiconductor. Our findings establish Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for exploring many-body physics at surfaces and open new avenues for studying and controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</description>

      <title>Dual topology and edge-reconstruction in $\alpha$-Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the tight-binding model for cubic $\alpha$-Sn based on the DFT calculations. In the model, we incorporate a variable bond angle, which allows us to simulate the effect of the in-plane strain. In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $\alpha$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $\alpha$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Helix alignment, chevrons, and edge dislocations in twist-bend ferroelectric nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore surface alignment and edge dislocations in the recently discovered twist-bend ferroelectric nematic, NTBF, in which the vector of spontaneous polarization follows an oblique helicoidal trajectory around a polar twist-bend axis. In a planar cell, the polar axis aligns at some angle to the rubbing direction to mitigate surface electric charge. We demonstrate that the pseudolayers in planar cells form chevron defects, a hallmark defect of one-dimensionally positionally ordered phases, such as smectic A and smectic C. The polar character of the twist-bend axis prevents the cores of NTBF edge dislocations from splitting into semi-integer disclinations, in stark contrast to dislocations in paraelectric and ferroelectric chiral nematics. The tilt of pseudolayers around the defect core allows us to estimate the elastic penetration length as being close to the pitch of NTBF. Compression/dilation stresses around the core modify the heliconical tilt angle of molecules as evidenced by a substantial variation in local birefringence. The climb of dislocations exhibits high mobility, allowing the system to equilibrate the temperature-dependent pitch. The uncovered properties facilitate the development of NTBF materials for electro-optical applications, such as electrically controlled diffraction lattices and structural colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of high-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) has entered a critical stage, where entropy-driven strategies offer transformative potential for enhancing electrochemical properties. By engineering local environments for conductive ions alongside introducing disorder, these approaches can significantly improve conductivity. However, embracing high-entropy designs does not always guarantee improved performance. Current entropy descriptions oversimplify disorder by accounting solely for host framework configurations, neglecting conductive ion-induced disorder, rendering such descriptions incomplete. Herein, we propose path entropy (Sp) as a descriptor that quantifies diffusion pathway diversity, directly capturing diffusional disorder. Combining Markov state model with transition path theory, we reveal the interplay between diffusion pathway diversity of lithium and microscopic local environments in inorganic thiophosphates. Generalizing this path-informative Sp for high-throughput screening, we demonstrate its broad applicability in identifying and designing high-performance SSEs. Our work establishes a critical link between entropy evolution underlying ion conduction and practical entropy-driven design principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the relationship between magnetostriction and magnetic damping is often described phenomenologically, their intrinsic connection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the magnitude of magnetic damping depends on the sign of magnetostriction in ($\mathrm{Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{4}N}$ and $\mathrm{Ni_{1-y}Co_{y}}$ alloys across various compositions, consistent with experimental observations. This behavior is attributed to strain-induced changes in exchange splitting, which shift the minority spin density of states near the Fermi level, thereby affecting both magnetostriction and damping through spin-conserving transitions. Additionally, the presence of locally degenerate orbitals plays a crucial role in determining magnetostriction. These findings suggest that magnetization dynamics and magnetostriction can be intrinsically controlled, facilitating the design of magnetic materials for applications such as flexible spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We present a combined computational and experimental investigation of the thermal properties of uranium nitride (UN), focusing on the development of a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. The MLIP was trained on density functional theory (DFT) data and validated against various quantities including energies, forces, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and defect formation energies, achieving excellent agreement with DFT calculations, prior experimental results and our thermal conductivity measurement. The potential was then employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict key thermal properties such as melting point, thermal expansion, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. To further assess model accuracy, we fabricated a UN sample and performed new thermal conductivity measurements representative of single-crystal properties, which showed strong agreement with the MLIP predictions. This work confirms the reliability and predictive capability of the developed potential for determining the thermal properties of UN.</description>

      <title>The effect of multi-occupancy traps on the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes in irradiated tungsten and vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computational scheme for the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes (HI) with multi-occupancy traps parameterized by first principles calculations. We show that it is often acceptable to reduce the complexity of the coupled differential equations for gas evolution by taking the dynamic steady state, a generalisation of the Oriani equilibrium for multiple isotopes and multi-occupancy traps. The effective gas diffusivity varies most with mobile fraction when the total gas concentration approximates the trap density. We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten. The vacancy distribution is estimated with molecular dynamics, and the retention across sample depth shows good agreement with experiment using no fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>On the nature and charge state of the X-Defect, a radiation-induced Silicon defect with field-enhanced charge carrier emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elusive X-Defect, a defect found in low-resistivity $p$-type Silicon after irradiation, observed as a low-temperature shoulder of the $\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{O}_\mathrm{i}$ defect (Boron-interstitial-Oxygen-interstitial complex) in Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) measurements, was investigated to determine its properties, matching them with those of a previously identified defect. Through a combination of TSC, Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Difference-DLTS (DDLTS), numerical simulations of field-enhanced charge carrier emissions in TSC measurements and a comparison to literature, the X-Defect was identified as the singly positively charged Silicon di-vacancy $\mathrm{V}_2(+/0)$. This assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel (PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced X-Defect. Assigning the X-Defect to an electrically neutral defect in the space charge region resolves previous contradictions regarding its deficiency in impacting on the effective doping concentration.</description>

      <title>Theory of tunnel magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions with hexagonal boron nitride barriers: mechanism and application to ferromagnetic alloy electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), with its strong in-plane bonding and good lattice match to hcp and fcc metals, offers a promising alternative barrier material for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we investigate spin-dependent transport in hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$$/$$h$-BN$/$hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$(0001) MTJs with physisorption-type interfaces using first-principles calculations. We find that a high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface states of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\Delta_1$-like symmetry around the $\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by reducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in momentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing antiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is analogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial distance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in MTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings provide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer guidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components, offering new avenues for engineering spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>A ferroelectric junction transistor memory made from switchable van der Waals p-n heterojunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) p-n heterojunctions are important building blocks for advanced electronics and optoelectronics, in which high-quality heterojunctions essentially determine device performances or functionalities. Creating tunable depletion regions with substantially suppressed leakage currents presents huge challenges, but is crucial for heterojunction applications. Here, by using band-aligned p-type SnSe and n-type ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 as a model, we report near-ideal multifunctional vdW p-n heterojunctions with small reverse leakage currents (0.1 pA) and a desired diode ideality factor (1.95). We realize ferroelectric-tuned band alignment with a giant barrier modulation of 900 meV. Based on such tunable heterojunctions, we propose and demonstrate a fundamental different memory device termed ferroelectric junction field-effect transistor memory, which shows large memory windows (1.8 V), ultrafast speed (100 ns), high operation temperature (393 K), and low cycle-to-cycle variation (2 %). Additionally, the reliable synaptic characteristics of these memory devices promise low-power neuromorphic computing. Our work provides a new device platform with switchable memory heterojunctions, applicable to high performance brain-inspired electronics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Origin of Photoluminescence Quenching in Colloidal MoS2 and WS2 Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large chemical tunability and strong light-matter interactions make colloidal transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanostructures particularly suitable for light-emitting applications. However, ultrafast exciton decay and quenched photoluminescence (PL) limit their potential. Combining femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with first-principles calculations on MoS2 and WS2 nanoplatelets, we reveal that the observed sub-picosecond exciton decay originates from edge-located optically bright hole traps. These intrinsic trap states stem from the metal d-orbitals and persist even when the sulfur-terminated edges are hydrogen-passivated. Notably, WS2 nanostructures show more localized and optically active edge states than their MoS2 counterparts, and zigzag edges exhibit a higher trap density than armchair edges. The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombination, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL.</description>

      <title>Pseudopotentials for Orbital-Free DFT: Capturing Nonlocality and Correcting Functional Approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Crystalline Materials with Record Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity via a Universal Descriptor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralow glass-like lattice thermal conductivity in crystalline materials is crucial for enhancing energy conversion efficiency in thermoelectrics and thermal insulators. We introduce a universal descriptor for thermal conductivity that relies only on the atomic number in the primitive cell and the sound velocity, enabling fast and scalable materials screening. Coupled with high-throughput workflows and universal machine learning potentials, we identify the candidate materials with ultralow thermal conductivity from over 25, 000 materials. We further validate this approach by experimentally confirming record-low thermal conductivity values of 0.15-0.16 W/m/K from 170 to 400 K in the halide metal CsAg2I3. Combining inelastic neutron scattering with first-principles calculations, we attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the intrinsically small sound velocity, strong anharmonicity, and structural complexity. Our work illustrates how a universal descriptor, combined with high-throughput screening, machine-learning potential and experiment, enables the efficient discovery of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimization in high dimensional space by deep kernel learning augmented genetic algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration of complex high-dimensional spaces presents significant challenges in fields such as molecular discovery, process optimization, and supply chain management. Genetic Algorithms (GAs), while offering significant power for creating new candidate spaces, often entail high computational demands due to the need for evaluation of each new proposed solution. On the other hand, Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) efficiently navigates the spaces of preselected candidate structures but lacks generative capabilities. This study introduces an approach that amalgamates the generative power of GAs to create new candidates with the efficiency of DKL-based surrogate models to rapidly ascertain the behavior of new candidate spaces. This DKL-GA framework can be further used to build Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the optimization of the FerroSIM model, showcasing its broad applicability to diverse challenges, including molecular discovery and battery charging optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75~ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15~seconds at zero magnetic field between 50~mK and 1~K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrepancy between quantum distinguishability in Hilbert space and classical distinguishability in probability space is expressed by the gap between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices (QFIM and CFIM, respectively). This intrinsic quantum obstruction is generally not saturable and plays a central role in both fundamental insights and practical applications in modern quantum physics. Here, we develop a geometrical framework for this gap by introducing the notion of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We relate this quantity to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part equals the QFIM. We prove the matrix inequality between QGT and SCGT, which sharpens the standard inequality between QFIM and CFIM and provides novel multiparameter information bounds: the real part of the SCGT reproduces the CFIM plus an additional nonnegative contribution capturing quantum obstruction. This further motivates a natural extension of the Berry phase to the semi-classical setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved through improvements in electrical efficiency in devices containing V-defects. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to reduced barrier heights for charge injection in thinned, low-Indium quantum wells parallel to semi-polar V-defect facets. To test this proposition, a novel approach in which the tip of a scanning tunneling luminescence microscope as a local hole injector, is used to map the optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-defects with nanoscale spatial resolution. A 1 V reduction in the forward bias necessary for current injection at V-defect rims is observed. This, combined with the observation of small (~10 meV) blue shifts in the locally emitted electroluminescence, unambiguously confirms the charge injection mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In materials known as failed insulators, electrical resistivity increases as temperature decreases, yet does not diverge - a phenomenon inconsistent with single-particle theories. We investigate the origin of this behavior by measuring shot noise in nanojunctions of nitrogen-doped beta-Ta, a prototypical failed insulator. Junctions as short as 8 nanometers exhibit hot-electron shot noise, indicating strong electron interactions. We show that charge hopping mediated by these interactions explains the anomalous electronic properties. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting electron interactions in spin-orbitronic and superconducting applications of failed insulators.</description>

      <title>Beyond Germanides: Anomalous Hall Effect in the Silicide LaMn2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining symmetry analysis and direct density functional calculations including the spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that anomalous Hall effect can be observed in not only germanides with general formula RMn$_2$Ge$_2$, where $R$ is a rare-earth ion or Y. Our calculations predict a large anomalous Hall conductivity in LaMn$_2$Si$_2$, with a non-zero $\sigma_{xy}^{AH}$ component of $-360~\text{S/cm}$, accompanied by a pronounced magneto-optical response. Remarkably, electron doping of LaMn$_2$Si$_2$ is expected to substantially enhance the Hall conductivity, with values reaching up to -650 S/cm. These results suggest that silicides with general formula RM$_2$Si$_2$ can be an interesting platform for studying anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Automated Constitutive Model Discovery by Pairing Sparse Regression Algorithms with Model Selection Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well in discovering isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and reshape a material's spatial symmetry. Because the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is exquisitely sensitive to symmetry, it offers a natural arena for magnetic-field control. Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.</description>
