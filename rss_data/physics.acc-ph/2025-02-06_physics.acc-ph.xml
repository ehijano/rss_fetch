      <title>Observation of transition radiation carrying orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted photons carrying orbital angular momentum, which have potential applications spanning diverse fields, have been extensively studied since the theoretical work of Allen \textit{et al}. in 1992. Various methods for direct producing twisted photons have been explored, leveraging the rotational (spiral) motion of relativistic electrons in phenomena such as undulator radiation. In the present study, transition radiation carrying orbital angular momentum is observed for the first time. This radiation was generated by 220 MeV electrons incident on an Au-coated Si wafer. The orbital angular momentum was measured by analyzing the diffraction patterns produced as the radiation passed through a triangular aperture and a double slit. These results demonstrate that twisted photons can also be generated through the interaction of rectilinearly moving electrons with a solid target.</description>

      <title>Application of Flex-QA Arrays in HTS Magnet Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible PCB quench antennas have been very useful in providing high-quality high-resolution data in low temperature superconducting magnet tests. Similar multi-sensor arrays have been employed recently to cover a high temperature superconductor magnet tested at FNAL. In the present work, data taking conditions and magnet features to support the analysis framework are discussed. Then observations made during complete magnet powering cycles are described and analysis of quench antenna data are presented. Based on results, improvements to instrumentation and data taking are debated. Views on the future of flexible quench antenna sensors for HTS magnet diagnostics and operational support are shared.</description>

      <title>HEP High Power Targetry Roadmap -- Workshop Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a reliable target is already a challenge for MW-class facilities today and has led several major accelerator facilities to operate at lower than design power due to target concerns. With present plans to increase beam power for next generation accelerator facilities in the next decade, timely R and D in support of robust high power targets is critical to secure the full physics benefits of ambitious accelerator power upgrades. A comprehensive R and D program must be implemented to address the many complex challenges faced by multi MW beam intercepting devices. This roadmap is envisioned to be helpful to the DOE-OHEP office when planning and prioritizing future R and D activities as well as leveraging synergies across the Office of Science. The roadmap will be extremely beneficial to the broader (external to DOE HEP) HPT community by communicating OHEP s high level strategy and objectives for HPT R and D and highlighting possible opportunities for collaboration.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization Model for Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) model to describe the magnetization and instantaneous power loss of composite superconductors subject to time-varying magnetic fields. Once the parameters of the ROHM model are fixed based on reference simulations, it allows to directly compute the macroscopic response of composite superconductors without the need to solve the detailed current density distribution. It can then be used as part of a homogenization method in large-scale superconducting models to significantly reduce the computational effort compared to detailed simulations. In this contribution, we focus on the case of a strand with twisted superconducting filaments subject to a time-varying transverse magnetic field. We propose two variations of the ROHM model: (i) a rate-independent model that reproduces hysteresis in the filaments, and (ii) a rate-dependent model that generalizes the first level by also reproducing dynamic effects due to coupling and eddy currents. We then describe the implementation and inclusion of the ROHM model in a finite element framework, discuss how to deduce the model parameters, and finally demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of excitation frequencies and amplitudes.</description>
