      <title>Investigating Self-regulated Learning Sequences within a Generative AI-based Intelligent Tutoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing trend in employing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) techniques to support learning. Moreover, scholars have reached a consensus on the critical role of self-regulated learning (SRL) in ensuring learning effectiveness within GenAI-assisted learning environments, making it essential to capture students' dynamic SRL patterns. In this study, we extracted students' interaction patterns with GenAI from trace data as they completed a problem-solving task within a GenAI-assisted intelligent tutoring system. Students' purpose of using GenAI was also analyzed from the perspective of information processing, i.e., information acquisition and information transformation. Using sequential and clustering analysis, this study classified participants into two groups based on their SRL sequences. These two groups differed in the frequency and temporal characteristics of GenAI use. In addition, most students used GenAI for information acquisition rather than information transformation, while the correlation between the purpose of using GenAI and learning performance was not statistically significant. Our findings inform both pedagogical design and the development of GenAI-assisted learning environments.</description>

      <title>Lex Reformatica: Five Principles of Policy Reform for the Technological Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, Joel Reidenberg argued that technology itself, not just law and regulation, imposes rules on communities in the Information Society. System design choices like network architecture and configurations create regulatory norms he termed "Lex Informatica"-referencing the merchant-driven medieval "Lex Mercatoria" that emerged independent of sovereign control. Today we face different challenges requiring us to revisit Reidenberg's insights and examine the consequences of that earlier era. While Lex Informatica provided a framework for analyzing the internet's birth, we now confront the aftereffects of decades of minimal or absent regulation. Critical questions emerge: When technological social norms develop outside clear legal restraints, who benefits and who suffers? This new era demands infrastructural reform focused on the interplay between public and private regulation and self-regulation, weighing both costs and benefits. Rather than showcasing the promise of yesterday's internet age, today's events reveal the pitfalls of information libertarianism and underscore the urgent need for new approaches to information regulation. This Issue presents articles from two symposiums-one on Lex Informatica and another on race and technology law. Their conversation is now essential. Together, these papers demonstrate what I call the "Lex Reformatica" of today's digital age. This collection shows why scholars, lawyers, and legislators must return to Reidenberg's foundational work and update its trajectory toward a reform-focused approach designed for our current era.</description>

      <title>Beyond Simulations: What 20,000 Real Conversations Reveal About Mental Health AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet existing safety evaluations rely primarily on small, simulation-based test sets that have an unknown relationship to the linguistic distribution of real usage. In this study, we present replications of four published safety test sets targeting suicide risk assessment, harmful content generation, refusal robustness, and adversarial jailbreaks for a leading frontier generic AI model alongside an AI purpose built for mental health support. We then propose and conduct an ecological audit on over 20,000 real-world user conversations with the purpose-built AI designed with layered suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) safeguards to compare test set performance to real world performance. While the purpose-built AI was significantly less likely than general-purpose LLMs to produce enabling or harmful content across suicide/NSSI (.4-11.27% vs 29.0-54.4%), eating disorder (8.4% vs 54.0%), and substance use (9.9% vs 45.0%) benchmark prompts, test set failure rates for suicide/NSSI were far higher than in real-world deployment. Clinician review of flagged conversations from the ecological audit identified zero cases of suicide risk that failed to receive crisis resources. Across all 20,000 conversations, three mentions of NSSI risk (.015%) did not trigger a crisis intervention; among sessions flagged by the LLM judge, this corresponds to an end-to-end system false negative rate of .38%, providing a lower bound on real-world safety failures. These findings support a shift toward continuous, deployment-relevant safety assurance for AI mental-health systems rather than limited set benchmark certification.</description>

      <title>From Noise to Insights: Enhancing Supply Chain Decision Support through AI-Based Survey Integrity Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of survey data is crucial in supply chain decision-making, particularly when evaluating readiness for AI-driven tools such as safety stock optimization systems. However, surveys often attract low-effort or fake responses that degrade the accuracy of derived insights. This study proposes a lightweight AI-based framework for filtering unreliable survey inputs using a supervised machine learning approach. In this expanded study, a larger dataset of 99 industry responses was collected, with manual labeling to identify fake responses based on logical inconsistencies and response patterns. After preprocessing and label encoding, both Random Forest and baseline models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) were trained to distinguish genuine from fake responses. The best-performing model achieved an 92.0% accuracy rate, demonstrating improved detection compared to the pilot study. Despite limitations, the results highlight the viability of integrating AI into survey pipelines and provide a scalable solution for improving data integrity in supply chain research, especially during product launch and technology adoption phases.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Spanish Gastroenterology: high expectations, limited integration. A national survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17011v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive innovation in medicine, yet its adoption within gastroenterology remains limited and poorly characterized. We aimed to examine knowledge, practical applications, perceived barriers, and expectations regarding AI among gastroenterology specialists in Spain. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a structured online survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology (SEPD) in 2025. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic data, patterns of AI use, perceptions, and educational needs. Descriptive statistics and multivariable models were applied. Results: Among 283 respondents (mean age 44.6 +/- 9.7 years), 87.5% acknowledged AI as a transformative tool, but only 60.2% (95% CI: 54.3-66.1%) reported using it, mostly outside institutional frameworks. Notably, 80.2% of users initiated AI use within the past year. Independent predictors of frequent use included previous training (OR=2.44), employment in university hospitals (OR=2.14), and younger age (OR=1.36 per 5-year decrease). Main barriers were lack of training (61%), absence of institutional strategies (46%), and ethical concerns (50%). While 93.8% agreed that AI training programmes are necessary, only 18.4% had received formal training. Conclusions: A substantial gap exists between the favorable perception of AI and its actual integration into clinical practice within Spanish gastroenterology. The rapid adoption outside institutional frameworks underscores the urgent need for accredited training programmes and governance standards led by scientific societies.</description>

      <title>The Digital Divide in Geriatric Care: Why Usability, Not Access, is the Real Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the world's aging population to 16% by the year 2050 spurs the need for the application of digital health solutions to enhance older individuals' independence, accessibility, and well-being. While digital health technologies such as telemedicine, wearables, and mobile health applications can transform geriatric care, their adoption among older individuals is not evenly distributed. This study redefines the "digital divide" among older health care as a usability divide, contends that user experience (UX) poor design is the primary adoption barrier, rather than access. Drawing on interdisciplinary studies and design paradigms, the research identifies the main challenges: visual, cognitive, and motor impairment; complicated interfaces; and lack of co-creation with older adults, and outlines how participatory, user-focused, and inclusive notions of design can transcend them. Findings reveal that older persons easily embrace those technologies that are intuitive, accessible, and socially embedded as they promote autonomy, confidence, and equity in health. The study identifies the effects of the design attributes of high-contrast screens, lower interaction flow, multimodal feedback, and caregiver integration as having strong influences on usability outcomes. In addition, it critiques the current accessibility guidelines as being technically oriented rather than experiential and demands an ethical, empathetic understanding of design grounded in human-centered usability rather than technical accessibility in itself.</description>

      <title>Private Accountability in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Article, I explore the impending conflict between the protection of civil rights and artificial intelligence (AI). While both areas of law have amassed rich and well-developed areas of scholarly work and doctrinal support, a growing body of scholars are interrogating the intersection between them. This Article argues that the issues surrounding algorithmic accountability demonstrate a deeper, more structural tension within a new generation of disputes regarding law and technology. As I argue, the true promise of AI does not lie in the information we reveal to one another, but rather in the questions it raises about the interaction of technology, property, and civil rights. For this reason, I argue that we are looking in the wrong place if we look only to the state to address issues of algorithmic accountability. Instead, we must turn to other ways to ensure more transparency and accountability that stem from private industry, rather than public regulation. The issue of algorithmic bias represents a crucial new world of civil rights concerns, one that is distinct in nature from the ones that preceded it. Since we are in a world where the activities of private corporations, rather than the state, are raising concerns about privacy, due process, and discrimination, we must focus on the role of private corporations in addressing the issue. Towards this end, I discuss a variety of tools to help eliminate the opacity of AI, including codes of conduct, impact statements, and whistleblower protection, which I argue carries the potential to encourage greater endogeneity in civil rights enforcement. Ultimately, by examining the relationship between private industry and civil rights, we can perhaps develop a new generation of forms of accountability in the process.</description>

      <title>Measuring Political Stance and Consistency in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the incredible advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), many people have started using them to satisfy their information needs. However, utilizing LLMs might be problematic for political issues where disagreement is common and model outputs may reflect training-data biases or deliberate alignment choices. To better characterize such behavior, we assess the stances of nine LLMs on 24 politically sensitive issues using five prompting techniques. We find that models often adopt opposing stances on several issues; some positions are malleable under prompting, while others remain stable. Among the models examined, Grok-3-mini is the most persistent, whereas Mistral-7B is the least. For issues involving countries with different languages, models tend to support the side whose language is used in the prompt. Notably, no prompting technique alters model stances on the Qatar blockade or the oppression of Palestinians. We hope these findings raise user awareness when seeking political guidance from LLMs and encourage developers to address these concerns.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Railway Traffic Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving traffic management in case of perturbation is one of the main challenges in today's railway research. The great majority of the existing literature proposes approaches to make centralized decisions to minimize delay propagation. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to the same aim: we design and implement a modular process to allow trains to self-organize. This process consists in having trains identifying their neighbors, formulating traffic management hypotheses, checking their compatibility and selecting the best ones through a consensus mechanism. Finally, these hypotheses are merged into a directly applicable traffic plan. In a thorough experimental analysis on a portion of the Italian network, we compare the results of self-organization with those of a state-of-the-art centralized approach. In particular, we make this comparison mimicking a realistic deployment thanks to a closed-loop framework including a microscopic railway simulator. The results indicate that self-organization achieves better results than the centralized algorithm, specifically thanks to the definition and exploitation of the instance decomposition allowed by the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Evolution of Critical Thinking, Creativity, Communication and Collaboration in Higher Education Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Creativity, Communication, Critical Thinking, and Collaboration (the 4Cs) is a central objective of contemporary competency-based education. However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules.</description>

      <title>The Three Axes of Success: A Three-Dimensional Framework for Career Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Career decision-making is a socio-technical problem: individuals exercise bounded agency while navigating labor market institutions, organizational incentive structures, and information asymmetries that shape feasible trajectories. Existing frameworks optimize along single dimensions - financial returns, work-life balance, or mission alignment - without explicit models for inter-dimensional tradeoffs or temporal dynamics. We propose The Three Axes of Success, a normative decision framework decomposing career trajectories into Wealth (career capital accumulation and economic optionality), Autonomy (control over task selection, temporal allocation, and strategic direction), and Meaning (counterfactual social impact scaled by problem importance and personal replaceability). We formalize coupling dynamics between axes: the adjacent possible mechanism by which skill frontiers enable mission discovery, creating nonlinear Wealth -&gt; Meaning transitions; autonomy prerequisites where insufficient career capital triggers control traps; and dual-career household constraints that yield Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria under independent optimization. We operationalize each axis through measurable proxies, analyze prototypical career archetypes - industrial R&amp;D, academia, entrepreneurship - as points in (W, A, M)-space, and derive sequential versus simultaneous optimization strategies under uncertainty. The framework converts implicit career anxiety into explicit multi-objective optimization problems with satisficing thresholds, structuring the human-system interaction between individual deliberation and institutional constraints. This provides the first unified decision-theoretic treatment of career success, integrating insights from human capital theory, self-determination theory, and effective altruism into a coherent architecture for rational career design.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Computer Science Learning in the AI Era: Open Generative AI Policies and Assignment-Driven Written Quizzes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has created a pressing challenge in computer science (CS) education: how to incorporate powerful AI tools into programming coursework without undermining student learning through cognitive offloading. This paper presents an assessment model that permits the use of generative AI for take-home programming assignments while enforcing individual mastery through immediate, assignment-driven written quizzes. To promote authentic learning, these in-class, closed-book assessments are weighted more heavily than the assignments themselves and are specifically designed to verify the student's comprehension of the algorithms, structure, and implementation details of their submitted code. Preliminary empirical data were collected from an upper-level computer science course to examine the relationship between self-reported GenAI usage and performance on AI-free quizzes, exams, and final course grades. Statistical analyses revealed no meaningful linear correlation between GenAI usage levels and assessment outcomes, with Pearson correlation coefficients consistently near zero. These preliminary results suggest that allowing GenAI for programming assignments does not diminish students' mastery of course concepts when learning is verified through targeted, assignment-driven quizzes. Although limited by a small sample size, this study provides preliminary evidence that the risks of cognitive offloading can be mitigated by allowing AI-assisted programming practice while verifying understanding through assignment-driven, AI-free quizzes. The findings support the responsible adoption of open GenAI policies in upper-level CS courses, when paired with rigorous, independent assessment mechanisms.</description>

      <title>(Mis-)Informed Consent: Predatory Apps and the Exploitation of Populations with Limited Literacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among populations with limited literacy in emerging digital markets, the adoption of mobile phones, combined with comprehension barriers and poor cybersecurity hygiene, has created hidden privacy risks. This paper examines how informed consent is often abused by predatory financial applications, leading to financial scams that disproportionately affect users with low literacy. We focus on predatory loan, gambling, and trading apps, analyzing a dataset of 50 Google Play Store apps to measure how many omit or obfuscate critical privacy disclosures. We also evaluate comprehension gaps among users with low literacy via a targeted user study and assess whether Large Language Model (LLM)-generated summaries, translations, and visual cues can improve consent clarity. Our findings show that 85% of study participants did not understand basic app permissions, underscoring the urgent need for stronger regulatory oversight and scalable LLM-driven privacy-literacy tools.</description>

      <title>Failing on Bias Mitigation: Investigating Why Predictive Models Struggle with Government Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for bias and unfairness in AI-supporting government services raises ethical and legal concerns. Using crime rate prediction with the Bristol City Council data as a case study, we examine how these issues persist. Rather than auditing real-world deployed systems, our goal is to understand why widely adopted bias mitigation techniques often fail when applied to government data. Our findings reveal that bias mitigation approaches applied to government data are not always effective -- not because of flaws in model architecture or metric selection, but due to the inherent properties of the data itself. Through comparing a set of comprehensive models and fairness methods, our experiments consistently show that the mitigation efforts cannot overcome the embedded unfairness in the data -- further reinforcing that the origin of bias lies in the structure and history of government datasets. We then explore the reasons for the mitigation failures in predictive models on government data and highlight the potential sources of unfairness posed by data distribution shifts, the accumulation of historical bias, and delays in data release. We also discover the limitations of the blind spots in fairness analysis and bias mitigation methods when only targeting a single sensitive feature through a set of intersectional fairness experiments. Although this study is limited to one city, the findings are highly suggestive, which can contribute to an early warning that biases in government data may persist even with standard mitigation methods.</description>

      <title>AI, Metacognition, and the Verification Bottleneck: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study of Human Problem-Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This longitudinal pilot study tracked how generative AI reshapes problem-solving over six months across three waves in an academic setting. AI integration reached saturation by Wave 3, with daily use rising from 52.4% to 95.7% and ChatGPT adoption from 85.7% to 100%. A dominant hybrid workflow increased 2.7-fold, adopted by 39.1% of participants. The verification paradox emerged: participants relied most heavily on AI for difficult tasks (73.9%) yet showed declining verification confidence (68.1%) where performance was worst (47.8% accuracy on complex tasks). Objective performance declined systematically: 95.2% to 81.0% to 66.7% to 47.8% across problem difficulty, with belief-performance gaps widening to 34.6 percentage points. This indicates a fundamental shift where verification, not solution generation, became the bottleneck in human-AI problem-solving. The ACTIVE Framework synthesizes findings grounded in cognitive load theory: Awareness and task-AI alignment, Critical verification protocols, Transparent human-in-the-loop integration, Iterative skill development countering cognitive offloading, Verification confidence calibration, and Ethical evaluation. The authors provide implementation pathways for institutions and practitioners. Key limitations include sample homogeneity (academic cohort only, convenience sampling) limiting generalizability to corporate, clinical, or regulated professional contexts; self-report bias in confidence measures (32.2 percentage point divergence from objective performance); lack of control conditions; restriction to mathematical/analytical problems; and insufficient timeframe to assess long-term skill trajectories. Results generalize primarily to early-adopter, academically affiliated populations. Causal validation requires randomized controlled trials.</description>

      <title>Initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent systems have become remarkably sophisticated. They hold conversations, write essays, and seem to understand context in ways that surprise even their creators. This raises a crucial question: Are we creating systems that are conscious? The Digital Consciousness Model (DCM) is a first attempt to assess the evidence for consciousness in AI systems in a systematic, probabilistic way. It provides a shared framework for comparing different AIs and biological organisms, and for tracking how the evidence changes over time as AI develops. Instead of adopting a single theory of consciousness, it incorporates a range of leading theories and perspectives - acknowledging that experts disagree fundamentally about what consciousness is and what conditions are necessary for it. This report describes the structure and initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model. Overall, we find that the evidence is against 2024 LLMs being conscious, but the evidence against 2024 LLMs being conscious is not decisive. The evidence against LLM consciousness is much weaker than the evidence against consciousness in simpler AI systems.</description>

      <title>Between Search and Platform: ChatGPT Under the DSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the applicability of the Digital Services Act (DSA) to ChatGPT, arguing that it should be classified as a hybrid of the two types of hosting services: online search engines and platforms. This requires classifying search engines as hosting services, which we show is appropriate under the DSA, thereby resolving an ambiguity in the legal framework. ChatGPT performs core search functions and stores user-provided inputs and custom GPTs, meeting the definition of hosting service. We compare ChatGPT's systemic risks with those of existing Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) and Platforms (VLOPs), showing that it raises similarly serious concerns regarding illegal content, fundamental rights, democratic integrity, and public health. Now that ChatGPT has reached the 45 million EU user threshold, it should be subject to the most onerous DSA obligations, requiring the assessment and mitigation of risk emanating from both its online search engine- and platform-like characteristics.</description>

      <title>Trademark Search, Artificial Intelligence and the Role of the Private Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost every industry today confronts the potential role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in its future. While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework. This insight has transformative potential for encouraging both innovation and efficiency in trademark law and practice.</description>

      <title>Do VLMs Have a Moral Backbone? A Study on the Fragile Morality of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial efforts toward improving the moral alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear whether their ethical judgments are stable in realistic settings. This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Instrumental and Substitutive Paradigms: Introducing Machine Culture as an Emergent Phenomenon in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scholarship typically characterizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through either an \textit{Instrumental Paradigm} (viewing models as reflections of their developers' culture) or a \textit{Substitutive Paradigm} (viewing models as bilingual proxies that switch cultural frames based on language). This study challenges these anthropomorphic frameworks by proposing \textbf{Machine Culture} as an emergent, distinct phenomenon. We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona. We conclude that LLMs do not simulate human culture but exhibit an emergent Machine Culture -- a probabilistic phenomenon shaped by \textit{superposition} in high-dimensional space and \textit{mode collapse} from safety alignment.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Energy Consumption using Recurrent Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient power grid management, resource allocation, and market stability. Traditional time-series models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies and external factors affecting energy demand. In this study, we propose a forecasting approach based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our methodology integrates historical energy consumption data with external variables, including temperature, humidity, and time-based features. The LSTM model is trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset, and its performance is compared against a conventional feed-forward neural network baseline. Experimental results show that the LSTM model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in providing reliable and precise short-term energy forecasts for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Bowling Online: Accounting for Civil Society Reshaped into Streamlined Photons within a Fiber Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Civil society has been deemed by various scholars, such as Robert D. Putnam, to be a predictor and a cornerstone of a robust and consolidated democracy (Putnam et al., 1993). Putnam highlights in his book Bowling Alone (2000) that American civil society has become weaker: people organize less, and literally, they bowl alone. But what if there is yet another aspect to Putnam's story that has not been fully accounted for, namely the rise of Digital Civil Society (DCS)? Perhaps people in the third decade of the 21st century bowl online. They still organize, mobilize, and care for their civil liberties and democratic institutions; however, the public sphere in which this takes place has shifted online to cyberspace (Bernholz et al., 2013) or to what still needs to be conceptualized, the digital public sphere (DPS), which this article attempts to measure and demarcate.</description>

      <title>The Global Majority in International AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter examines the global governance of artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of the Global AI Divide, focusing on disparities in AI development, innovation, and regulation. It highlights systemic inequities in education, digital infrastructure, and access to decision-making processes, perpetuating a dependency and exclusion cycle for Global Majority countries. The analysis also explores the dominance of Western nations and corporations in shaping AI governance frameworks, which often sideline the unique priorities and contexts of the Global Majority. Additionally, this chapter identifies emerging countertrends, such as national and regional AI strategies, as potential avenues for fostering equity and inclusivity in global AI governance. The chapter concludes with actionable recommendations to democratize AI governance for Majority World countries, emphasizing the importance of systemic reforms, resource redistribution, and meaningful participation. It calls for collaborative action to ensure AI governance becomes a catalyst for shared prosperity, addressing global disparities rather than deepening them.</description>

      <title>Using psychological theory to ground guidelines for the annotation of misogynistic language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting misogynistic hate speech is a difficult algorithmic task. The task is made more difficult when decision criteria for what constitutes misogynistic speech are ungrounded in established literatures in psychology and philosophy, both of which have described in great detail the forms explicit and subtle misogynistic attitudes can take. In particular, the literature on algorithmic detection of misogynistic speech often rely on guidelines that are insufficiently robust or inappropriately justified -- they often fail to include various misogynistic phenomena or misrepresent their importance when they do. As a result, current misogyny detection coding schemes and datasets fail to capture the ways women experience misogyny online. This is of pressing importance: misogyny is on the rise both online and offline. Thus, the scientific community needs to have a systematic, theory informed coding scheme of misogyny detection and a corresponding dataset to train and test models of misogyny detection. To this end, we developed (1) a misogyny annotation guideline scheme informed by theoretical and empirical psychological research, (2) annotated a new dataset achieving substantial inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.68) and (3) present a case study using Large Language Models (LLMs) to compare our coding scheme to a self-described "expert" misogyny annotation scheme in the literature. Our findings indicate that our guideline scheme surpasses the other coding scheme in the classification of misogynistic texts across 3 datasets. Additionally, we find that LLMs struggle to replicate our human annotator labels, attributable in large part to how LLMs reflect mainstream views of misogyny. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs for the purposes of misogyny detection.</description>

      <title>The 17% Gap: Quantifying Epistemic Decay in AI-Assisted Survey Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific writing promises efficiency but risks introducing informational entropy. While "hallucinated papers" are a known artifact, the systematic degradation of valid citation chains remains unquantified. We conducted a forensic audit of 50 recent survey papers in Artificial Intelligence (N=5,514 citations) published between September 2024 and January 2026. We utilized a hybrid verification pipeline combining DOI resolution, Crossref metadata analysis, Semantic Scholar queries, and fuzzy text matching to distinguish between formatting errors ("Sloppiness") and verifiable non-existence ("Phantoms). We detect a persistent 17.0% Phantom Rate -- citations that cannot be resolved to any digital object despite aggressive forensic recovery. Diagnostic categorization reveals three distinct failure modes: pure hallucinations (5.1%), hallucinated identifiers with valid titles (16.4%), and parsing-induced matching failures (78.5%). Longitudinal analysis reveals a flat trend (+0.07 pp/month), suggesting that high-entropy citation practices have stabilized as an endemic feature of the field. The scientific citation graph in AI survey literature exhibits "link rot" at scale. This suggests a mechanism where AI tools act as "lazy research assistants," retrieving correct titles but hallucinating metadata, thereby severing the digital chain of custody required for reproducible science.</description>

      <title>Building a Bridge between the Two Schools: Realizing a Practical Path to Include Literacy-based Skills within the STEM Curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing students as well-rounded professionals is increasingly important for our modern society. Although there is a great consensus that technical and professional ("soft") skills should be developed and intertwined in the core of computer science subjects, there are still few examples of alike teaching methodologies at technical schools. This contribution investigates the integration of technical and professional skills while teaching specialized curricula in computer science. We propose a broadly applicable, step-by-step methodology that connects core technical concepts (e.g., information entropy, network security) with fine arts practices such as music, video production, gaming, and performing arts (e.g., Oxford-style debates). The methodology was applied in several computer science courses at technical universities, where quantitative and qualitative assessments, including student questionnaires and exam scores, showed improved learning outcomes and increased student engagement compared to traditional methods. The results indicate that this art-based integration can effectively bridge the historical divide between the two schools of thought, offering a practical direction for educators. Within this context, we also identify open issues that will guide future research on topics such as instructor engagement, female motivation in technical subjects, and scalability of these approaches.</description>

      <title>Ethical Risk Assessment of the Data Harnessing Process of LLM supported on Consensus of Well-known Multi-Ethical Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in communication, automation, and knowledge generation. However, the ethical implications of LLM development, particularly in data harnessing, remain a critical challenge. Despite widespread discussion about the ethical compliance of LLMs -- especially concerning their data harnessing processes, there remains a notable absence of concrete frameworks to systematically guide or measure the ethical risks involved. In this paper we discuss a potential pathway for building an Ethical Risk Scoring (ERS) system to quantitatively assess the ethical integrity of the data harnessing process for AI systems. This system is based on a set of assessment questions grounded in core ethical principles, which are, in turn, supported by commanding ethical theories. By integrating measurable scoring mechanisms, this approach aims to foster responsible LLM development, balancing technological innovation with ethical accountability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-density, decentralized copyright conflicts triggered by generative AI training require more than ad hoc solutions; they demand structural governance tools. This article argues that representative litigation settlement agreements offer a distinct institutional advantage. Beyond reducing the transaction costs associated with the "tragedy of the anticommons," these agreements generate market-visible evidence, specifically pricing signals and licensing practices, that validate the "potential market" under the fourth factor of fair use. This phenomenon constitutes procedural market-making. Through a comparative analysis of the U.S. Bartz class action settlement, this study reveals a dual motivation: a surface-level drive for risk aversion and remedy locking, and a deeper logic of constructing a training-licensing market. In the context of Chinese law, the feasibility of such agreements depends not on replicating foreign models, but on establishing three interpretive mechanisms: expanding the functional definition of "same category" claims; adopting a hybrid registration/confirmation system for indeterminate class membership; and converting the "consent" requirement under Article 57, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Procedure Law into a workable opt-out right subject to judicial scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Moral Machine Judgment in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly require moral judgment capabilities, yet whether these capabilities scale predictably with model size remains unexplored. We systematically evaluate 75 large language model configurations (0.27B--1000B parameters) using the Moral Machine framework, measuring alignment with human preferences in life-death dilemmas. We observe a consistent power-law relationship with distance from human preferences ($D$) decreasing as $D \propto S^{-0.10\pm0.01}$ ($R^2=0.50$, $p&lt;0.001$) where $S$ is model size. Mixed-effects models confirm this relationship persists after controlling for model family and reasoning capabilities. Extended reasoning models show additional 16\% improvement beyond scale effects. The relationship holds across diverse architectures, while variance decreases at larger scales, indicating systematic emergence of more reliable moral judgment with computational scale. These findings extend scaling law research to value-based judgments and provide empirical foundations for artificial intelligence governance.</description>

      <title>Predicting Juror Predisposition Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Human and Algorithmic Jury Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior studies on the effectiveness of professional jury consultants in predicting juror proclivities have yielded mixed results, and few have rigorously evaluated consultant performance against chance under controlled conditions. This study addresses that gap by empirically assessing whether jury consultants can reliably predict juror predispositions beyond chance levels and whether supervised machine-learning (ML) models can outperform consultant predictions. Using data from N mock jurors who completed pre-trial attitudinal questionnaires and rendered verdicts in a standardized wrongful-termination case, we compared predictions made by professional jury consultants with those generated by Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers. Model and consultant predictions were evaluated on a held-out test set using paired statistical tests and nonparametric bootstrap procedures. We find that supervised ML models significantly outperform professional jury consultants under identical informational constraints, while offering greater transparency, replicability, and auditability. These results provide an empirical benchmark for evaluating human judgment in jury selection and inform ongoing debates about the role of data-driven decision support in legal contexts. To support reproducibility and auditability, all code and data will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Comparative Algorithmic Governance of Public Health Instruments across India, EU, US and LMICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the juridico-technological architecture of international public health instruments, focusing on their implementation across India, the European Union, the United States and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses a research lacuna: the insufficient harmonisation between normative health law and algorithmic public health infrastructures in resource-constrained jurisdictions. The principal objective is to assess how artificial intelligence augments implementation of instruments grounded in IHR 2005 and the WHO FCTC while identifying doctrinal and infrastructural bottlenecks. Using comparative doctrinal analysis and legal-normative mapping, the study triangulates legislative instruments, WHO monitoring frameworks, AI systems including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu and EIOS, and compliance metrics. Preliminary results show that AI has improved early detection, surveillance precision and responsiveness in high-capacity jurisdictions, whereas LMICs face infrastructural deficits, data privacy gaps and fragmented legal scaffolding. The findings highlight the relevance of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and GDPR as regulatory prototypes for health-oriented algorithmic governance and contrast them with embryonic AI integration and limited internet penetration in many LMICs. The study argues for embedding AI within a rights-compliant, supranationally coordinated regulatory framework to secure equitable health outcomes and stronger compliance. It proposes a model for algorithmic treaty-making inspired by FCTC architecture and calls for WHO-led compliance mechanisms modelled on the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to enhance pandemic preparedness, surveillance equity and transnational governance resilience.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property Rights: Comparative Transnational Policy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence's rapid integration with intellectual property rights necessitates assessment of its impact on trade secrets, copyrights and patents. This study addresses lacunae in existing laws where India lacks AI-specific provisions, creating doctrinal inconsistencies and enforcement inefficacies. Global discourse on AI-IPR protections remains nascent. The research identifies gaps in Indian IP laws' adaptability to AI-generated outputs: trade secret protection is inadequate against AI threats; standardized inventorship criteria are absent. Employing doctrinal and comparative methodology, it scrutinizes legislative texts, judicial precedents and policy instruments across India, US, UK and EU. Preliminary findings reveal shortcomings: India's contract law creates fragmented trade secret regime; Section 3(k) of Indian Patents Act blocks AI invention patenting; copyright varies in authorship attribution. The study proposes harmonized legal taxonomy accommodating AI's role while preserving innovation incentives. India's National AI Strategy (2024) shows progress but legislative clarity is imperative. This contributes to global discourse with AI-specific IP protections ensuring resilience and equitable innovation. Promising results underscore recalibrating India's IP jurisprudence for global alignment.</description>

      <title>"Lighting The Way For Those Not Here": How Technology Researchers Can Help Fight the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives (MMIR) Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island (North America) face disproportionate rates of disappearance and murder, a "genocide" rooted in settler-colonial violence and systemic erasure. Technology plays a crucial role in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives (MMIR) crisis: perpetuating harm and impeding investigations, yet enabling advocacy and resistance. Communities utilize technologies such as AMBER alerts, news websites, social media groups, and campaigns (like #MMIW, #MMIWR, #NoMoreStolenSisters, and #NoMoreStolenDaughters) to mobilize searches, amplify awareness, and honor missing relatives. Yet, little research in HCI has critically examined technology's role in shaping the MMIR crisis by centering community voices. Through a large-scale study, we analyze 140 webpages to identify systemic, technological, and institutional barriers that hinder communities' efforts, while highlighting socio-technical actions that foster healing and safety. Finally, we amplify Indigenous voices by providing a dataset of stories that resist epistemic erasure, along with recommendations for HCI researchers to support Indigenous-led initiatives with cultural sensitivity, accountability, and self-determination.</description>

      <title>The Limits of AI Data Transparency Policy: Three Disclosure Fallacies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data transparency has emerged as a rallying cry for addressing concerns about AI: data quality, privacy, and copyright chief among them. Yet while these calls are crucial for accountability, current transparency policies often fall short of their intended aims. Similar to nutrition facts for food, policies aimed at nutrition facts for AI currently suffer from a limited consideration of research on effective disclosures. We offer an institutional perspective and identify three common fallacies in policy implementations of data disclosures for AI. First, many data transparency proposals exhibit a specification gap between the stated goals of data transparency and the actual disclosures necessary to achieve such goals. Second, reform attempts exhibit an enforcement gap between required disclosures on paper and enforcement to ensure compliance in fact. Third, policy proposals manifest an impact gap between disclosed information and meaningful changes in developer practices and public understanding. Informed by the social science on transparency, our analysis identifies affirmative paths for transparency that are effective rather than merely symbolic.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise Comparisons: A Distributional Test of Distinctiveness for Machine-Generated Works in Intellectual Property Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key doctrines, including novelty (patent), originality (copyright), and distinctiveness (trademark), turn on a shared empirical question: whether a body of work is meaningfully distinct from a relevant reference class. Yet analyses typically operationalize this set-level inquiry using item-level evidence: pairwise comparisons among exemplars. That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in Saudi Arabia: A National Survey of Adoption, Risks, and Public Perceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly becoming embedded in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation under Vision 2030, yet public awareness, adoption, and concerns surrounding these tools remain underexplored. This study provides an early snapshot of GenAI engagement among Saudi nationals. Using a nationwide survey of 330 participants across regions, age groups, and employment sectors, we examine seven dimensions of GenAI use: awareness and understanding, adoption patterns, perceived impacts, training needs, risks and barriers, data-sharing behaviors, and future expectations. Findings show that 93% of respondents actively use GenAI primarily for text-based tasks, while more advanced uses such as programming or multimodal generation are less common. Despite the prevalence of use, overall awareness and conceptual understanding remain uneven, with many reporting limited technical knowledge. Participants recognize GenAI's benefits for productivity, work quality, and understanding complex information, yet caution that sustained reliance may undermine critical thinking and key professional skills. Trust in AI-generated outputs remains cautious, with widespread concerns about privacy, misinformation, and ethical misuse, including potential job displacement. Respondents show strong interest in structured GenAI training that combines foundational skills, domain-specific applications, and clear guidance on privacy, ethics, and responsible use. These results establish a baseline for GenAI engagement in Saudi Arabia and highlight priorities for policymakers and developers: expanding AI literacy, ensuring culturally and linguistically aligned GenAI solutions, and strengthening frameworks for privacy and responsible deployment.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Checkbox: Strengthening DSA Compliance Through Social Media Algorithmic Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms of online platforms are required under the Digital Services Act (DSA) to comply with specific obligations concerning algorithmic transparency, user protection and privacy. To verify compliance with these requirements, DSA mandates platforms to undergo independent audits. Little is known about current auditing practices and their effectiveness in ensuring such compliance. To this end, we bridge regulatory and technical perspectives by critically examining selected audit reports across three critical algorithmic-related provisions: restrictions on profiling minors, transparency in recommender systems, and limitations on targeted advertising using sensitive data. Our analysis shows significant inconsistencies in methodologies and lack of technical depth when evaluating AI-powered systems. To enhance the depth, scale, and independence of compliance assessments, we propose to employ algorithmic auditing -- a process of behavioural assessment of AI algorithms by means of simulating user behaviour, observing algorithm responses and analysing them for audited phenomena.</description>

      <title>Rethinking AI in the age of climate collapse: Ethics, power, and responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climate crisis requires responses that integrate scientific, ethical, social, and technological perspectives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in climate modelling, environmental monitoring, and energy optimisation, yet its growing use also raises critical environmental, ethical, legal, and social questions. This contribution examines the ambivalent role of AI in the ecological crisis, addressing both its promises and its risks. On the one hand, AI supports improvements in climate forecasting, renewable energy management, and real-time detection of environmental degradation. On the other hand, the energy demands of data centres, resource-intensive hardware production, algorithmic bias, corporate concentration of power, and technocratic decision-making reveal contradictions that challenge its sustainability. The discussion explores these issues through interdisciplinary lenses, including environmental ethics, philosophy of technology, and legal governance, and concludes with recommendations for socially just, ecologically responsible, and democratically accountable uses of AI. Rather than assuming AI as an inherently sustainable solution, this analysis argues that its contribution to climate action depends fundamentally on the values, institutions, and power structures that shape its development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Brazil has experienced a decline in vaccination coverage, reversing decades of public health progress achieved through the National Immunization Program (PNI). Growing evidence points to the widespread circulation of vaccine-related misinformation -- particularly on social media platforms -- as a key factor driving this decline. Among these platforms, Telegram remains the only major platform permitting accessible and ethical data collection, offering insight into public channels where vaccine misinformation circulates extensively. This data paper introduces a curated dataset of about four million Telegram posts collected from 119 prominent Brazilian anti-vaccine channels between 2020 and 2025. The dataset includes message content, metadata, associated media, and classification related to vaccine posts, enabling researchers to examine how false or misleading information spreads, evolves, and influences public sentiment. By providing this resource, our aim is to support the scientific and public health community in developing evidence-based strategies to counter misinformation, promote trust in vaccination, and engage compassionately with individuals and communities affected by false narratives. The dataset and documentation are openly available for non-commercial research, under strict ethical and privacy guidelines at https://doi.org/10.25824/redu/5JIVDT</description>

      <title>Digital Euro: Frequently Asked Questions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Central Bank (ECB) is working on the "digital euro", an envisioned retail central bank digital currency for the Euro area. In this article, we take a closer look at the "digital euro FAQ", which provides answers to 26 frequently asked questions about the digital euro, and other published documents by the ECB on the topic. We question the provided answers based on our analysis of the current design in terms of privacy, technical feasibility, risks, costs and utility. In particular, we discuss the following key findings:
  (KF1) Central monitoring of all online digital euro transactions by the ECB threatens privacy even more than contemporary digital payment methods with segregated account databases.
  (KF2) The ECB's envisioned concept of a secure offline version of the digital euro offering full anonymity is in strong conflict with the actual history of hardware security breaches and mathematical evidence against it.
  (KF3) The legal and financial liabilities for the various parties involved remain unclear.
  (KF4) The design lacks well-specified economic incentives for operators as well as a discussion of its economic impact on merchants.
  (KF5) The ECB fails to identify tangible benefits the digital euro would create for society, in particular given that the online component of the proposed infrastructure mainly duplicates existing payment systems.
  (KF6) The design process has been exclusionary, with critical decisions being set in stone before public consultations. Alternative and open design ideas have not even been discussed by the ECB.</description>

      <title>When Is Self-Disclosure Optimal? Incentives and Governance of AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) is reshaping content creation on digital platforms by reducing production costs and enabling scalable output of varying quality. In response, platforms have begun adopting disclosure policies that require creators to label AI-generated content, often supported by imperfect detection and penalties for non-compliance. This paper develops a formal model to study the economic implications of such disclosure regimes. We compare a non-disclosure benchmark, in which the platform alone detects AI usage, with a mandatory self-disclosure regime in which creators strategically choose whether to disclose or conceal AI use under imperfect enforcement. The model incorporates heterogeneous creators, viewer discounting of AI-labeled content, trust penalties following detected non-disclosure, and endogenous enforcement. The analysis shows that disclosure is optimal only when both the value of AI-generated content and its cost-saving advantage are intermediate. As AI capability improves, the platform's optimal enforcement strategy evolves from strict deterrence to partial screening and eventual deregulation. While disclosure reliably increases transparency, it reduces aggregate creator surplus and can suppress high-quality AI content when AI is technologically advanced. Overall, the results characterize disclosure as a strategic governance instrument whose effectiveness depends on technological maturity and trust frictions.</description>

      <title>AI-based System for Transforming text and sound to Educational Videos</title>

Abstract: Technological developments have produced methods that can generate educational videos from input text or sound. Recently, the use of deep learning techniques for image and video generation has been widely explored, particularly in education. However, generating video content from conditional inputs such as text or speech remains a challenging area. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to the educational structure, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which develop frame-for-frame frameworks and are able to create full educational videos. The proposed system is structured into three main phases In the first phase, the input (either text or speech) is transcribed using speech recognition. In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video. The proposed system is compared with other systems such as TGAN, MoCoGAN, and TGANS-C, achieving a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 28.75%, which indicates improved visual quality and better over existing methods.</description>

      <title>LLM-Generated or Human-Written? Comparing Review and Non-Review Papers on ArXiv</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ArXiv recently prohibited the upload of unpublished review papers to its servers in the Computer Science domain, citing a high prevalence of LLM-generated content in these categories. However, this decision was not accompanied by quantitative evidence. In this work, we investigate this claim by measuring the proportion of LLM-generated content in review vs. non-review research papers in recent years. Using two high-quality detection methods, we find a substantial increase in LLM-generated content across both review and non-review papers, with a higher prevalence in review papers. However, when considering the number of LLM-generated papers published in each category, the estimates of non-review LLM-generated papers are almost six times higher. Furthermore, we find that this policy will affect papers in certain domains far more than others, with the CS subdiscipline Computers &amp; Society potentially facing cuts of 50%. Our analysis provides an evidence-based framework for evaluating such policy decisions, and we release our code to facilitate future investigations at: https://github.com/yanaiela/llm-review-arxiv.</description>

      <title>ThinkTank-ME: A Multi-Expert Framework for Middle East Event Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event forecasting is inherently influenced by multifaceted considerations, including international relations, regional historical dynamics, and cultural contexts. However, existing LLM-based approaches employ single-model architectures that generate predictions along a singular explicit trajectory, constraining their ability to capture diverse geopolitical nuances across complex regional contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce ThinkTank-ME, a novel Think Tank framework for Middle East event forecasting that emulates collaborative expert analysis in real-world strategic decision-making. To facilitate expert specialization and rigorous evaluation, we construct POLECAT-FOR-ME, a Middle East-focused event forecasting benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of multi-expert collaboration in handling complex temporal geopolitical forecasting tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/LuminosityX/ThinkTank-ME.</description>

      <title>Lost in Simulation: LLM-Simulated Users are Unreliable Proxies for Human Users in Agentic Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic benchmarks increasingly rely on LLM-simulated users to scalably evaluate agent performance, yet the robustness, validity, and fairness of this approach remain unexamined. Through a user study with participants across the United States, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, we investigate whether LLM-simulated users serve as reliable proxies for real human users in evaluating agents on {\tau}-Bench retail tasks. We find that user simulation lacks robustness, with agent success rates varying up to 9 percentage points across different user LLMs. Furthermore, evaluations using simulated users exhibit systematic miscalibration, underestimating agent performance on challenging tasks and overestimating it on moderately difficult ones. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers experience consistently worse success rates and calibration errors than Standard American English (SAE) speakers, with disparities compounding significantly with age. We also find simulated users to be a differentially effective proxy for different populations, performing worst for AAVE and Indian English speakers. Additionally, simulated users introduce conversational artifacts and surface different failure patterns than human users. These findings demonstrate that current evaluation practices risk misrepresenting agent capabilities across diverse user populations and may obscure real-world deployment challenges.</description>

      <title>Falsifying Predictive Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical investigations into unintended model behavior often show that the algorithm is predicting another outcome than what was intended. These exposes highlight the need to identify when algorithms predict unintended quantities - ideally before deploying them into consequential settings. We propose a falsification framework that provides a principled statistical test for discriminant validity: the requirement that an algorithm predict intended outcomes better than impermissible ones. Drawing on falsification practices from causal inference, econometrics, and psychometrics, our framework compares calibrated prediction losses across outcomes to assess whether the algorithm exhibits discriminant validity with respect to a specified impermissible proxy. In settings where the target outcome is difficult to observe, multiple permissible proxy outcomes may be available; our framework accommodates both this setting and the case with a single permissible proxy. Throughout we use nonparametric hypothesis testing methods that make minimal assumptions on the data-generating process. We illustrate the method in an admissions setting, where the framework establishes discriminant validity with respect to gender but fails to establish discriminant validity with respect to race. This demonstrates how falsification can serve as an early validity check, prior to fairness or robustness analyses. We also provide analysis in a criminal justice setting, where we highlight the limitations of our framework and emphasize the need for complementary approaches to assess other aspects of construct validity and external validity.</description>

      <title>Who Gets Which Message? Auditing Demographic Bias in LLM-Generated Targeted Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating personalized, persuasive text at scale, raising new questions about bias and fairness in automated communication. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of how LLMs behave when tasked with demographic-conditioned targeted messaging. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>CTF for education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a close look at how CTF can be used in cybersecurity education. We divide the CTF competitions into four different categories, which are attack-based CTFs, defense-based CTFs, jeopardy CTFs and gamified and wargames CTFs.
  We start our analysis by summarizing the main characteristics of different CTF types. We then compare them with each other in both learning objectives and other aspects like accessibility. We conclude that combining all four CTF formats can help participants build one's cybersecurity knowledge.
  By doing that, we hope that our findings will provide some useful insights for future CTF educators.</description>

      <title>When Nobody Around Is Real: Exploring Public Opinions and User Experiences On the Multi-Agent AI Social Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powered by large language models, a new genre of multi-agent social platforms has emerged. Apps such as Social.AI deploy numerous AI agents that emulate human behavior, creating unprecedented bot-centric social networks. Yet, existing research has predominantly focused on one-on-one chatbots, leaving multi-agent AI platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we took Social.AI as a case study and performed a two-stage investigation: (i) content analysis of 883 user comments; (ii) a 7-day diary study with 20 participants to document their firsthand platform experiences. While public discourse expressed greater skepticism, the diary study found that users did project a range of social expectations onto the AI agents. While some user expectations were met, the AI-dominant social environment introduces distinct problems, such as attention overload and homogenized interaction. These tensions signal a future where AI functions not merely as a tool or an anthropomorphized actor, but as the dominant medium of sociality itself-a paradigm shift that foregrounds new forms of architected social life.</description>

      <title>Corpus-Based Approaches to Igbo Diacritic Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With natural language processing (NLP), researchers aim to enable computers to identify and understand patterns in human languages. This is often difficult because a language embeds many dynamic and varied properties in its syntax, pragmatics and phonology, which need to be captured and processed. The capacity of computers to process natural languages is increasing because NLP researchers are pushing its boundaries. But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.
  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants. For the classification models, a window of words on both sides of the target stripped word was used. The embedding models compare the similarity scores of the combined context word embeddings and the embeddings of each of the candidate variant vectors.</description>

      <title>Demographic Probing of Large Language Models Lacks Construct Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demographic probing is widely used to study how large language models (LLMs) adapt their behavior to signaled demographic attributes. This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Unheard in the Digital Age: Rethinking AI Bias and Speech Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech remains one of the most visible yet overlooked vectors of inclusion and exclusion in contemporary society. While fluency is often equated with credibility and competence, individuals with atypical speech patterns are routinely marginalized. Given the current state of the debate, this article focuses on the structural biases that shape perceptions of atypical speech and are now being encoded into artificial intelligence. Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems and voice interfaces, trained predominantly on standardized speech, routinely fail to recognize or respond to diverse voices, compounding digital exclusion. As AI technologies increasingly mediate access to opportunity, the study calls for inclusive technological design, anti-bias training to minimize the impact of discriminatory algorithmic decisions, and enforceable policy reform that explicitly recognize speech diversity as a matter of equity, not merely accessibility. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, the article advocates for a cultural and institutional shift in how we value voice, urging co-created solutions that elevate the rights, representation, and realities of atypical speakers in the digital age. Ultimately, the article reframes speech inclusion as a matter of equity (not accommodation) and advocates for co-created AI systems that reflect the full spectrum of human voices.</description>

Abstract: Previous discussions have highlighted the need for generative AI tools to become more culturally sensitive, yet often neglect the complexities of handling content about minorities, who are perceived differently across cultures and religions. Our study examined how two generative AI systems respond to homophobic statements with varying cultural and religious context information. Findings showed ChatGPT 3.5's replies exhibited cultural relativism, in contrast to Bard's, which stressed human rights and provided more support for LGBTQ+ issues. Both demonstrated significant change in responses based on contextual information provided in the prompts, suggesting that AI systems may adjust in their responses the degree and forms of support for LGBTQ+ people according to information they receive about the user's background. The study contributes to understanding the social and ethical implications of AI responses and argues that any work to make generative AI outputs more culturally diverse requires a grounding in fundamental human rights.

      <title>LLMs and Childhood Safety: Identifying Risks and Proposing a Protection Framework for Safe Child-LLM Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11242v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in child-facing contexts such as education, companionship, creative tools, but their deployment raises safety, privacy, developmental, and security risks. We conduct a systematic literature review of child-LLM interaction risks and organize findings into a structured map that separates (i) parent-reported concerns, (ii) empirically documented harms, and (iii) gaps between perceived and observed risk. Moving beyond descriptive listing, we compare how different evidence streams in surveys, incident reports, youth interaction logs, and governance guidance operationalize "harm," where they conflict, and what mitigations they imply. Based on this synthesis, we propose a protection framework that couples child-specific content safety and developmental sensitivity with security-grade controls for adversarial misuse, including prompt injection and multimodal jailbreak pathways. The framework specifies measurable evaluation targets (e.g., harmful-content avoidance, age-calibrated readability, bias parity checks, prompt-injection robustness, and monitoring transparency) to support developers, educators, and policymakers in assessing and improving child-safe LLM deployments.</description>

      <title>Interleaving Natural Language Prompting with Code Editing for Solving Programming Tasks with Generative AI Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day lab activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop: An Instructor-in-the-Loop AI Assistance System for Supporting Student Help-Seeking in Programming Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely and high-quality feedback is essential for effective learning in programming courses; yet, providing such support at scale remains a challenge. While AI-based systems offer scalable and immediate help, their responses can occasionally be inaccurate or insufficient. Human instructors, in contrast, may bring more valuable expertise but are limited in time and availability. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid help framework that integrates AI-generated hints with an escalation mechanism, allowing students to request feedback from instructors when AI support falls short. This design leverages the strengths of AI for scale and responsiveness while reserving instructor effort for moments of greatest need. We deployed this tool in a data science programming course with 82 students. We observe that out of the total 673 AI-generated hints, students rated 146 (22%) as unhelpful. Among those, only 16 (11%) of the cases were escalated to the instructors. A qualitative investigation of instructor responses showed that those feedback instances were incorrect or insufficient roughly half of the time. This finding suggests that when AI support fails, even instructors with expertise may need to pay greater attention to avoid making mistakes. We will publicly release the tool for broader adoption and enable further studies in other classrooms. Our work contributes a practical approach to scaling high-quality support and informs future efforts to effectively integrate AI and humans in education.</description>

      <title>Teaching Quantum Computing through Lab-Integrated Learning: Bridging Conceptual and Computational Understanding</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing education requires students to move beyond classical programming intuitions related to state, determinism, and debugging, and to develop reasoning skills grounded in probability, measurement, and interference. This paper reports on the design and delivery of a combined undergraduate and graduate course at Louisiana State University that employed a lab-integrated learning model to support conceptual change and progressive understanding. The course paired lectures with weekly programming labs that served as environments for experimentation and reflection. These labs enabled students to confront misconceptions and refine their mental models through direct observation and evidence-based reasoning. Instruction began with Quantum Without Linear Algebra (QWLA), which introduced core concepts such as superposition and entanglement through intuitive, dictionary representations. The course then transitioned to IBM Qiskit, which provided a professional framework for circuit design, noise simulation, and algorithm implementation. Analysis of student work and feedback indicated that hands-on experimentation improved confidence, conceptual clarity, and fluency across representations. At the same time, it revealed persistent challenges in debugging, reasoning about measurement, and understanding probabilistic outcomes. This paper presents the course structure, instructional strategies, and lessons learned, and argues that lab-integrated learning offers an effective and accessible approach to teaching quantum computing in computer science education.</description>

      <title>The Imperfect Learner: Incorporating Developmental Trajectories in Memory-based Student Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User simulation is important for developing and evaluating human-centered AI, yet current student simulation in educational applications has significant limitations. Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</description>

      <title>Internal Deployment in the EU AI Act</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This memorandum analyzes and stress-tests arguments in favor and against the inclusion of internal deployment within the scope of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). In doing so, it aims to offer several possible interpretative pathways to the European Commission, AI providers and deployers, courts, and the legal and policy community at large based on Articles 2(1), 2(6), 2(8) of the EU AI Act. Specifically, this memorandum first analyzes four interpretative pathways based on Article 2(1)(a)-(c) supporting the application of the EU AI Act to internally deployed AI models and systems. Then, it examines possible objections and exceptions based on Articles 2(1)(a), 2(6), and 2(8), with particular attention to the complexity of the scientific R&amp;D exception under Article 2(6). Finally, it illustrates how Articles 2(1), 2(6), and 2(8) can be viewed as complementary to each other, once broken down to their most plausible meaning and interpreted in conjunction with Articles 3(1), 3(3), 3(4), 3(9), 3(10), 3(11), 3(12), 3(63), and Recitals 12, 13, 21, 25, 97, 109, and 110.</description>

      <title>Modeling Collaborative Problem Solving Dynamics from Group Discourse: A Text-Mining Approach with Synergy Degree Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring collaborative problem solving (CPS) synergy remains challenging in learning analytics, as classical manual coding cannot capture emergent system-level dynamics. This study introduces a computational framework that integrates automated discourse analysis with the Synergy Degree Model (SDM) to quantify CPS synergy from group communication. Data were collected from 52 learners in 12 groups during a 5-week connectivist MOOC (cMOOC) activity. Nine classification models were applied to automatically identify ten CPS behaviors across four interaction levels: operation, wayfinding, sense-making, and creation. While BERT achieved the highest accuracy, GPT models demonstrated superior precision suitable for human-AI collaborative coding. Within the SDM framework, each interaction level was treated as a subsystem to compute group-level order parameters and derive synergy degrees. Permutation tests showed automated measures preserve construct validity, despite systematic biases at the subsystem level. Statistical analyses revealed significant task-type differences: survey study groups exhibited higher creation-order than mode study groups, suggesting "controlled disorder" may benefit complex problem solving. Importantly, synergy degree distinguished collaborative quality, ranging from excellent to failing groups. Findings establish synergy degree as a sensitive indicator of collaboration and demonstrate the feasibility of scaling fine-grained CPS analytics through AI-in-the-loop approaches.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Effects on Accuracy and Fairness among Similar Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that degrade both predictive accuracy and individual fairness, posing critical risks in high-stakes online decision-making. The relationship between these two dimensions of robustness remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce robust individual fairness (RIF), which requires that similar individuals receive predictions consistent with the same ground truth even under adversarial manipulation. To evaluate and expose violations of RIF, we propose RIFair, an attack framework that applies identical perturbations to similar individuals to induce accuracy or fairness failures. We further introduce perturbation impact index (PII) and perturbation impact direction (PID) to quantify and explain why identical perturbations produce unequal effects on individuals who should behave similarly. Experiments across diverse model architectures and real-world web datasets reveal that existing robustness metrics capture distinct and often incompatible failure modes in accuracy and fairness. We find that many online applicants are simultaneously vulnerable to multiple types of adversarial failures, and that inaccurate or unfair outcomes arise due to similar individuals share the same PID but have sharply different PIIs, leading to divergent prediction-change trajectories in which some cross decision boundaries earlier. Finally, we demonstrate that adversarial examples generated by RIFair can strategically manipulate test-set accuracy or fairness by replacing only a small subset of items, creating misleading impressions of model performance. These findings expose fundamental limitations in current robustness evaluations and highlight the need for jointly assessing accuracy and fairness under adversarial perturbations in high-stakes online decision-making.</description>

      <title>JiraiBench: A Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models' Detection of Human Self-Destructive Behavior Content in Jirai Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces JiraiBench, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating large language models' effectiveness in detecting self-destructive content across Chinese and Japanese social media communities. Focusing on the transnational "Jirai" (landmine) online subculture that encompasses multiple forms of self-destructive behaviors including drug overdose, eating disorders, and self-harm, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework incorporating both linguistic and cultural dimensions. Our dataset comprises 10,419 Chinese posts and 5,000 Japanese posts with multidimensional annotation along three behavioral categories, achieving substantial inter-annotator agreement. Experimental evaluations across four state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance variations based on instructional language, with Japanese prompts unexpectedly outperforming Chinese prompts when processing Chinese content. This emergent cross-cultural transfer suggests that cultural proximity can sometimes outweigh linguistic similarity in detection tasks. Cross-lingual transfer experiments with fine-tuned models further demonstrate the potential for knowledge transfer between these language systems without explicit target language training. These findings highlight the need for culturally-informed approaches to multilingual content moderation and provide empirical evidence for the importance of cultural context in developing more effective detection systems for vulnerable online communities.</description>

Abstract: The primary goal of this study is to analyze agentic workflows in education according to the proposed four major technological paradigms: reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration. We critically examine the role of AI agents in education through these key design paradigms, exploring their advantages, applications, and challenges. Second, to illustrate the practical potential of agentic systems, we present a proof-of-concept application: a multi-agent framework for automated essay scoring. Preliminary results suggest this agentic approach may offer improved consistency compared to stand-alone LLMs. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of AI agents in educational settings while underscoring the need for further research into their interpretability and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Rhetorical XAI: Explaining AI's Benefits as well as its Use via Rhetorical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore potential benefits of incorporating Rhetorical Design into the design of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations may also function as rhetorical arguments that shape how users evaluate a system's usefulness and credibility, and how they develop appropriate trust for adoption. In real-world, in-situ interactions, explanations can thus produce experiential and affective rhetorical effects that are not fully captured by traditional XAI design goals that focus primarily on how AI works. To address this gap, we propose Rhetorical XAI, which bridges two explanatory goals: how AI works and why AI merits use. Rhetorical XAI comprises three appeals in explanation design: logos, which aligns technical logic with human reasoning through visual and textual abstractions; ethos, which establishes contextual credibility based on the explanation source and its appropriateness to the decision task; and pathos, which engages user emotionally by framing explanations around their motivations, expectations, or situated needs during interaction. We conduct a narrative review synthesizing design strategies from prior XAI work aligned with these three rhetorical appeals, highlighting both opportunities and challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI.</description>

      <title>Understanding Teen Overreliance on AI Companion Chatbots Through Self-Reported Reddit Narratives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI companion chatbots are increasingly popular with teens. While these interactions are entertaining, they also risk overuse that can potentially disrupt offline daily life. We examined how adolescents describe reliance on AI companions, mapping their experiences onto behavioral addiction frameworks and exploring pathways to disengagement, by analyzing 318 Reddit posts made by users who self-disclosed as 13-17 years old on the Character.AI subreddit. We found teens often begin using chatbots for support or creative play, but these activities can deepen into strong attachments marked by conflict, withdrawal, tolerance, relapse, and mood regulation. Reported consequences include sleep loss, academic decline, and strained real-world connections. Disengagement commonly arises when teens recognize harm, re-engage with offline life, or encounter restrictive platform changes. We highlight specific risks of character-based companion chatbots based on teens' perspectives and introduce a design framework (CARE) for guidance for safer systems and setting directions for future teen-centered research.</description>

      <title>Labels or Input? Rethinking Augmentation in Multimodal Hate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online hate remains a significant societal challenge, especially as multimodal content enables subtle, culturally grounded, and implicit forms of harm. Hateful memes embed hostility through text-image interactions and humor, making them difficult for automated systems to interpret. Although recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on explicit cases, their deployment is limited by high inference costs and persistent failures on nuanced content. This work examines how far small models can be improved through prompt optimization, fine-tuning, and automated data augmentation. We introduce an end-to-end pipeline that varies prompt structure, label granularity, and training modality, showing that structured prompts and scaled supervision significantly strengthen compact VLMs. We also develop a multimodal augmentation framework that generates counterfactually neutral memes via a coordinated LLM-VLM setup, reducing spurious correlations and improving the detection of implicit hate. Ablation studies quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that prompt design, granular labels, and targeted augmentation collectively narrow the gap between small and large models. The results offer a practical path toward more robust and deployable multimodal hate-detection systems without relying on costly large-model inference.</description>

      <title>Can GenAI Move from Individual Use to Collaborative Work? Experiences, Challenges, and Opportunities of Coordinating GenAI into Collaborative Newswork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping work, but adoption remains largely individual and experimental rather than coordinated into collaborative work. Whether GenAI can move from individual use to collaborative work is a critical question for future organizations. Journalism offers a compelling site to examine this shift: individual journalists have already been disrupted by GenAI tools; yet newswork is inherently collaborative relying on shared norms and coordinated workflows. We conducted 27 interviews with newsroom managers, editors and front-line journalists in China. We found that journalists frequently used GenAI to support daily tasks, but value alignment was safeguarded mainly through individual discretion. At the organizational level, GenAI use remained disconnected from team workflows, hindered by structural barriers and cultural reluctance to share practices. These findings underscore the gap between individual and collaborative work, pointing to the need to account for organizational structures, cultural norms, and workflow when coordinating GenAI for collaborative work.</description>

      <title>CoBRA: Programming Cognitive Bias in Social Agents Using Classic Social Science Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional approaches that specify agent behavior through implicit natural-language descriptions often do not yield consistent behavior across models, and the resulting behavior does not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast, CoBRA introduces a model-agnostic way to control agent behavior that lets researchers explicitly specify desired nuances and obtain consistent behavior across models. At the heart of CoBRA is a novel closed-loop system primitive with two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures the demonstrated cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a set of validated classic social science experiments; (2) Behavioral Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to exhibit controlled cognitive bias. Through CoBRA, we show how to operationalize validated social science knowledge (i.e., classical experiments) as reusable "gym" environments for AI -- an approach that may generalize to richer social and affective simulations beyond bias alone.</description>

      <title>The PIMMUR Principles: Ensuring Validity in Collective Behavior of LLM Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to simulate human collective behaviors, yet the methodological rigor of these "AI societies" remains under-explored. Through a systematic audit of 42 recent studies, we identify six pervasive flaws-spanning agent profiles, interaction, memory, control, unawareness, and realism (PIMMUR). Our analysis reveals that 90.7% of studies violate at least one principle, undermining simulation validity. We demonstrate that frontier LLMs correctly identify the underlying social experiment in 47.6% of cases, while 65.3% of prompts exert excessive control that pre-determines outcomes. By reproducing five representative experiments (e.g., telephone game), we show that reported collective phenomena often vanish or reverse when PIMMUR principles are enforced, suggesting that many "emergent" behaviors are methodological artifacts rather than genuine social dynamics. Our findings suggest that current AI simulations may capture model-specific biases rather than universal human social behaviors, raising critical concerns about the use of LLMs as scientific proxies for human society.</description>

      <title>BLEnD-Vis: Benchmarking Multimodal Cultural Understanding in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding. We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset, BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16 regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only baseline querying from Region $\rightarrow$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant (Entity $\rightarrow$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation. BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge; models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing. While visual cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights the challenges of robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly in lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/BLEnD-Vis.</description>

      <title>DSSmoothing: Toward Certified Dataset Ownership Verification for Pre-trained Language Models via Dual-Space Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/DSSmoothing.</description>

      <title>neuralFOMO: Can LLMs Handle Being Second Best? Measuring Envy-Like Preferences in Multi-Agent Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Envy shapes competitiveness and cooperation in human groups, yet its role in large language model interactions remains largely unexplored. As LLMs increasingly operate in multi-agent settings, it is important to examine whether they exhibit envy-like preferences under social comparison. We evaluate LLM behavior across two scenarios: (1) a point-allocation game testing sensitivity to relative versus absolute payoff, and (2) comparative evaluations across general and contextual settings. To ground our analysis in psychological theory, we adapt four established psychometric questionnaires spanning general, domain-specific, workplace, and sibling-based envy. Our results reveal heterogeneous envy-like patterns across models and contexts, with some models sacrificing personal gain to reduce a peer's advantage, while others prioritize individual maximization. These findings highlight competitive dispositions as a design and safety consideration for multi-agent LLM systems.</description>

      <title>The Need for a Socially-Grounded Persona Framework for User Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic personas are widely used to condition large language models (LLMs) for social simulation, yet most personas are still constructed from coarse sociodemographic attributes or summaries. We revisit persona creation by introducing SCOPE, a socially grounded framework for persona construction and evaluation, built from a 141-item, two-hour sociopsychological protocol collected from 124 U.S.-based participants. Across seven models, we find that demographic-only personas are a structural bottleneck: demographics explain only ~1.5% of variance in human response similarity. Adding sociopsychological facets improves behavioral prediction and reduces over-accentuation, and non-demographic personas based on values and identity achieve strong alignment with substantially lower bias. These trends generalize to SimBench (441 aligned questions), where SCOPE personas outperform default prompting and NVIDIA Nemotron personas, and SCOPE augmentation improves Nemotron-based personas. Our results indicate that persona quality depends on sociopsychological structure rather than demographic templates or summaries.</description>

      <title>Not Your Typical Sycophant: The Elusive Nature of Sycophancy in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.</description>
