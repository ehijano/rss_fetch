      <title>Algorithmic Collusion of Pricing and Advertising on E-commerce Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion - the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning, which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products. Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers, and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate such algorithms.</description>

      <title>The economic, social &amp; Environmental impact of Electric Vehicle (EV) adaptation on Bangladeshi Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the economic social and environmental impacts of electric vehicle adoption in Bangladesh using survey data from 57 respondents and secondary research. Findings show strong public perception of electric vehicles as cost effective with ninety three percent agreement and environmentally beneficial with eighty two point five percent agreement. Electric vehicles have potential to reduce fuel imports lower operational costs and create over fifty thousand jobs by 2030. Socially electric vehicles improve mobility for low income groups with seventy five point four percent agreement and increase safety although adoption remains mostly in urban areas. Environmentally electric vehicles could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to thirty percent per kilometre and lower particulate matter levels by twenty to twenty five percent in Dhaka along with a three to five decibel reduction in traffic noise. Main barriers include high purchase costs limited charging infrastructure and low public awareness of policies. Policy recommendations include tax incentives solar powered charging stations and battery recycling regulations. This research concludes that strategic electric vehicle adoption could advance Bangladesh's sustainable transportation economic resilience and public health goals.</description>

      <title>Toward better understanding of energy in economics: Improvements to the Garrett thermodynamic economic model yield a robust system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of papers, Garrett, et al, presents a thermodynamic economic model first laid out in "Are there basic physical constraints on future anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide?". This model contains a key conceptual issue that obscures a robust system. This system can link to the Energy Based Cobb-Douglas equation.
  The key conceptual problem is the belief that $\lambda$, the symbol for growth in Garrett 2011 would disprove the model if it was not constant. However, $\lambda$ cannot be a constant in an economic model, because $\lambda$, with dimension [$\frac{E}{\$ \; GWP}$], represents the aggregate efficiency of all of the more than 359 million firms (and by extension, households) making products globally. To clarify it, I define this aggregate production function distribution as $\Lambda(t) \equiv \sum {\lambda_i(t) \cdot \frac{P_i}{GWP}}$, and with light algebra assign a version of the Energy Based Cobb-Douglas (EBDC) function to $\lambda$.
  There are various falsified speculations in the body of work that appear to mostly follow from the original issue. The 50 year stable relation of $W$ to $E$ is close, but the trend is not flat. The form and degree to which the "long arm of history" speculation may be true remains to be fully considered, but is falsified in the form presented. The speculation in Garrett 2022 that $\frac{dE}{dt}\rightarrow0$ can cause real GDP to go to zero by inflation is falsified. By generating a dataset going back to -14,000 CE, the speculative $W$ curve appears largely confirmed. The $E$ curve is quite far off prior to 1970 back to 1 CE due to overestimation of pre-industrial energy.
  By correcting and improving on the foundation issue of Garrett's yeoman effort, improving $E$ and some equation presentation formalism, a robust thermodynamic model of the global economy emerges that is straightforward and practical.</description>

      <title>Executive Accountability Systems and the Environmental Violations of State-Owned Enterprises in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executive accountability is increasingly viewed as a critical mechanism for improving corporate environmental performance, especially in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that dominate high-emission sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and heavy industry. This study examines whether China's Accountability System for Irregular Operations and Investments (ASIOI) curbs environmental violations in SOEs. Exploiting the staggered regional implementation of ASIOI as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that the policy leads to a significant reduction in SOE environmental misconduct. Drawing on a criminology-based cost-benefit framework, we identify three underlying mechanisms: strengthened internal controls, increased green investment, and enhanced green innovation. Further analyses reveal that the deterrent effect of ASIOI is more pronounced in SOEs that exhibit weaker regulatory oversight and stronger incentives to commit violations. By focusing on politically embedded SOEs, this study shows how accountability mechanisms can catalyze proactive green transformation, enhancing the strategic role of public governance in sustainability transitions.</description>

      <title>The impact of the European Union's enlargement with the Western Balkans and the Association Trio on the power of member states in the Council</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of 2022, the European Union has taken several steps regarding enlargement. We focus on the accession of countries with which the Union is actively negotiating membership. This is examined under two enlargement scenarios: first, the enlargement along the lines of the Western Balkan countries, and second, the accession of a trio (Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia) to the already enlarged Union. We determine the a priori power of the member states based on the Banzhaf and Shapley--Shubik indices. Various coalitions are also assumed to assess the power and influence of member states, considering both pre- and post-enlargement scenarios. We found a rare case when the two indices give different rankings. In the case of the Western Balkan countries' accession, the smaller population member states gain power, presenting an example of the new member paradox. While in a Union of 36 members, every member state loses some of their current power. However, some coalitions are better off with the EU36 enlargement than a EU33 one.</description>

      <title>The shape of economics before and after the financial crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the global financial crisis on the shape of economics as a discipline by analyzing EconLit-indexed journals from 2006 to 2020 using a multilayer network approach. We consider two types of social relationships among journals, based on shared editors (interlocking editorship) and shared authors (interlocking authorship), as well as two forms of intellectual proximity, derived from bibliographic coupling and textual similarity. These four dimensions are integrated using Similarity Network Fusion to produce a unified similarity network from which journal communities are identified. Comparing the field in 2006, 2012, and 2019 reveals a high degree of structural continuity. Our findings suggest that, despite changes in research topics after the crisis, fundamental social and intellectual relationships among journals have remained remarkably stable. Editorial networks, in particular, continue to shape hierarchies and legitimize knowledge production.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs and Comparison Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of how tradeoffs govern the difficulty of comparisons. In our model, options are easier to compare when they involve less pronounced tradeoffs -- when they are 1) more similar feature-by-feature and 2) closer to dominance. These postulates yield tractable measures of comparison complexity in three domains: multiattribute, lottery, and intertemporal choice. Our model rationalizes multiple behavioral regularities, such as context effects, preference reversals, and apparent probability weighting and hyperbolic discounting. In choice data spanning all three domains, our model predicts errors, inconsistency, and cognitive uncertainty. Manipulating tradeoffs reverses classic behavioral regularities, in line with model predictions.</description>
