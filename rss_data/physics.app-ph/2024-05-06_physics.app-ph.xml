      <title>Internet of Paint (IoP): Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for Terahertz Electromagnetic Nanonetworks Embedded in Paint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work opens a new chapter in the 100,000 year-old concept of paint, by leveraging innovations in nano-technology in the sub-THz frequency range. More specifically, the groundbreaking concept of Internet of Paint (IoP) is introduced along with a comprehensive channel model and a capacity analysis for nano-scale radios embedded in paint and communicating through paint. Nano-network devices, integrated within a paint medium, communicate via a multipath strategy, encompassing direct waves, reflections from interfaces, and lateral wave propagation. The evaluation incorporates three distinct paint types to assess path losses, received powers, and channel capacity. Analysis of path loss indicates a slight non-linear increase with both frequency and Line of Sight (LoS) distance between transceivers. Notably, paints with high refractive indexes result in the highest path loss. Moreover, burying transceivers at similar depths near the Air-Paint interface showcases promising performance of lateral waves with increasing LoS distance. Increasing paint layer depth leads to amplified attenuation, while total received power exhibits promising results when in close proximity to the Air-Paint interface but steeply declines with burial depth. Additionally, a substantial reduction in channel capacity is observed with LoS distance and burial depth, so transceivers need to be close together and in proximity of the A-P interface to communicate effectively. Comparing paint and air mediums, IoP demonstrates approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in channel capacity compared to air-based communication channels. This paper provides valuable insights into the potential of IoP communication within paint mediums and offers a foundation for further advancements in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Triboelectric Pixels as building blocks for microscale and large area integration of drop energy harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate step towards the exploitation of water as a clean and renewable energy source addresses the energies stored in the low frequencies of liquid flows, which demands flexible solutions to adapt to multiple scenarios, from raindrops to waves, including water moving in pipelines and microdevices. Thus, harvesting low-frequency flows is a young concept compared to solar and wind powers, where triboelectric nanogenerators have been revealed as the most promising relevant actors. However, despite widespread attempts by researchers, the drop energy harvesters' output power is still low, mainly because of the limitations in candidates endowed with ideal triboelectric and wetting properties and also the non-optimal and centimetre-scale device architecture that prevents the conversion of the complete kinetic energy of impinging drops. Herein, we disclose a microscale triboelectric nanogenerator that can harvest a high density of electrical power from drops through a single, submillisecond, long-lasting step. The mechanism relies on an instantaneous electrical capacitance variation owing to the high-speed contact of the drops with the electrodes' active area. We discuss the role of the precharged effect of the triboelectric surface in the time characteristic of the conversion event. The capacitive and microscale structure of the device is endowed with a small form factor that allows for the production of densely packed arrays. The proposed architecture can be adjusted to different liquids and scales and is compatible with a variety of triboelectric surfaces, including flexible, transparent, and thin-film approaches.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear magnetic sensing with hybrid nitrogen-vacancy/magnon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic sensing beyond linear regime could broaden the frequency range of detectable magnetic fields, which is crucial to various microwave and quantum applications. Recently, nonlinear interactions in diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, one of the most extensively studied quantum magnetic sensors, are proposed to realize magnetic sensing across arbitrary frequencies. In this work, we enhance these capabilities by exploiting the nonlinear spin dynamics in hybrid systems of NV centers and ferri- or ferro-magnetic (FM) thin films. We study the frequency mixing effect in the hybrid NV/magnon systems, and demonstrate that the introduction of FM not only amplifies the intensity of nonlinear resonance signals that are intrinsic to NV spins, but also enables novel frequency mixings through parametric pumping and nonlinear magnon scattering effects. The discovery and understanding of the magnetic nonlinearities in hybrid NV/magnon systems position them as a prime candidate for magnetic sensing with a broad frequency range and high tunablity, particularly meaningful for nanoscale, dynamical, and non-invasive materials characterization.</description>

      <title>Tailored Fabrication of 3D Nanopores with Dielectric Oxides for Multiple Nanoscale Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopore sensing is a key technology for single-molecule detection and analysis. Solid-state nanopores have emerged as a versatile platform, since their fabrication allows to engineer their properties by controlling size, shape, and chemical functionalization. However, lithography-based fabrication approaches for non-planar nanopores-on-chip rely on polymers that have limits with respect to hard- and robustness, durability, and refractive index. In this respect, nanopores made of metal oxides with high dielectric constant would be much more favourable and have the potential to extend the suitability of solid-state nanopores towards optoelectronic technologies. Here, we present a versatile method to fabricate three-dimensional nanopores of different dielectric oxides with controlled shapes. Our approach uses photoresist only as a template in the focused-ion-beam lithography to define the nanopore shape, which is subsequently coated with different oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and HfO2) by atomic-layer deposition. Then the photoresist is fully removed by chemo-physical treatment, resulting in nanopores entirely made from dielectric oxides on a thin solid-state membrane. Our methodology allows straightforward fabrication of convex, straight, and concave nanopore shapes that can be employed in various technologies and applications. We explored their performance as ionic nanochannels and investigated the dependence of the ionic current rectification on the nanopore geometry. We found hysteresis in the ionic conductance that enables potential applications of the nanopores in memristors. We also investigated the dielectric oxide nanopores for DNA sensing by measuring both cis-trans and trans-cis translocations and support our data with numerical simulations based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Si:S barrier infrared detector with broadband response up to 4.4{\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectrum is a critical tool for chemical analysis, industrial inspection, environment, and other fields due to its rich chemical bond information. However, the complicated growth or fabrication procedures of existing mid-infrared sensitive materials hinder the large-scale production and utilization of mid-infrared detectors. To address this issue, we developed Si:S barrier detectors employing sulfur doped silicon and a sophisticated band barrier design. Since the transport of dark current and photo current is separated, the barrier design effectively suppresses the dark current while allowing the photo current to leverage gain mechanisms, thereby substantially improving signal-to-noise ratio. As a result, the detector exhibits an infrared response range covering from 1.12 to 4.4{\mu}m with a peak at 3.3{\mu}m, excluding its intrinsic response in visible range. Its peak quantum efficiency surpasses that of the best mid-infrared silicon-based detector reported to date by an order of magnitude, reaching 2% at room temperature. The peak detectivity at 90K is 1.4E11 Jones @1.4V and decreases to 4.4E9 Jones @1.4V, 210K, comparable to the typical III-V and IV-VI photodetectors at one thousandth fabrication cost. Leveraging the well-established silicon-based manufacturing process, this device holds promise for large-scale production at a reduced price, offering a cost-effective solution for future mid-infrared detection.</description>

      <title>Modular plasmonic nanopore for opto-thermal gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state nanopore gating inspired by biological ion channels is gaining increasing traction due to a large range of applications in biosensing and drug delivery. Integration of stimuli-responsive molecules such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) inside nanopores can enable temperature-dependent gating, which so far has only been demonstrated using external heaters. In this work, we combine plasmonic resonators inside the nanopore architecture with PNIPAM to enable optical gating of individual or multiple nanopores with micrometer resolution and a switching speed of few milliseconds by thermo-plasmonics. We achieve a temperature change of 40 kelvin per millisecond and demonstrate the efficacy of this method using nanopore ionic conductivity measurements that enables selective activation of individual nanopores in an array. Moreover, the selective gating of specific nanopores in an array can set distinct ionic conductance levels: low, medium, and high (i.e., 0, 1, and 2), which could be exploited for logical gating with optical signal control. Such selective optical gating in nanopore arrays marks a breakthrough in nanofluidics, as it paves the way towards smart devices that offer multifunctional applications including biosensing, targeted drug delivery, and fluidic mixing.</description>

Abstract: In this scientific article, the data on air pollution by PM2.5 particulate matter was evaluated in different locations in the city of Cusco with respect to the Environmental Quality Indexes (INCA) of the Ministry of the Environment of the Peruvian Government. The results show that air pollution in the city of Cusco is an environmental risk problem. More than 84% of the monitored sites have a bad rating (101-500), the corresponding color is orange. This result shows that the air that citizens of Cusco breathe is of poor quality and the population could experience health problems. The recommendation is to avoid outdoor exercises and activities. In the district of San Jeronimo Cusco, the average concentration has been 125 ug/m3, which corresponds to the INCA interval of more than 125, within the red color threshold for care. The health effects are described as chronic lung and cardiovascular diseases, and the health authority should declare levels of alert. It has been concluded that according to INCA, the air in the city of Cusco is of poor quality and falls within the threshold of the Care State Value (VUEC).</description>

      <title>Predicting the impact of water transport on carbonation-induced corrosion in variably saturated reinforced concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modelling framework for predicting carbonation-induced corrosion in reinforced concrete is presented. The framework constituents include a new model for water transport in cracked concrete, a link between corrosion current density and water saturation, and a theory for characterising concrete carbonation. The theoretical framework is numerically implemented using the finite element method and model predictions are extensively benchmarked against experimental data. The results show that the model is capable of accurately predicting carbonation progress, as well as wetting and drying of cracked and uncracked concrete, revealing a very good agreement with independent experiments from a set of consistent parameters. In addition, insight is gained into the evolution of carbonation penetration and corrosion current density under periodic wetting and drying conditions. Among others, we find that cyclic wetting periods significantly speed up the carbonation progress and that the induced corrosion current density is very sensitive to concrete saturation.</description>

      <title>Laser wakefield acceleration of ions with a transverse flying focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>

Abstract: This review article highlights state-of-the-art data-driven techniques to discover, encode, surrogate, or emulate constitutive laws that describe the path-independent and path-dependent response of solids. Our objective is to provide an organized taxonomy to a large spectrum of methodologies developed in the past decades and to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the various techniques for interpreting and forecasting mechanics behavior across different scales. Distinguishing between machine-learning-based and model-free methods, we further categorize approaches based on their interpretability and on their learning process/type of required data, while discussing the key problems of generalization and trustworthiness. We attempt to provide a road map of how these can be reconciled in a data-availability-aware context. We also touch upon relevant aspects such as data sampling techniques, design of experiments, verification, and validation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of fatigue life of TiN coatings using cyclic micro-impact testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the behaviour of a thin titanium nitride (TiN) coating (1.5 um thick) on a tool steel substrate material under dynamic and cyclic impacts through an approach combining experimental testing and computational modelling. Dynamic impact testing was used to investigate the load-dependent dynamic hardness and assess the energy-dissipation capabilities of the coating system. In cyclic impact tests, the materials experienced permanent plastic deformation in each cycle, ultimately leading to coating failure. Chemical analysis identified an interlayer between the coating and the substrate, while cross-sectional analysis revealed the extent of coating damage due to cycling and impact load. A three-dimensional map was constructed, connecting the acceleration load, sensed depth, and cycles to the coating failure, and an empirical equation used to characterize the relationship between the depth and cycles to failure. The computational model examined the traction component distribution during loading and unloading, with a focus on normal and shear tractions. These findings suggested the potential significance of normal traction in the interfacial fatigue failure due to impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial structures have been widely used to manipulate sound fields. Most properties of these structures derive from the material and geometry. Few are explicitly related to the structural topology in the real space. Here, we discover a fundamental connection between the real-space topology of acoustic structures and the topological properties of sound fields. We find that the genus of acoustic cavities can protect the birth of singularities in velocity polarization and isopressure line fields. The total topological index of the surface singularities is equal to the cavities' Euler characteristic. This intriguing relationship is rooted in the Poincare-Hopf theorem and is irrelevant to the specific material, geometric details, or excitation properties. The isopressure line singularities lead to acoustic hotspots and quiet zones. The velocity polarization singularities give rise to nontrivial polarization Mobius strips and skyrmion textures. The results enable sound sculpturing with structural topology and can find applications in acoustic communications, acoustic sensing, and noise control.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Calculations of Nonlinear Susceptibility and Multi-Phonon Mixing Processes in a 2DEG-Piezoelectric Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in situ coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), which harnesses the coherent interference between a strong and a weak beam illuminating a static and dynamic structure, can be a very dose-efficient imaging method. At low doses, in situ CDI can achieve higher resolution than perfect lenses with the point spread function as a delta function. Both our numerical simulation and experimental results show that the combination of in situ CDI and ptychography can reduce the dose by two orders of magnitude over ptychography. We expect that computational microscopy based on in situ CDI can be implemented in different imaging modalities with photons and electrons for low-dose imaging of radiation-sensitive materials and biological samples.</description>

      <title>Optically-Transparent EM Skins for Outdoor-to-Indoor mm-Wave Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically-transparent opportunistic electromagnetic skins (OTO-EMSs) are proposed to enable outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) millimiter-wave (mmW) wireless communications with existing windows/glass-panels. More in detail, static passive EMSs consisting of optically-transparent conducting patterned layers attached to standard glass-panels are designed. Towards this end, both the phase coverage and the optical transparency of a meshed copper-based meta-atom printed on a non-dedicated insulated glass substrate are optimized. Successively, the feasibility of OTO-EMSs able to support mmW high-efficiency O2I transmissions along non-Snell refraction directions is numerically demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Sol-gel transition by evaporation in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09990</link>

Abstract: Historical monuments, outdoor stone sculptures and artworks made of porous materials are exposed to chemical and physical degradation over time. Presently, the most promising route for consolidation of weakened porous materials is the injection of viscoelastic solutions of polymerizing compounds. Those compounds, after injection, undergo a sol-gel transition inside the porous media through evaporation of the solvent. Finding a suitable gelifying solution as a consolidant calls for understanding the drying kinetics of viscoelastic fluids in porous media. Here, we present a multiscale study of the drying kinetics of solutions during the sol-gel transition. We investigate the drying dynamics and subsequent water uptake of a gel using NMR and X-ray microtomography techniques in porous materials. We find that during drying, a distinct front develops which separates the liquid region from the gelled region. This front advances from the free surface of evaporation towards the inner parts of the stone. We identify different drying periods which appear to be dependent on the intrinsic properties of the porous medium influencing strongly the homogeneity of the final gel distribution within a treated stone. Our findings not only are relevant for the consolidation of porous artworks but also for civil and soil engineering processes where the fluids considered are generally more complex than water.</description>

      <title>Electrically Programmable Pixelated Graphene-Integrated Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Coherent Mid-Infrared Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces have recently emerged as compact, lightweight, and efficient platforms for dynamic control of electromagnetic fields and optical responses. However, the complexities associated with their post-fabrication tunability significantly hinder their widespread applications, especially for the mid-infrared range due to material scarcity and design intricacy. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly dynamic, pixelated modulations of coherent mid-infrared emission based on an electrically programmable plasmonic metasurface integrated with graphene field effect transistors (Gr-FETs). The ultrabroad infrared transparency of graphene allows for free-form control over plasmonic meta-atoms, thus achieving coherent mid-infrared states across a broad range of wavelengths and polarizations. The spatial temperature modulation generated by Gr-FETs is effectively synergized with the emissivity control by the localized surface plasmon polaritons from gold nanoantennas. This integrated temperature-emissivity modulation of metasurfaces is systematically extended to form a pixelated 2D array, envisioning new approaches toward scalable 2D electrical wiring for densely packed, independently controlled pixels.</description>

      <title>Growth of metal nanoparticles in hydrocarbon atmosphere of arc discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct current (DC) arc discharge is a widely used method for large-scale production of metal nanoparticles, core-shell particles, and carbon nanotubes. Here, we explore the growth of iron nanoparticles in a modified DC arc discharge. Iron particles are produced by the evaporation of an anode, made from low-carbon steel. Methane admixture into argon gas serves as a carbon source. Electron microscopy and elemental analysis suggest that hydrocarbons decompose on iron clusters forming a carbon shell, which inhibits iron particle growth until its full encapsulation, at which point the iron core growth is ceased. Experimental observations are explained using an aerosol growth model. The results demonstrate the path to manipulate metal particle size in a hydrocarbon arc environment.</description>

      <title>Tunable Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Index-Discontinuous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in metasurfaces are promising in applications of sub-wavelength devices.Tunable and multimodal SLRs further enhance their appeal for flexible and multi-wavelength light-matter interactions. While multimodal SLRs offer promising properties, their realization often requires sophisticated designs, leading to limited tunability. Furthermore, current high-Q SLR implementations necessitate a homogeneous index in the operational environment, restricting potential applications such as biosensors that are typically operated in an aqueous or air cladding on a substrate. Here we present guided-SLRs (gSLRs) that are easily accessible in index-discontinuous environments, offering multimodal properties and straightforward tunability of resonances wavelengths, mode number, and mode coupling strengths. The gSLRs are achieved by coupling scattered light from metasurface units into a slab waveguide, creating a light ropagating channel in the lattice plane within an index-asymmetric environment. Tailoring the radiation pattern of individual units with guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, multimodal resonances in both orthogonal and parallel coupling directions are accomplished. Mode number and mode frequency positions can be easily controlled by adjusting the waveguide configuration, while mode strength is tuned by vertical positions of lattices in the slab. Multimodal gSLRs with strong intensities and tunable ositions extending from visible to near-infrared range are achieved when compose metasurfaces with gold nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavities. This easy-to-access, actively tunable and multimodal gSLR in inhomogeneous mediums will advance the realization of ultrathin and ultracompact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>
