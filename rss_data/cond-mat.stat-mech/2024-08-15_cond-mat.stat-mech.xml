      <title>Evidence for simple "arrow of time functions" in closed chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis of spin dynamics in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a specific limit of the one-dimensional non-Hermitian Hubbard Hamiltonian with complex interactions. In this framework, fermions with different spin quantum numbers are mapped onto two distinct spin species, resulting in two $XY$ spin chains that are coupled through Ising $ZZ$ interaction. The spin ladder model is then examined within the semiclassical limit using a spin-coherent state basis, where the dynamics is governed by a set of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. The non-Hermitian interactions in this model generate a spin-transfer torque term. We analyze the system's evolution toward several potential steady states, including a state of decoupled chains that is accessible when each chain has uniform initial conditions. Other possible steady states involve dimerized configurations with decoupled rungs, where the rung spins are either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically coupled, depending on the sign of the imaginary interactions. The spin dynamics is then studied in the infinite-temperature limit, which favors dimerized steady states. Despite the decoupled rungs, we observe the formation of ferromagnetic domains along each chain in the steady state. Additionally, we investigate the spin correlation functions and identify signatures of anomalous spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Identifying Patterns Using Cross-Correlation Random Matrices Derived from Deterministic and Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Correlation random matrices have emerged as a promising indicator of phase transitions in spin systems. The core concept is that the evolution of magnetization encapsulates thermodynamic information [R. da Silva, Int. J. Mod. Phys. C, 2350061 (2023)], which is directly reflected in the eigenvalues of these matrices. When these evolutions are analyzed in the mean-field regime, an important question arises: Can the Langevin equation, when translated into maps, perform the same function? Some studies suggest that this method may also capture the chaotic behavior of certain systems. In this work, we propose that the spectral properties of random matrices constructed from maps derived from deterministic or stochastic differential equations can indicate the critical or chaotic behavior of such systems. For chaotic systems, we need only the evolution of iterated Hamiltonian equations, and for spin systems, the Langevin maps obtained from mean-field equations suffice, thus avoiding the need for Monte Carlo (MC) simulations or other techniques.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions I: Graded Influence Actions for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03580v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This series of papers has two broader aims: 1) Construct a theory for multi-partite open quantum systems comprising several layers of structure with self-consistent back-actions. Develop the graded influence action formalism \cite{BehHu10,BH11} to account for the influences of successive sub-layers on the dynamics of the variables of interest. 2) Apply these methods to the study of atom-field-medium interactions and highlight their merits over conventional methods. We consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms (A), interacting with a quantum field (F), scalar here, for simplicity, altered by the presence of a dielectric medium (M). In this paper we use the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions in the influence functional formalism to derive the stochastic equations for the reduced density matrices of the dynamical variables in the successive layers of structure. The word `graded' refers to the specific ordering of the coarse-graining procedures. Three layers of coarse-graining are performed, firstly, integrating over the common bath of the dielectric oscillators results not only in the appearance of necessary dissipative properties of the dielectric but also essential nuanced features such as nonMarkovian spatial correlations in the dielectric. Secondly, integrating over the medium variables as a whole results in a dielectric-modified quantum field, the influence of the medium on the quantum field manifesting through a frequency-dependent permittivity function. Finally, integrating over this dielectric-altered quantum field which interacts with the idfs of the atoms yields an influence action. From it we obtain the stochastic equation of motion which describes the nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of the idf of the atoms interacting with a dielectric medium-modified quantum field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effects in many-body localization systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems have attracted growing attention due to various intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. One famous example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where the subsystem symmetry is restored faster under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. The quantum Mpemba effect has been extensively studied in integrable and chaotic systems. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems with various initial states. We reveal that the symmetry can still be fully restored in many-body localization phases without approaching thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect is universal for any initial tilted product state, contrasting to the cases in the chaotic systems where the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect relies on the choice of initial states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effects with the help of the effective model for many-body localization. This Letter not only sheds light on extending the quantum Mpemba effect to more non-equilibrium settings but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Active Liquid-Liquid Phase-Separation in a Confining Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a confining environment is believed to play an important role in cell biology. Recently, it was shown that when active noise at the microscopic level is included in the classical theory of nucleation and growth then this does not cause the breakdown of detailed balance at the \textit{macroscopic} level provided that the droplet radius is the only collective coordinate. Here, we present a simple model for active LLPS in a confining environment, with the droplet location in a confining potential as a second collective coordinate, and find that detailed balance \textit{is} broken at the macroscopic level in an unusual fashion, using the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of liquid viscosity from unstable localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow, governed by atomic-scale friction between its constituent atoms. While viscosity can be directly computed using the Green-Kubo formalism, this method does not fully elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying such momentum transport coefficient. In fact, the microscopic origin of liquid viscosity remains poorly understood. In this work, we calculate the viscosity of a $\mathrm{Cu_{50}Zr_{50}}$ metallic liquid and a Kob-Andersen model in a large range of temperatures and compare the results with a theoretical formula based on nonaffine linear response and instantaneous normal mode theory. This analysis reveals that only unstable localized instantaneous normal modes (ULINMs) contribute to viscosity, providing a microscopic definition of viscosity as diffusive momentum transport facilitated by local structural excitations mediated by ULINMs as precursors. Leveraging on the concept of configurational entropy, a quantitative model to connect viscosity with ULINMs is also proposed and validated in both the Arrhenius and non-Arrhenius regimes. In summary, our work provides a microscopic definition of liquid viscosity and highlights the fundamental role of ULINMs as its building blocks, ultimately opening the path to an atomic-scale prediction of viscosity in liquids and glasses.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy models for patterns of gene expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New experimental methods make it possible to measure the expression levels of many genes, simultaneously, in snapshots from thousands or even millions of individual cells. Current approaches to analyze these experiments involve clustering or low-dimensional projections. Here we use the principle of maximum entropy to obtain a probabilistic description that captures the observed presence or absence of mRNAs from hundreds of genes in cells from the mammalian brain. We construct the Ising model compatible with experimental means and pairwise correlations, and validate it by showing that it gives good predictions for higher-order statistics. We notice that the probability distribution of cell states has many local maxima. By labeling cell states according to the associated maximum, we obtain a cell classification that agrees well with previous results that use traditional clustering techniques. Our results provide quantitative descriptions of gene expression statistics and interpretable criteria for defining cell classes, supporting the hypothesis that cell classes emerge from the collective interaction of gene expression levels.</description>

      <title>Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disorder-order phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the scalability of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Defects Enhance Stability in 12-fold Symmetric Soft-Matter Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Probing hydrodynamic crossovers with dissipation-assisted operator evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using artificial dissipation to tame entanglement growth, we chart the emergence of diffusion in a generic interacting lattice model for varying U(1) charge densities. We follow the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport above a scale set by the scattering length, finding the intuitive result that the diffusion constant scales as $D \propto 1/\rho$ at low densities $\rho$. Our numerical approach generalizes the Dissipation-Assisted Operator Evolution (DAOE) algorithm: in the spirit of the BBGKY hierarchy, we effectively approximate non-local operators by their ensemble averages, rather than discarding them entirely. This greatly reduces the operator entanglement entropy, while still giving accurate predictions for diffusion constants across all density scales. We further construct a minimal model for the transport crossover, yielding charge correlation functions which agree well with our numerical data. Our results clarify the dominant contributions to hydrodynamic correlation functions of conserved densities, and serve as a guide for generalizations to low temperature transport.</description>

      <title>Current circulation near additional energy degeneracy points in quadratic Fermionic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heat and particle current circulation (CC) in quadratic Fermionic systems analysed using local Lindblad master equation. It was observed in an earlier study (Upadhyay et al. Phys. Rev. E 107, 034120 (2023)). that CC occurs near the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) in Fermionic systems which have some form of asymmetry. We find general analytical expression to support this observation for quadratic Fermionic networks. We then apply these ideas to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with periodic boundary conditions and a tight binding model with unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches. In both these cases, we find the specific conditions required for observing CC and study the behavior of these currents with various system parameters. We find that having unequal number of Fermionic sites in the upper and lower branches is enough for generating CC in the SSH model. However, this asymmetry is not adequate for the tight-binding model and we require unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches to induce CC in this model. We also compare our results with the exact results obtained via the Non-Equilibrium Green Function (NEGF) formalism , and observe that the relationship between AEDP and CC also holds for the exact results. Finally, we observe that for certain system parameters, the onset point of particle and heat CC are not the same. Based on all these observations, we describe how carefully examining the energy spectrum of the system gives a great deal of information about the possibility and behavior of CC in Fermionic systems with asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic concentration inequalities and tradeoff relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic tradeoff relations quantify the fundamental concept of ``no free lunch'' in the physical world, suggesting that faster and more precise physical processes come at a higher thermodynamic cost. The key elements in these tradeoff relations are the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and speed limit, which are closely tied to information inequalities from which other tradeoff relations are derived. Concentration inequalities are relations that complement information inequalities in statistical analyses and have been widely used in various fields. However, their role in thermodynamic tradeoff relations remains unclear. This Letter develops thermodynamic concentration inequalities that provide bounds for the distribution of observables in quantum and classical Markov processes. We derive a set of tradeoff relations that generalize speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations from the developed thermodynamic concentration inequalities. The derived tradeoff relations hold under minimal assumptions of the underlying physical processes. This Letter clarifies the role of concentration inequalities in thermodynamics, paving the way for deriving new tradeoff relations.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Correlations in Elastic Moduli and Local Stresses at the Unjamming Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of spatially heterogeneous elastic moduli as well as the correlations between local moduli in model solids with short-range repulsive potentials. We show through numerical simulations that local elastic moduli exhibit long-range correlations, similar to correlations in the local stresses. Specifically, the correlations in local shear moduli exhibit anisotropic behavior at large lengthscales characterized by pinch-point singularities in Fourier space, displaying a structural pattern akin to shear stress correlations. Focussing on two-dimensional jammed solids approaching the unjamming transition, we show that stress correlations exhibit universal properties, characterized by a quadratic $p^2$ dependence of the correlations as the pressure $p$ approaches zero, independent of the details of the model. In contrast, the modulus correlations exhibit a power-law dependence with different exponents depending on the specific interaction potential. Furthermore, we illustrate that while affine responses lack long-range correlations, the total modulus, which encompasses non-affine behavior, exhibits long-range correlations.</description>
