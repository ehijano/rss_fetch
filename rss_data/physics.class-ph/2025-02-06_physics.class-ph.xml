      <title>Phase space fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perhaps the simplest approach to constructing models with sub-dimensional particles or fractons is to require the conservation of dipole or higher multipole moments. We generalize this approach to allow for moments in phase space and classify all possible classical fracton models with phase-space multipole conservation laws. We focus on a new self-dual model that conserves both dipole and quadrupole moments in position and momentum; we analyze its dynamics and find quasi-periodic orbits in phase space that evade ergodic exploration of the full phase space.</description>

      <title>Propagation through metamaterial temporal slabs: transmission, reflection and special cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying metamaterials are artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties change over time. Similar to a spatial medium discontinuity, a sudden change in time of the metamaterial refractive index induces the generation of a reflected and refracted light waves. The relationship between the incident and emerging fields at one temporal interface has been subject of investigation in earlier studies. Here, we extend the study to a temporal slab, i.e., a uniform homogeneous medium that is present in the whole space for a limited time. The scattering coefficients have been derived as a function of the refractive indices and application time, demonstrating that the response of the temporal slab can be controlled through the application time, which acts similarly to the electrical thickness of conventional spatial slabs. The results reported in this letter pave the way to novel devices based on temporal discontinuities, such as temporal matching networks, Bragg grating, dielectric mirrors, which exhibit zero space occupancy by exploiting the time dimension, instead of the spatial one.</description>

      <title>Local Field Statistics in Linear Elastic Unidirectional Fibrous Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical fluctuations of local tensorial fields beyond the mean are relevant to predict localized failure or overall behavior of the inelastic composites. The expression for second moments of the local fields can be established using the Hill-Mandel condition. Complete estimation of statistical fluctuations via second moments is usually ignored despite its significance. In Eshelby-based mean-field approaches, the second moments are evaluated through derivatives of Hill's Polarization tensor $ \left ( \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}} \right )$ using a singular approximation. Typically, semi-analytical procedures using numerical integration are used to evaluate the derivatives of the polarization tensor $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}}$. Here, new analytically derived explicit expressions are presented for calculating the derivatives, specifically for unidirectional fibrous composites with isotropic phases. Full-field homogenization using finite element is used to compute the statistical distribution of local fields (exact solution) for the class of random fibrous microstructures. The mean-field estimates are validated with the exact solution across different fiber volume fractions and aspect ratios. The results indicate that the fiber volume fraction significantly influences the fluctuation of stress tensor invariants, whereas the aspect ratio has minimal effect.</description>
