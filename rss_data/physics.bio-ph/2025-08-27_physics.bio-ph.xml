      <title>The Protein Force Field Plays a Crucial Role in Obtaining Accurate Macromolecular Ensembles of IDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play a significant role in intracellular phenomena and are known to exist in an ensemble of inter-converting conformations in solution. Accurately modeling the conformations of IDPs in solution poses a challenge to traditional force fields that are tuned to predict the properties of folded proteins. There is a need for generalized atomistic force fields that can accurately predict the properties of both folded proteins and IDPs. Improvements to protein force fields for increased accuracy in secondary structure prediction and new water models with increased water-water dispersion interactions have been proposed in search of a generalized simulation method. Validating the proposed improvements against experiments poses challenges such as a lack of suitable systems to test the generalizability and choosing a property of interest to match the simulation results against experiments. In this work, we use small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data from peptide-based polyampholytes that mimic IDPs to test the generalizability of the AMBER protein force fields and the OPC water model. The specific improvements due to the AMBER ff19SB protein force field and the OPC water model are isolated and studied. Analysis of SAXS profiles and the conformational distribution of polyampholyte sequences show the AMBER ff19SB-OPC water combination to be a generalized model that predicts both ordered polyampholyte sequences and disordered polyampholyte sequences in good agreement with experiments. We have developed a new scattering model termed SWAXS-AMDE that accounts for the hydration layer density changes in atomic detail and is particularly useful in making one-to-one comparisons of simulated scattering profiles to experiments. SWAXS-AMDE allows for the thermal fluctuations of the solute which is particularly consequential for IDPs.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and mechanical response in biological structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigidity is an emergent property of materials - it is not a feature of individual components that comprise the structure, but instead arises from interactions between many constituent parts. Recently, it has been recognized that floppy-rigid or fluid-solid transitions are harnessed by biological systems at all scales to drive form and function. This review focuses on the different mechanisms that can drive emergent rigidity transitions in biomechanical networks, and describes how they arise in mathematical formalisms and how they are observed in practice in experiments. The goal is to aid researchers in identifying mechanisms governing rigidity in their biological systems of interest, highlight mechanical features that are universal across different systems, and help drive new scientific hypotheses for observed mechanical phenomena in biology. Looking forward, we also discuss how biological systems might tune themselves towards or away from such transitions over developmental or evolutionary timescales.</description>

      <title>Parameter degeneracy in the vertex model for tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vertex model with homogeneous cell properties is known to exhibit a parameter degeneracy in which the system's dynamics is independent of the target area. Here, we show, for the heterogeneous vertex model where cells differ in size and stiffness, that degeneracy is also present with the average product of target areas and stiffness becoming dynamically irrelevant. Fixing this quantity is equivalent to fixing the global internal tissue pressure. Unless properly treated, this degeneracy undermines the physical relevance of key observables' numerical values, such as the shape index, cell pressure, and cell stress tensor. We present methods to resolve the degeneracy and to correctly set the gauge pressure via symmetry transformations applied to the cells' target areas. We further demonstrate that the degeneracy is removed under certain boundary conditions and partially lifted when spherical tissues are modeled using a locally planar approximation, leading to numerical consequences when fitting model parameters to experimental data. The approach extends beyond vertex models and provides a framework for testing whether the parameter spaces of other physical models are free from degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Enzyme-free in situ polymerization of conductive polymers catalyzed by porous Au@Ag nanowires for stretchable neural electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In situ polymerization of conductive polymers (CPs) represents a transformative approach in bioelectronics, by enabling the controlled growth of electrically active materials right at the tissue or device surface to create seamless biotic-abiotic interfaces. Traditional CP deposition techniques often use high anodic potentials, non-physiological electrolytes, or strong oxidants, making them harmful to adjacent tissues. A possible solution is enzymatic polymerization which operates under milder conditions, but it is limited by the stability and activity window of the enzyme catalysts, low throughput, and challenges in spatially confining polymer growth. To resolve these issues, here we developed one-dimensional porous Au-coated Ag nanowires with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-like catalytic properties, thereby for the first time enabling mild in situ enzyme-free polymerization of conductive polymers near neutral pH. The enzyme-free polymerization is demonstrated both in aqueous dispersions at pH=6 and in situ onto porous Au coated Ag nanowire based stretchable electrodes. Following enzyme-free catalytic polymerization, the electrically conducting polymer coating on the electrode greatly improves the impedance and achieves an impedance of 2.6 kOhm at 1 kHz for 50x50 um large electrodes.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery and Formulation Refines the Quasi-Steady Model of Flapping-Wing Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology, physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs: high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models, we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000 candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying robots.</description>

      <title>Locally tuned hydrodynamics of active polymer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ mesoscopic simulations to study active polymers in a solvent via multi-particle collision dynamics. We investigate linear chains in which either the head or tail monomer exerts an active force, directed away from or towards its neighbor, respectively, while the remaining monomers are passive. We find that, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the active monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic properties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it, straightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as activity-induced stiffening. In contrast, an active tail pushes into the chain, causing crumpling. This leads to faster decorrelation of the polymer backbone over time, rendering the active motion less persistent. These effects occur regardless of whether hydrodynamic interactions are included or not. Hydrodynamics is included by the imposition of a local counter-force in the surrounding fluid, as opposed to distributing the former equally to all fluid elements. By specifying the position of this counterforce onto the fluid, we can tune the hydrodynamic flow fields of the active polymers being both contractile and extensile. Interestingly, the emerging pusher- and puller flow fields are strongly influenced by the force propagation inside the polymer chain.</description>

      <title>Junctional-Fluctuation-Mediated Fluidisation of Multi-Phase Field Epithelial Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a multi-phase field model for an epithelial monolayer with pairwise adhesions between neighbouring cells following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, representing the stochastic turnover of junctional molecular motors. These fluctuations in junctional adhesion result in rearrangements in the tissue, fluidising it and producing diffusive cell motion. Similar junctional fluctuations have proven a very useful tool in the vertex model literature, and we hope they will be equally helpful to the multi-phase field model approach. Moreover, we observe that the cells' effective diffusion coefficient depends non-monotonically on the persistence time of the fluctuations, confirming results previously observed in the vertex model.</description>

      <title>Density-Velocity Relation Is Scale-Dependent in Epithelial Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between cell density and velocity is often assumed to be negative, reflecting crowding-induced suppression of movement. However, observations across systems reveal a more nuanced picture: while some emphasize contact inhibition of locomotion, others suggest that dense regions exhibit enhanced activity due to force generation and stress buildup. Here, using experimental measurements we show that density-velocity relations in epithelial monolayers are inherently scale dependent. By coarse-graining cell trajectories over multiple spatial windows, we find that cell velocity correlates positively with local density at small scales, but negatively at large scales. Employing traction force measurements, we find that this crossover coincides with the emergence of mechanical pressure segregation, defining a characteristic length scale beyond which crowding dominates. A minimal model incorporating activity-induced shape changes reproduces this crossover and identifies the competition between active force generation and mechanical confinement as the underlying mechanism. Our results reconcile conflicting views of density-regulated migration and highlight an emergent length scale as a key factor in interpreting collective cell dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the temporal dependence of ecological interaction measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species interactions (ranging from direct predator prey relationships to indirect effects mediated by the environment) are central to ecosystem balance and biodiversity. While empirical methods for measuring these interactions exist, their interpretability and limitations remain unclear. Here we examine the empirical matrix of pairwise interactions, a widely used tool, and analyze its temporal variability. We show that apparent fluctuations in interaction strength (and even shifts in interaction signs, often interpreted as transitions between competition and facilitation) can arise intrinsically from population dynamics with fixed ecological roles. Experimental protocols further shape these estimates: the duration of observation and the type of setup in microbial growth studies (e.g., chemostats, batch cultures, or resource conditions) systematically affect measured interactions. Considering interactions across timescales enhances interpretability: short-term measurements primarily capture direct species couplings, whereas long-term observations increasingly reflect indirect community feedback. Taken together, these results establish short duration inferences, obtained either directly or extrapolated, as a principled way to disentangle direct from indirect interactions. Building on this insight, we propose a model inference approach that leverages multiple short time series rather than extended longitudinal datasets.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>

Abstract: The structure of grey matter has long been a key focus in neuroscience, as cell morphology varies by type and can be affected by neurological conditions. Understanding these variations is essential for studying brain function and disease. Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool for examining cellular microstructure in vivo. However, for dMRI to accurately reflect cellular features, it is crucial to determine which aspects of morphology influence its measurements. Proper interpretation of dMRI data depends on understanding its sensitivity to different cellular characteristics.
  Despite growing interest in cellular morphology, there has been no systematic report on the key features defining different neural cell types. To address this, we analyzed over 11,500 three-dimensional cellular reconstructions across three species and nine cell types, establishing reference values for critical morphological traits. These traits fall into three categories: structural features that define the cell's skeletal framework, shape features that describe spatial organization, and topological features that break down cellular structure to distinguish cell types. Beyond reporting these reference values, we examine their relevance for dMRI, identifying which neural features dMRI can detect and which cell types may be distinguishable. To complement the statistical analysis, we also provide high resolution 3D surface meshes representative of each cell type and species.
  This work provides essential benchmarks for grey matter research, offering new guidelines on linking neuroimaging measurements to neurobiology. These reference values will be a valuable resource for neuroscientists and neuroimaging researchers, aiding in the interpretation of imaging data and the refinement of brain tissue models.</description>

      <title>Microbiomes Through The Looking Glass: Linking species interactions to dysbiosis through a disordered Lotka-Volterra framework</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has significantly enhanced our ability to study microbial communities. The eubiotic composition of these communities is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and host health. Species diversity is only one facet of a healthy community organization; together with abundance distributions and interaction structures, it shapes reproducible macroecological states, i.e., joint statistical fingerprints that summarize whole-community behavior. Despite recent developments, a theoretical framework connecting empirical data with ecosystem modeling is still in its infancy, particularly in the context of disordered systems. Here, we present a novel framework that couples statistical physics tools for disordered systems with metagenomic data, explicitly linking diversity, interactions, and stability to define and compare these macroecological states. By employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions, we reveal two different emergent patterns of species interaction networks and species abundance distributions for healthy and diseased microbiomes. On the one hand, healthy microbiomes have similar community structures across individuals, characterized by strong species interactions and abundance diversity consistent with neutral stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, diseased microbiomes show greater variability driven by deterministic factors, thus resulting in less ecologically stable and more divergent communities. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered system theory to characterize microbiomes and to capture the role of ecological interactions on stability and functioning.</description>

      <title>UniGenX: a unified generative foundation model that couples sequence, structure and function to accelerate scientific design across proteins, molecules and materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD &lt; 2 {\AA}) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.</description>

      <title>Cerebral blood flow monitoring using a deep learning implementation of the two-layer DCS analytical model with a 512x512 SPAD array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) analyzes the autocorrelation function of photons scattered by red blood cells, enabling non-invasive, continuous measurement of deep tissue blood flow at the bedside. Multi-layer DCS models (two- and three-layer) enhance cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) sensitivity and mitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, these models require multiple predefined parameters and are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time bedside monitoring. To address this challenge, we integrate a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with a deep learning (DL)-based approach trained on data generated by the two-layer analytical model. This method bypasses traditional model fitting, enabling real-time CBFi monitoring while minimizing superficial tissue contamination. We first validate our approach using Monte Carlo-simulated test datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for conventional fitting) and enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 55.4%). Additionally, our method effectively isolates shallow blood flow changes and 750-fold faster than single-exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. We further evaluate the system in a healthy adult, achieving real-time CBFi monitoring and pulsatile waveform recovery during a brain activity test using a 512 512 SPAD array sensor. These results highlight the potential of our approach for real-time brain activity monitoring.</description>
