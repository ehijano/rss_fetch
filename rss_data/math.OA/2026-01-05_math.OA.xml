      <title>Sherman-Takeda type theorems for locally C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we will first establish some density results for a locally $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ and then identify a property, called Kaplansky density property (KDP). We then give a induced faithful continuous $*$-representation $\varphi$ of $\mathcal A^{**}$ (equipped with unique Arens product) on the space $B_{loc}(\mathcal H)$ such that $\varphi(\mathcal A^{**})\subset \overline{\pi(\mathcal A)}^{WOT}$, where $\pi:\mathcal A\to B_{loc}(\mathcal H)$ is the associated universal $*$-representation and $\mathcal H$ is the associated locally Hilbert space. Finally we show that for a Fr\'echet locally $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ possessing KDP, the second strong dual is algebraically and topologically $*$-isomorphic to $ \overline{\pi(\mathcal A)}^{WOT}$, which is a direct analogue of the classical Sherman-Takeda theorem for $C^*$-algebras. We shall also observe the joint continuity of some associated bilinear maps in the running.</description>

      <title>Foguel-type operators similar to contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pisier's celebrated counterexample to Halmos's similarity-to-contractions problem was based on $2 \times 2$ upper triangular block operator matrices involving three classical operators: forward and backward shifts on the diagonal and Hankel operators in the off-diagonal entry. Together with another classical object, namely Toeplitz operators, one can formulate another $2^3 -1 = 7$ types of $2 \times 2$ upper triangular block operator matrices, which we refer to as Foguel-type operators. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of all the seven Foguel-type operators being similar to contractions.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>

      <title>Maximal inequalities for square functions and quantitative mean ergodic theorems associated to group metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish weighted strong and weak type inequalities for non-commutative square functions that naturally arise in the analysis of differences between ball averages and martingale sequences within the framework of group metric measure spaces. Then we use these maximal inequalities to prove a quantitative mean ergodic theorem. Our study extends classical harmonic analysis techniques to the non-commutative setting, revealing intricate interactions between group structures, operator-valued functions, and associated filtration systems.</description>
