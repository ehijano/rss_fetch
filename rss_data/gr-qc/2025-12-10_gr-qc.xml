      <title>Impact on orbital period of X-ray Binary system attached to a cosmic string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings attached to rotating black holes extract its rotational energy, resulting in a mass loss and reduced spin. In this paper we discuss the proposed methods to detect these phenomena and present a novel methodology based on existing literature, by considering a Low Mass X-ray binary system. We investigate the impact of a cosmic string interacting with a black hole in an X-ray binary system and attempt to explain the observations of unexpected orbital period changes in such systems by proposing mass loss by cosmic strings to be a potential cause. For a period change of order $10^{-10}$, the string tension is $\sim 10^{-17}$, lying in the predicted range for cosmic string tension. An analysis of multiple low mass X-ray binary systems is carried out and it is shown that a significant and observable change occurs for a string tension $\sim 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Beyond Extremality: Weak Gravity Conjecture Constraints on Gravitational Lensing in Gravity's Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints imposed by the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) on gravitational lensing in gravity's rainbow, focusing in particular on scenarios beyond extremality and on the interplay between the WGC and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) in the context of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black holes modified by rainbow gravity. Using topological methods, we first analyze the configuration of photon spheres and confirm that unstable circular photon spheres with topological charge $(\omega = -1)$ exist outside the event horizon throughout the parameter space, thereby verifying the simultaneous validity of both the WGC and the WCCC. The rainbow functions $f(\varepsilon)$ and $g(\varepsilon)$, which encode Planck-scale corrections through the energy ratio $(\varepsilon =E/E_P)$, modify both the spacetime metric and the extremality bound. We derive the corresponding modified extremal charge-to-mass ratio, $(q^2/m^2)&gt;(Q^2/M^2)_{\text{ext}}$, and show that gravity's rainbow offers a natural mechanism for reconciling these two fundamental conjectures. By applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in conjunction with Jacobi-Maupertuis optical geometry, we compute the weak deflection angles for both photons and massive particles to second order. The rainbow function $g(\varepsilon)$ appears with powers $(g^{-2})$ and $(g^{-4})$, enhancing the deflection angle when $g(\varepsilon)&lt;1$, while $f(\varepsilon)$ influences only the charge-dependent contributions. At extremality, the deflection angle becomes independent of $f(\varepsilon)$, yielding a universal prediction that can be tested without specifying the form of the rainbow functions. We further find that super-extremal configurations exhibit stronger lensing effects than extremal black holes, suggesting a potential observational discriminator between WGC-satisfying naked singularities and WCCC-preserving black holes.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon gravitational perturbations of rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative calculations of gravitational radiation near horizons of rotating black holes have been plagued with divergence issues. We derive for the first time a divergence-free source term for such cases within the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. As applications, we compute the dynamical deformation of the event horizon caused by an ultrarelativistic particle plunge, demonstrating the excitation of quasinormal modes at the horizon, and we evaluate the energy flux towards the horizon from an extreme mass-ratio inspiral. This framework provides a powerful tool for studying physics near black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal ringing of Kerr black holes. III. Excitation coefficients for equatorial inspirals from the innermost stable circular orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remnant of a black hole binary merger settles into a stationary configuration by "ringing down" through the emission of gravitational waves that consist of a superposition of damped exponentials with discrete complex frequencies - the remnant black hole's quasinormal modes. While the frequencies themselves depend solely on the mass and spin of the remnant, the mode amplitudes depend on the merger dynamics. We investigate quasinormal mode excitation by a point particle plunging from the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole. Our formalism is general, but we focus on computing the quasinormal mode excitation coefficients in the frequency domain for equatorial orbits, and we analyze their dependence on the remnant black hole spin. We find that higher overtones and subdominant multipoles of the radiation become increasingly significant for rapidly rotating black holes. This suggests that the prospects for detecting overtones and higher-order modes are considerably enhanced for highly spinning merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study for Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the gravity 4D Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08047v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $\zeta$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant in $D&lt;5$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Infrared Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscopic framework in which the cosmological exterior is treated as an open quantum subsystem coupled to a horizon reservoir. Local conservation laws, expressed as $\nabla_\mu\langle J^\mu\rangle=0$, imply that when baryon number is lost across a horizon its conserved quantum numbers are sequestered into inaccessible modes, producing an effective depletion in the exterior sector. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the exterior continuity equations. We show that relativity forces these compensating excitations to arise through long-wavelength geometric modes: only infrared fluctuations can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. This identifies an infrared return channel as a generic feature of horizon-coupled semiclassical gravity.
  The second ingredient is a Carnot-Carath\'eodory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $\sigma$ governs both the excitation of these IR modes and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation. In this setting, photon trajectories follow recurrent horizontal geodesics, producing an effective cosmic cavity whose stationary state is a Planck spectrum set by $\sigma$. The same scale modifies large-radius circular motions in a way consistent with flattened rotation curves. Horizon thermodynamics and mesoscopic balance laws then link $\sigma$ to the cosmic expansion rate, $H\sim\sigma$, yielding a unified infrared structure underlying photon equilibrium, baryon balance, and large-scale kinematics.</description>

      <title>Noble gravitational atoms: Self-gravitating black hole scalar wigs with angular momentum number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in a quasi-stationary approximation that describe self-gravitating scalar field configurations around a black hole, including angular momentum number $\ell$. An approach analogous to the one which gives rise to $\ell$-boson stars is used here to construct self-gravitating ``gravitational atoms" with $\ell\ge0$. We refer to these new solutions as {\it noble gravitational atoms}, by analogy with noble atoms, which are characterized by closed electron shells. We show that, in the proper limit, noble gravitational atoms approach $\ell$-boson stars globally, displaying noticeable differences only in a region very close to the event horizon. Noble gravitational atoms with $\ell&gt;0$ sometimes present density maxima located at relatively large radii, with small density close to the horizon for $\ell&gt;1$. Furthermore, they do not always present the typical density spike at the event horizon if $\ell &gt; 0$; on the contrary, they sometimes exhibit a small dip there. When $\ell=0$, a spike can appear, but its contribution to the total mass density is always negligible. The size, density, and lifetime of these objects vary significantly depending on the parameters, being in some cases as large as galaxies, as dilute as dark matter, and as long-lived as the Universe itself.</description>

      <title>High-overtone ringdown fits: start time, no-hair tests, and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overtones are known to improve the performance of fits to the ringdown, both in numerical-relativity simulations and gravitational-wave observations. Although the overtone frequencies are a concrete prediction of general relativity, it remains an open question whether they are excited to the extent that fits would suggest. In this work, we take a pragmatic approach and investigate the practical utility of each additional overtone in extracting information from the ringdown. We look at the dependence of the ringdown start time on the number of overtones, and the feasibility of detecting deviations from general relativity in the ringdown frequencies. We suggest that there is no clear "maximum" overtone, but rather the utility of each additional overtone decreases compared to the one before. Finally, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation (as opposed to least-squares fits) to obtain posterior distributions on the overtone amplitudes and phases, allowing us to investigate their correlation structure. Due to strong correlations it becomes increasingly hard to measure individual amplitudes and phases for the highest overtones. However, we find that the joint measurement of overtone amplitudes (i.e., the correlation structure itself) is sensitive to the frequencies and decay times of even the highest overtones, possibly offering an avenue to perform consistency tests with general relativity.</description>

      <title>Universality in quasinormal modes of a magnetized black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) in magnetized environments are a topic of intense research, both theoretical and observational. In particular, the interaction between charged matter and such objects provides a rich arena with applications ranging from fundamental field theory to high-energy astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the linear stability of a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell solution describing a static, axially symmetric BH immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We probe the dynamics of an external charged scalar field through its quasinormal modes (QNMs), combining frequency- and time-domain analyses. We find a critical value of the field charge at which the QNM spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of approximately $1/2$. This critical behavior admits a simple interpretation in terms of a transition between a confined regime, where waves remain effectively trapped within a region of characteristic size $\sim 1/B$, and a deconfined regime, where the field reaches distances $\gg 1/B$ and the damping rate becomes parametrically small. These results provide qualitative and quantitative insights that may inform more realistic scenarios involving highly magnetized compact objects.</description>

      <title>$D$-dimensional aether charged black hole and aether waves in M-subset of Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the black hole solution and gravitational wave polarizations in a M-subset of the Einstein-aether theory with Lorentz invariance violated by an unit norm vector field -- the aether field $u^a$. This M-subset of Einstein-aether theory has a form of Einstein-Maxwell theory with a term of Lagrange multiplier potential $\lambda(u_au^a\mp1)$. We find that if the aether field is timelike, there is no static black hole solution existing, which is different from the result reported in Phys. Rev. D {\bf64} 024028. When the aether field is spacelike, there exists a static solution -- $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solution, in which the aether charge have a minimum and maximum values. The conception of the aether charge also exists in the $c_i$ subset of the Einstein-aether theory. The Smarr formula and the first law can be still constructed via the extended method of Killing potential. For the linearized M-subset Einstein-aether theory with the timelike aether field, we find the speed of spin-2 modes is unit, which aren't dependent on spacetime dimensions $D$ and aether constant $b_1$, but some parts of polarizations are disappeared. The speed of spin-1 modes is unit also. The third kind mode is the longitudinal aether-metric mode, which is linearly time dependent and not the spin-0 mode.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Strings via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes in Gravitational Wave Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $\lambda \sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $\lambda \sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Careless Whispers: A population of sub-threshold post-merger gravitational waves constrains the hot nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to coherently combine information from a population of sub-threshold, gravitational-wave binary neutron star post-merger remnants. Although no individual event in our synthetic population can be claimed as a confident detection, we show how to statistically determine the fraction of merger events that promptly collapse to form a black hole, compared to those for which a neutron star survives the merger for at least tens of milliseconds. This fraction, when combined with information about the neutron star mass distribution gleaned from the inspiral portion of the signals, provides an indirect measure of the neutron star maximum mass. Using conservative measures of the post-merger waveforms, we show that 50-70 events with binary neutron star inspiral measurements can be combined to give an $11-20\%$ fractional uncertainty on the maximum mass of rapidly rotating, hot neutron stars, which can potentially be turned into a $12-21\%$ fractional constraint on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. We discuss how this measure of the hot nuclear equation of state can be combined with information of cold neutron stars to see the effect of temperature on physics in the densest regions of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Time-Averaged Template for Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Detection in Space-Based Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) poses significant challenges for data analysis and parameter inference in future space-based gravitational-wave missions, such as LISA and Taiji, as it appears as an additional stochastic component along with instrumental noise. Previous studies have developed various approaches to distinguish the SGWB from instrumental noise, often under simplified assumptions such as static or equal-arm configurations. However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty. These findings highlight the importance of realistic template construction for high-precision SGWB analysis in future space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Radiative process of tripartite entangled probes in inertial motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radiative process of three entangled quantum probes initially prepared in a tripartite W state. As a basic set-up, we consider the probes to be inertial in flat spacetime and investigate how the radiative process is affected by different probe configurations. We take the quantum probes as either static or moving with uniform velocities and consider different switching scenarios. Our main observation confirms that the radiative process depends distinctively on the initial configuration in which the probes are arranged, as well as on the direction of the probe velocity. We also extend our analysis to a thermal environment, thereby simulating a more realistic background. We thoroughly discuss the effects due to different switchings, the thermal background, and probe motion on the radiative process of these tripartite entangled probes. We also comment on how the observations from this work can help prepare a set-up least affected by quantum decoherence.</description>

      <title>Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation from Massive Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a quantum-optical treatment of acceleration radiation for atoms freely falling into a Schwarzschild black hole when the ambient field is a massive spin-1 (Proca) field. Building on the HBAR framework of Scully and collaborators, we analyze two detector realizations: a charged-monopole current coupling and a physical electric-dipole coupling, both within a cavity that isolates a single outgoing Schwarzschild mode prepared in the Boulware state. Using a near-horizon stationary-phase analysis, we show that the thermal detailed-balance factor governing excitation versus absorption is universal and depends only on the near-horizon Rindler coordinate transformation. At the same time, the absolute spectra acquire distinctive Proca signatures: a hard mass threshold, polarization-dependent prefactors, and axial/polar greybody transmissions. Promoting single-pass probabilities to escaping rates yields a master equation whose steady state is geometric and whose entropy flux obeys an HBAR-style area-entropy relation identical in form to the scalar case, with all vector-field specifics entering through the radiative area change. Our results provide a controlled pathway to probe longitudinal versus transverse responses, mass thresholds, and polarization-resolved greybody effects in acceleration radiation, and set the stage for extensions to rotating backgrounds, alternative exterior states, and detector-engineering strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle production and radiative properties of a new bumblebee black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum and radiative properties of a recently proposed static bumblebee black hole arising from a general Lorentz-violating vacuum configuration. The analysis begins with the geometric structure of the solution and the thermodynamic temperature obtained from the surface-gravity prescription. The associated thermodynamic topological structure is also examined. Quantum particle production is then analyzed for bosonic and fermionic fields using the tunneling method. Analytic greybody bounds are derived for spin-0, spin-1, spin-2, and spin-1/2 fields. Furthermore, full greybody factors are computed with the sixth-order WKB method, together with the corresponding absorption cross sections and their characteristic spin-dependent peak patterns. These results support the evaluation of the evaporation lifetimes and the emission rates of energy and particle modes associated with each spin contribution, followed by a comparison of the high-frequency regime with other Lorentz-violating geometries, including the \textit{metric} bumblebee, \textit{metric-affine} bumblebee, Kalb-Ramond, and non-commutative Kalb-Ramond black holes. In addition, greybody factors are obtained using a quasinormal-mode-based prescription.</description>

      <title>Brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.</description>

      <title>Geodesic dynamics and multi-inclination images of a non-minimally coupled black hole with a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a black hole in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, illuminated by a thin accretion disk composed of free, electrically neutral plasma. In our setup, matter follows stable circular orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), while inside the ISCO, it rapidly plunges into the black hole. We begin by analyzing the orbital dynamics of massive and massless particles around the black hole. Our results indicate that as the non-minimal coupling parameter increases, the radii of both the ISCO and the photon sphere, together with the corresponding energy and angular momentum for massive particles or the impact parameter for photons, decrease approximately linearly. Moreover, compared with the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, the non-minimal coupling extends the range of the impact parameter and slightly enhances the redshift effect in the images. Additionally, due to the significant influence of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the event horizon, the observed intensity of the non-minimally coupled black hole image under the selected emission model ultimately turns out to be weaker than that of the other two types of black holes, regardless of the inclination angle between the accretion disk and observation planes.</description>

      <title>Regular black hole sourced by the Dehnen-type distribution of matter: The sound of the event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the fundamental and overtone quasinormal modes of a regular, asymptotically flat black hole supported by a Dehnen-type matter halo. Gravitational perturbations in this background split into two distinct axial sectors, and our analysis confirms that the presence of the halo parameter $a$ breaks the isospectrality that holds in vacuum. The dependence of the quasinormal spectrum on $a$ is moderate for the fundamental modes and even weaker for the overtones, which approach one another in the complex-frequency plane as the halo parameter increases. No enhancement or rapid growth of overtone amplitudes is observed, indicating that the halo does not induce the type of strong near-horizon effects characteristic of quantum-corrected or exotic compact objects. Overall, our results show that the dark-matter halo introduces controlled and comparatively mild modifications to the ringdown spectrum while preserving its qualitative structure.</description>

      <title>From Frame Covariance to the Swampland Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field space geometry plays a central role within the Swampland Programme, most notably in the various Distance Conjectures. However, for gravitational EFTs, this geometry is not uniquely defined: one can cast the action in many synonymous descriptions related by Weyl transformations, in which the field space metric transforms non-trivially across conformal frames. This raises a crucial question of how we are meant to think of the field space metric in view of employing the Swampland Conjectures. In this work we resolve this ambiguity by developing a fully frame-covariant framework for studying gravitational EFTs. We show that all conformal frames arise as distinct foliations of a singular higher-dimensional auxiliary geometry. Applying ADM formalism to the augmented field space, it is clear how Weyl- and unit transformations can be understood from a geometric point of view. Using this framework, we revisit the Species Scale Distance Conjecture and Sharpened Distance Conjecture, and show how the bounds derive from universal properties of gravitational EFTs under Weyl transformations. This strongly suggests that aspects of these conjectures apply to a much broader class of scalar-tensor theories and are consequences of frame covariance, rather than constraints imposed by quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Open Effective Field Theory and the Physics of Cosmological Collider Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the origin of the cosmological collider signal using the framework of open effective field theories. Focusing on the single exchange of a massive scalar field, we demonstrate that the trispectrum splits cleanly into its local and non-local components once the heavy-field propagators are decomposed in the Keldysh basis. Integrating out the massive degree of freedom yields a single-field effective field theory for the light scalar that necessarily contains both unitary operators and non-unitary contributions associated with dissipation and stochastic noise. We show that the leading local signal in parity-preserving theories arises from the unitary part of this effective field theory, whereas the non-local signal is intrinsically associated with its stochastic sector. The effective field theory coefficients themselves are a priori non-analytic in the external kinematics; however, this non-analyticity can be softened when a scale hierarchy - such as the heavy-mass expansion - is imposed, up to spurious contributions that ultimately cancel in observables. Finally, we establish a connection between the cosmological collider signal and entropy production, linking the observable non-local signal to intrinsic properties of the quantum state, including its degree of mixedness.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian threads and nonlocal computation in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in holography and quantum gravity have shown that CFTs with classical gravity duals can implement nonlocal quantum computation protocols that appear local from the bulk perspective. We examine the extent to which current prescriptions for holographic complexity support this claim, focusing on the Complexity=Volume (CV) proposal. The reformulation of CV in terms of Lorentzian threads suggests that bulk computations are performed with local gates. However, we find that the original formalism is insufficient when it comes to analyzing the complexity of subsystems and their inequalities. Specifically, standard Lorentzian threads cannot account for the negativity of `mutual complexity' and its higher-partite generalizations. To address this deficiency, we modify the Lorentzian threads program by introducing multiple flavors of threads. Our analysis reveals that an optimal solution for this new program implies the existence of additional types of gates that enable nonlocal computations in the dual CFT. We give a tentative interpretation of the multiflavor program in terms of Lorentzian `hyperthreads,' in analogy with the Riemannian case.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Time and Space in Closed Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time, space and entanglement are the main characters in this work. Their nature is still a great mystery in physics and we study here the possibility that these three phenomena are closely connected, showing how entanglement can be at the basis of the emergence of time and space within closed quantum systems. We revisit and extend the Page and Wootters theory that was originally introduced in order to describe the emergence of time through entanglement between subsystems in a globally static, quantum Universe. In the book, after providing a complete review of the salient aspects of the theory, we establish a connection with recent research on the foundations of statistical mechanics and we propose a new understanding of the thermalization process. Furthermore, we generalize the framework in order describe the spatial degree of freedom and we provide a model of 3+1 dimensional, quantum spacetime emerging from entanglement among different subsystems in a globally "timeless" and "positionless" Universe. Finally, via the Page and Wootters theory, the evolution of quantum clocks within a gravitational field is treated and a time dilation effect is obtained in agreement with the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, constraints on the Hubble parameter using multiple dark sirens have been made,relying on a galaxy catalogue, correlations between the mass and redshift distributions, or both. Those studies have typically used only significant gravitational wave candidates. In this work, we present a framework for cosmological inference that bypasses per-candidate parameter estimation, uses only detection-level information. This allows the population inference from a candidate list produced directly by a search pipeline, without additional selection cuts. Our method is particularly suited to extracting information from marginal candidates, which are essential for probing the distant universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recoiling remnants of black-hole mergers in dense environments can produce bright electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to the gravitational-wave (GW) emission. Significance assessments of such GW-EM candidates are restricted to time and sky-localisation consistency, omitting the physics governing the EM emission process. Different emission mechanisms, however, impose different observability constraints on the remnant black-hole recoil and spin, which are gravitational-wave observables. We present a statistical framework that includes such parameters. We assess the consistency of the GW190521-ZTF19abanrhr pair with two types of emission processes: a Blandford-Znajek jet closely aligned with the final spin axis and a diffusive isotropic flare. Assuming the sky-location of ZTF19abanrhr, we find these mechanisms to be respectively strongly and moderately disfavoured with log-evidences $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm jet} = -1.65$ and $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm diff} = -0.075$. Combining these with odds for a common sky-location $\Omega$ we obtain respective combined odds $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{\Omega,{\rm jet}}= -1.17$ and $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{\Omega,{\rm diff}}= +0.39$ for a true GW-EM coincidence as opposed to a random one. Our method leverages a previously unexplored evidence axis to assess GW-EM associations and constrain both the physics powering flare mechanisms and the properties of AGNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the composite models of gravity and investigate how dynamical tensor fields emerge by utilizing the functional Renormalization Group. In this paper, we consider two models: One is the fermionic theory. Another is the scalar theory. In both cases, we introduce an auxiliary tensor field corresponding to a composite field of the energy-momentum tensor by means of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We derive the flow equations for the field renormalization factors of the auxiliary tensor field and show the tensor field becomes dynamical in the infrared regime. The resulting kinetic terms are interpreted as gauge-fixed terms.</description>

      <title>Photon Dynamics and Collision Risks in Relativistic Spaceflight: A Comparative Study of Methods and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation explores the dynamics of relativistic spaceflight, focusing on the risks associated with collisions and photon interactions as a spacecraft approaches velocities near the speed of light. The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational-wave background search using data from five pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using public data from five pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), we search for a stationary, isotropic, and unpolarized nHz stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We use pulse time-of-arrival data from 121 pulsars, which is more informative than previous searches, carried out separately by the individual PTA collaborations using only their own data. For pulsars observed by more than one PTA, we employ a new "direct combination" method to merge their astrophysical models and data. This avoids the challenge of reconciling the different PTA timing models to obtain a single "best" model. A central result of our analysis is posterior probability distributions for the amplitude $A_{gw}$ and exponent $\gamma_{gw}$ of the putative SGWB energy-density spectrum, modeled as a power law in frequency. While these results are consistent with a nonzero SGWB amplitude $A_{gw}$, the statistical significance--assessed via a Bayesian odds ratio and through noise-marginalized false-alarm probabilities ($p$-values) for three different detection statistics--remains below the conventional $5\sigma$ threshold for a confident detection. We also reconstruct the inter-pulsar timing-residual correlation as a function of the angle $\theta$ between the pulsar lines of sight. This is consistent with the curve predicted by Hellings and Downs (HD).</description>

      <title>The frame-dragging vector potential on galaxy scales from DM-only Newtonian $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08703v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\% \sim 0.1\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass constraints in the context of 4-parameter dark energy equation of state and DESI DR2 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, are strongly shaped by assumptions about the dark-energy equation of state due to the well-known degeneracy between massive neutrinos and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.101$ eV ($95\%$ C.L.). This upper limit is more stringent than the DESI DR2 constraint obtained within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. From the best-fit parameters, we reconstruct the evolution of the 4pDE equation of state along with both $68\%$ and $95\%$C.L. We do not find a statistically significant phantom-crossing at $z \sim 0.5$, consistent with the conclusion from the DESI collaboration; at higher redshifts, the reconstructed $w(z)$ follows the CPL evolution and deviates only at low redshift. Additionally we also find reduction in $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}=-7.3$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>The Radius of PSR J0437-4715 from NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data have been used to estimate the masses and radii of the rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, PSR J0437$-$4715, PSR J1231$-$1411, and PSR J0614$-$3329, sometimes in joint analyses with X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) data. These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\pm 0.044~M_\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\sim 1.4~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451. We discuss the implications of this measurement for the equation of state of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Finite size effects in DBI and Born-Infeld for screened spherically symmetric objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite size effects on the linear response of spherically symmetric objects in Born-Infeld (BI) electromagnetism and Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field theories. Previous works show that the linear response coefficients for a point-like source vanish for odd multipoles above the dipole, a feature that resembles the vanishing of Love numbers for black holes. This work goes beyond the point-like idealisation and considers a sphere of finite radius. We find that the vanishing of the linear response coefficients ceases as they acquire a correction due to the finite size of the object. This introduces a hierarchy between the even and odd multipoles of the response coefficients determined by the separation of scales between the radius of the sphere and the screening scale of non-linearities. From a phenomenological viewpoint, the hierarchy between the odd and even multipoles would give access to the screening scale and the object's radius by measuring the behaviour of the potentials at infinity.</description>

      <title>The Maxwell equations on full sub-extremal and extremal Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the Maxwell equations in the exterior region of Kerr black hole spacetimes. The equations are formulated for components of the Maxwell field relative to the algebraically special frame of Kerr, with the unknowns treated as tensorial quantities associated with a non-integrable horizontal distribution. The extremal Maxwell components decouple into Teukolsky equations, whereas the middle Maxwell components form a coupled system of transport and elliptic equations. Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|&lt;=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon.
  In the sub-extremal |a|&lt;M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations.
  In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon. Our boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations remain, therefore, conditional. We show that the complicated dynamics of the extremal components at the event horizon is inherited by the middle components; in particular, we uncover novel conservation laws for the middle components of axisymmetric solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. These models are described by $f\left( R,\mathcal{G}\right) =f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $ theory of gravity. They are equivalent to models linear in the Ricci scalar $R$ and in the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$ with one nonminimally coupled scalar field without kinetic term. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations to investigate the cosmological evolution. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe. Moreover, we discuss the initial value problem for theory to be cosmologically viable. Finally, the effects of the cold dark matter in cosmic evolution are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The multi-mode acoustic gravitational wave experiment (MAGE) is a high-frequency gravitational wave detection experiment featuring cryogenic quartz bulk acoustic wave resonators operating as sensitive strain antennas in the MHz regime. After 61 days of non-continuous data collection, we present bounds on the observable merger rate density of primordial black hole binary systems of chirp mass $1.2\times10^{-4}M_\odot&lt;\mathcal{M}&lt;1.7\times10^{-9}M_\odot$. The maximum achieved limit on the merger rate density is $\mathcal{R}&gt;1.3\times10^{18}~\mathrm{kpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ which corresponds to constraining yearly mergers to a distance of reach on the order of the solar system, or $1.0\times10^{-6}$ kpc during the observational period. In addition, we exclude significantly rare and strong events similar to those observed in previous predecessor experiments as non-gravitational background signals, utilising coincident analysis between multiple detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by a two-level atom freely falling into a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP)-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We derive analytic expressions for the atom's excitation probability with simultaneous emission of a scalar quantum and observe that it satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle when compared to the excitation probability induced by a uniformly accelerating mirror, motivated by studies [10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.071301] and [10.1073/pnas.1807703115]. Adopting an open-quantum-system framework, we then compute the horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for the GUP-corrected spacetime and find that it reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law, with corrections characteristic of GUP effects. These results underline the robustness of thermal radiation processes near horizons and the universality of entropy corrections in quantum-improved black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of gravitationally induced adiabatic particle production offers an alternative approach to exploring the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, existing models generally lack a well-defined field-action formulation. This article aims to establish a suitable Lagrangian formulation consistent with the framework of particle creation. A general form of action is considered for this purpose. The corresponding field equations in comparison with those commonly used in the particle creation formalism leads to some specific form of the Lagrangian, which further constrains the form of the particle creation models. We perform the phase space stability analysis of the constrained model and compared with observational data. Our result shows that the constrained model is capable of explaining the cosmic evolution from the radiation to the late-time cosmic acceleration if the model parameter lies within the range $1/3 &lt; \beta &lt; 2/3$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Comparing a Compact-Binary Mass-Shell Model with Select Observed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work, coalescing compact binaries (CCBs) were modeled as a rotating and contracting compact mass shell, providing an alternative effective representation to the state-of-the-art effective-one-body approach. Using a variational methodology, the Laplace-Beltrami formulation of the Ricci tensor was applied to a Kerr metric Ansatz, and the corresponding energy density $T_{00}$ of the CCB mass shell was obtained via the Einstein field equations. At the time of coalescence $t_C$, the resulting surface energy depends on the reduced mass $\mu$, the symmetric mass ratio $\alpha$, and the normalized orbital spin velocity of the CCB. In this work, we evaluate the radiated energy predicted by this variational approach for 45 select gravitational wave (GW) events from the O1--O4 runs, and compare these values with those inferred from observational catalogs, either directly or via the total-minus-remnant mass difference. For 38 of the 45 events analyzed, the predicted radiated energies agree with observationally inferred values within the reported uncertainties, with 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ (mean $0.942$, median $0.955$). Three events exhibit ratios in the range $0.721\sim0.779$, one event yields a ratio of $0.466$, and for the remaining events the radiated energy is either unconstrained or inaccessible due to undocumented total-minus-remnant mass differences. These results indicate that the analytical approximation captures, for the most part, the leading-order energy scaling of compact binary mergers, while also suggesting clear avenues for further systematic improvement, including incorporating post-Newtonian corrections due to e.g. a non-zero eccentricity or combined tidal deformability.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is secondarily and inevitably induced by the primordial curvature perturbations beyond the first order of the cosmological perturbation theory. We analytically calculate the integration kernel of the power spectrum of the induced GWs, which is the universal part independent of the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, in the radiation-dominated era and in the matter-dominated era. We derive fully analytic expressions of the GW spectrum when possible. As a minor update, we study the case of the top-hat function as the spectrum of the curvature perturbations. We also discuss generalization in the presence of multiple cosmological eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <title>Encoding the Einstein Equations into an Algebraic Commutator Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the structure of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is such that unimodular (trace-free) gravity can be consistently represented as an algebraic condition on the symmetric product space of 2-forms. This condition states that the commutator between the Riemann tensor and the Hodge dual must be equal to the commutator between the Kulkarni-Nomizu product of the energy-momentum and the metric with the Hodge dual; symbolically, $[\text{Riem}, \star] = 4\pi [T\KN g, \star]$. We show that this condition is equivalent to the trace-free field equations, that the right-hand-side vanishes if and only if the energy-momentum tensor vanishes (recovering the appropriate Einstein spacetime limit) and that this condition can be solved for electrovacuum in the spherically symmetric ansatz to yield Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter uniquely. This analysis suggests that the conceptual distinction between unimodular gravity and General Relativity is one of emphasis on how irreducible representations of the Riemann tensor are constrained by the existence of energy-momentum and the associated field equations.</description>

      <title>Einstein gravity extended by a scale covariant scalar field with Bekenstein term and dynamical mass generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under carefully chosen assumptions a single general relativistic scalar field is able to induce MOND-like dynamics in the weak field approximation of the Einstein frame (gauge) and to modify the light cone structure accordingly. This is shown by a Lagrangian model formulated in the framework of integrable Weyl geometry. It contains a Bekenstein-type (``aquadratic'') term and a second order term generating additional mass energy for the scalar field. Both are switched on only if the gradient of the scalar field is spacelike and below a MOND-typical threshold, like in the superfluid model of Berezhiani/Khoury. The mass term induces non-negligible energy and pressures of the scalar field and leads to gravitational light deflection compatible with MOND-ian free fall trajectories. In the weak field (Newton-Milgrom) approximation the Bekenstein term implies a deep MOND equation for the scalar field. In this model the external field effect of the MOND approach has to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>Regularized Black Hole Solution from a New String Cloud Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of regular black hole solutions supported by the novel Letelier-Alencar string cloud and regularized through a rational Dagum-type distribution. The regulator smooths the matter profile and ensures finite curvature invariants, yielding a geometry that interpolates between a string-cloud exterior and an anti--de Sitter core. We analyze the energy conditions, identifying where the null, weak, dominant and strong conditions hold or fail across the core and exterior. The parameter space for horizon formation is mapped and the thermodynamic propertie -- mass, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity -- are derived; notably, the entropy depends only on the regularization scale while the string parameter modifies temperature and heat capacity. Employing R\'enyi non-extensive entropy and the topological thermodynamics approach, we show the non-extensive deformation stabilizes the system and removes the standard phase transition. Finally, we compute the shadow radius and derive constraints compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A* and M87*.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations on an averaged background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In relativistic cosmology, the formation of nonlinear inhomogeneities can induce non-negligible backreaction on late-time expansion. Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.</description>

      <title>A theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework for black-hole spectroscopy: a case study on GW250114 in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful probe of strong-field gravity in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $\zeta$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $\zeta$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $\zeta$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality, and a curvature-driven pre-compactness result. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Shapes and orientations of massive halos in the statistically anisotropic universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how statistical anisotropy (SA) in matter distributions affects the distributions of shapes and orientations of cluster-sized halos, using cosmological $N$-body simulations that incorporate SA. While the three-dimensional halo shape parameters show little dependence on SA, we find that halo orientations are significantly influenced, with halos tending to align either perpendicular or parallel to the SA direction. This SA-induced alignment becomes more prominent for more massive halos. We also study other vector quantities associated with the dynamics of halos, such as bulk velocity and angular momentum vectors. We find that their dependences on the SA are smaller than those of the orientation vectors. Our findings suggest that observational measurements of projected halo shapes derived from galaxy cluster-galaxy lensing could provide a novel probe of SA in the universe.</description>

      <title>Assessing Universal Relations for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars: Insights from an Interpretable Deep Learning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions; results are shown to be comparable to quasiparticle bound states in gapped Dirac materials. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion field {\psi} becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion field strength. For sufficiently large {\psi} and low velocity, the collision of two m = 1 vortices results in a pseudostable m= 2 bound state that eventually becomes unstable and decays back into two m= 1 vortices. For large {\psi} and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.</description>

      <title>Holography vs. Scale Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we point out a contradiction between holography and scale-separated AdS (i.e. parametrically large mass gap) in string theory, making the standard assumption that the holographic CFT describes the IR degrees of freedom on a brane that decouple from gravity. We show that the CFT can only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS satisfies a certain criterion. Namely, there must exist a scalar field trajectory that follows the gradient of the scalar potential to the asymptotic region of the scalar field space in which limit $\partial_\phi\ln(V)\partial_\phi\ln(\Lambda_s)\leq2/(d-2)$, where $\Lambda_s$ is the quantum gravity cut-off. This condition, which generically implies lack of scale-separation, is satisfied in the standard examples of AdS/CFT. However, proposed attempts at achieving scale separation, such as DGKT, employ scalar potentials that violate this condition. We therefore conclude that the CFT duals of DGKT vacua cannot exist in string theory. Barring fine-tuning, our conclusions apply to other Ricci-flat flux compactifications including the KKLT scenario which relies on scale separation to obtain a metastable de Sitter uplift.</description>

      <title>Sco X-1 as a continuous gravitational waves source: modelling the secular evolution using MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform and progenitor parameters. We model the spin of the neutron star by the accretion torque and the gravitational-wave torque, considering two mechanisms for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the latter: magnetic mountains and crustal breakage deformation. Both torques are intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA, starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G (Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs, with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on $\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust does not break. For $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with $M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70% all crusts break. In some systems, the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase. If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies in $\approx 150000[\varepsilon /10^{-5}]^{-2/5}$ years. We estimate the current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability increases substantially - to around 41% - with 3G detectors.</description>

      <title>A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution</title>

Abstract: Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>
