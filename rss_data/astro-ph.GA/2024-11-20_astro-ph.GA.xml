      <title>The host galaxies of radio-loud quasars at z&gt;5 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between radio-jets and quasar host galaxies plays a paramount role in quasar/galaxy co-evolution. However, very little has been known so far about this interaction at very high-z. Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in Band 7 and Band 3 of six radio-loud quasars' host galaxies at $z &gt; 5$. We recover [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and underlying dust continuum emission at $&gt;2\sigma$ for five sources, while we obtain upper limits for the CO(6-5) emission line and continuum for the remaining source. At the spatial resolution of our observations ($\sim$1.0"-1.4"), we do not recover perturbed/extended morphologies or kinematics, signatures of potential mergers. These galaxies already host large quantities of gas, with [CII]-based star formation rates of $30-400 M_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$. Building their radio/sub-mm spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we find that in at least four cases the 1mm continuum intensity arises from a combination of synchrotron and dust emission, with an initial estimation of synchrotron contribution at 300 GHz of $\gtrsim$10%. We compare the properties of the sources inspected here with a large collection of radio-quiet sources from the literature, as well as a sample of radio-loud quasars from previous studies, at comparable redshift. We recover a potential mild decrease in $L_{\rm [CII]}$ for the radio-loud sources, which might be due to a suppression of the cool gas emission due to the radio-jets. We do not find any [CII]-emitting companion galaxy candidate around the five radio-loud quasars observed in Band 7: given the depth of our dataset, this result is still consistent with that observed around radio-quiet quasars. Further higher-spatial resolution observations, over a larger frequency range, of high-z radio-loud quasars hosts will allow for a better understanding of the physics of such sources.</description>

      <title>Mining for Protoclusters at $z\sim4$ from Photometric Datasets with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoclusters are high-$z$ overdense regions that will evolve into clusters of galaxies by $z=0$, making them ideal for studying galaxy evolution expected to be accelerated by environmental effects. However, it has been challenging to identify protoclusters beyond $z=3$ only by photometry due to large redshift uncertainties, hindering statistical study. To tackle the issue, we develop a new deep-learning-based protocluster detection model, PCFNet, which considers a protocluster as a point cloud. To detect protoclusters at $z\sim4$ using only optical broad-band photometry, we train and evaluate PCFNet with mock $g$-dropout galaxies based on the N-body simulation with the semi-analytic model. We use the sky distribution, $i$-band magnitude, $(g-i)$ color, and the redshift probability density function surrounding a target galaxy on the sky. PCFNet achieves to detect five times more protocluster member candidates while maintaining high purity (recall $=7.5\pm0.2$%, precision $=44\pm1$%) than conventional methods. Moreover, PCFNet is able to detect more progenitors ($M_\mathrm{halo}^{z=0}=10^{14-14.5}\,M_\odot$) that are less massive than supermassive clusters like the Coma cluster. We apply PCFNet to the observational photometric dataset of the HSC-SSP Deep/UltraDeep layer ($\sim17\mathrm{\,deg^2}$) and detect $121$ protocluster candidates at $z\sim4$. We find the rest-UV luminosities of our protocluster member candidates are brighter than those of field galaxies, which is consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the quenching of satellite galaxies depends on both the core galaxy's halo mass at $z\sim4$ and accumulated mass until $z=0$ in the simulation. PCFNet is very flexible and can find protoclusters at other redshifts or in future extensive surveys by Euclid, LSST, and Roman.</description>

      <title>MUSEQuBES: Connecting HI absorption with Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z \approx 3.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of HI absorption around 96 lya emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx3.3$ (median lya luminosity $\approx10^{42}$ erg.s$^{-1}$). These LAEs were identified within 8 MUSE fields, each $1'\times1'$ on the sky and centered on a bright background quasar, as part of the MUSEQuBES survey. Using Voigt profile fitting for all HI absorbers detected within $\pm500$ km.$s^{-1}$ of these LAEs, we compiled a catalog of 800 HI absorption components. Our analysis shows that HI absorption is enhanced near the LAEs compared to the IGM. However, no trend is found between the column densities of HI absorbers and their impact parameters from the LAEs (spanning $\approx54$ to 260 pkpc). Additionally, all galaxies associated with Lyman-limit systems have impact parameters $&gt;50$ pkpc from the quasar sightlines, suggesting that true absorber-hosts may be too faint to detect. The LAEs show an overall HI covering fraction (fc(HI)) of $\approx88\%$ for a threshold logN(HI)$=15$. Notably, at the same threshold, the pairs/group LAEs exhibit a $100\%$ HI covering fraction out to $\approx 250$ pkpc. In contrast, isolated LAEs consistently show a lower fc(HI) of $\approx80\%$. This environmental influence on fc(HI) is also evident up to $\approx 300$ km.$s^{-1}$ in differential bins of line-of-sight velocity. We find an anti-correlation between fc(HI) and the rest-frame lya-emission equivalent width (ew). Based on the lya-shell model, this could imply that gas-rich galaxies tend to reside in gas-rich environments or that the higher EW LAEs are more efficient at ionizing their surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Bias Parameter from Angular Power Spectra: Bridging Between Galaxies and Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the modeling of the gravitational wave (GW) bias parameter by bridging a connection between simulated GW sources and galaxies in low redshift galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISExSCOS (WISC). We study this connection by creating a mock GW catalog, populating galaxy surveys with binary black holes (BBHs) for different scenarios of the GW occupation fraction (or selection function) as a function of the galaxy stellar mass. We probe the observable consequences of this connection by exploring the spatial clustering of the GW sources in terms of the GW bias parameter. We consider a phenomenological broken power law model for the selection function, with a potential turnover $M_{K}$ at high stellar mass ($10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial model) where the star formation efficiency begins to drop. We vary the parameters of the selection function and find that generically the GW bias increases as $M_{K}$ increases (and gets suppressed as $M_{K}$ decreases). The change in the GW bias parameter shows a maximum change of about $30\%$ for different scenarios explored in this work in comparison to the galaxy bias. Future measurements of the GW bias can help constrain $M_{K}$ and the slopes of the selection function and thus offer insights into the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Disc asymmetry characterisation in JWST-observed galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique using Fourier series and Laguerre polynomials to represent morphological features of disc galaxies. To demonstrate the utility of this technique, we study the evolution of asymmetry in a sample of disc galaxies drawn from the Extended Groth Strip and imaged by the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey as well as archival HST observations. We measure disc asymmetry as the amplitude of the of the m = 1 Fourier harmonic for galaxies within redshift ranges of 1 &lt; z &lt; 4. We show that when viewed in shorter rest frame wavelengths, disc galaxies have a higher asymmetry as the flux is dominated by star forming regions. We find generally low asymmetry at rest frame infrared wavelengths, where our metric tracks asymmetry in morphological features such as bars and spiral arms. We show that higher mass galaxies have lower asymmetry and vice versa. Higher asymmetry in lower mass galaxies comes from lower mass galaxies (typically) having higher star formation rates. We measure the relation between disc galaxy asymmetry and redshift and find no conclusive relationship between them. We demonstrate the utility of the Fourier-Laguerre technique for recovering physically informative asymmetry measurements as compared to rotational asymmetry measurements. We also release the software pipeline and quantitative analysis for each galaxy.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: An environmental study of Type Ia supernovae using host galaxy image decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second data release of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility has provided a homogeneous sample of 3628 SNe Ia with photometric and spectral information. This unprecedented sample size enables us to better explore our currently tentative understanding of the dependence of host environment on SN Ia properties. In this paper, we make use of two-dimensional image decomposition to model the host galaxies of SNe Ia. We model elliptical galaxies as well as disk/spiral galaxies with or without central bulges and bars. This allows for the categorisation of SN Ia based on their morphological host environment, as well as the extraction of intrinsic galaxy properties corrected for both cosmological and atmospheric effects. We find that although this image decomposition technique leads to a significant bias towards elliptical galaxies in our final sample of galaxies, the overall results are robust. By successfully modelling 728 host galaxies, we find that the photometric properties of SNe Ia found in disks and in elliptical galaxies, correlate fundamentally differently with their host environment. We identified strong linear relations between light-curve stretch and our model-derived galaxy colour for both the elliptical (16.8$\sigma$) and disk (5.1$\sigma$) subpopulations of SNe Ia. Lower stretch SNe Ia are found in redder environments, which we identify as an age/metallicity effect. Within the subpopulation of SNe Ia found in disk containing galaxies, we find a significant linear trend (6.1$\sigma$) between light-curve stretch and model-derived local $r$-band surface brightness, which we link to the age/metallicity gradients found in disk galaxies. SN Ia colour shows little correlation with host environment as seen in the literature. We identify a possible dust effect in our model-derived surface brightness (3.3$\sigma$), for SNe Ia in disk galaxies.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Nature of Little Red Dots: Constraints on AGN and Stellar Contributions from PRIMER MIRI Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a large population of compact, red galaxies at $z&gt;4$ known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 95 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from $1-18\ \mu$m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning $\sim$2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The black hole and stellar masses inferred from the hybrid model lead to highly overmassive black holes even exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals in Milky Way Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consequence of a non-zero occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies is that these MBHs can become residents of larger galaxy halos via hierarchical merging and tidal stripping. Depending on the parameters of their orbits and original hosts, some of these MBHs will merge with the central supermassive black hole in the larger galaxy. We examine four cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies to study the demographics of the black hole mergers which originate from dwarf galaxies. Approximately half of these mergers have mass ratios less than 0.04, which we categorize as intermediate mass ratio inspirals, or IMRIs. Inspiral durations range from 0.5 - 8 Gyr, depending on the compactness of the dwarf galaxy. Approximately half of the inspirals may become more circular with time, while the eccentricity of the remainder does not evolve. Overall, IMRIs in Milky Way-like galaxies are a significant class of black hole merger that can be detected by LISA, and must be prioritized for waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>COALAS III: The ATCA CO(1-0) look at the growth and death of H$\alpha$ emitters in the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain CO(1-0) molecular gas measurements with ATCA on a sample of 43 spectroscopically confirmed H$\alpha$ emitters in the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$ and investigate the relation between their star formation and cold gas reservoirs as a function of environment. We achieve a CO(1-0) detection rate of $\sim23\pm12\%$ with 10 dual CO(1-0) and H$\alpha$ detections at $10&lt;\log M_{*}/M_\odot&lt;11.5$. In addition, we obtain upper limits for the remaining sources. In terms of total gas fractions ($F_{gas}$), our sample is divided into two different regimes with a steep transition at $\log M_{*}/M_\odot\approx10.5$. Galaxies below that threshold have gas fractions that in some cases are close to unity, indicating that their gas reservoir has been replenished by inflows from the cosmic web. However, objects at $\log M_{*}/M_\odot&gt;10.5$ display significantly lower gas fractions and are dominated by AGN (12 out of 20). Stacking results yield $F_{gas}\approx0.55$ for massive emitters excluding AGN, and $F_{gas}\approx0.35$ when examining only AGN candidates. Furthermore, depletion times show that most H$\alpha$ emitters may become passive by $1&lt;z&lt;1.6$, concurrently with the surge and dominance of the red sequence in the most massive clusters. Our analyses suggest that galaxies in the outskirts of the protocluster have larger molecular-to-stellar mass ratios and lower star formation efficiencies than in the core. However, star formation across the protocluster remains consistent with the main sequence, indicating that evolution is primarily driven by the depletion of the gas reservoir towards the inner regions. We discuss the relative importance of in-/outflow processes in regulating star formation during the early phases of cluster assembly and conclude that a combination of feedback and overconsumption may be responsible for the rapid cold gas depletion these objects endure.</description>

      <title>A slow spin to win -- the gradual evolution of the proto-Galaxy to the old disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational studies are identifying stars thought to be remnants from the earliest stages of the hierarchical mass assembly of the Milky Way, referred to as the proto-Galaxy. We use red giant stars with kinematics and [$\alpha$/M] and [M/H] estimates from Gaia DR3 data to investigate the relationship between azimuthal velocity and metallicity, aiming to understand the transition from a chaotic proto-Galaxy to a well-ordered, rotating (old) disc-like population. To analyse the structure of the data in [M/H]-v$_\phi$ space for both high- and low-$\alpha$ samples with carefully defined $\alpha$-separation, we develop a model with two Gaussian components in v$_\phi$: one representing a disc-like population and the other a halo-like population. This model is designed to capture the conditional distribution P(v$_\phi$ $\mid$ [M/H]) with a 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model with fixed azimuthal velocities means and standard deviations. To quantify the spin-up of the high-$\alpha$ disc population, we extend this two-component model by allowing the mean velocity and velocity dispersion to vary between the spline knots across the metallicity range used. We also compare our findings with existing literature using traditional Gaussian Mixture Modelling in bins of [M/H] and investigate using orbital circularity instead of azimuthal velocity. Our findings show that the metal-poor high-$\alpha$ disc gradually spins up across [M/H] $\sim$ -1.7 to -1.0, while the low-$\alpha$ sample exhibits a sharp transition at [M/H] $\sim$ -1.0. This latter result is due to the accreted debris dominating the metal-poor end, underscoring the critical role of [$\alpha$/M] selection in studying the (old) disc evolution of the Milky Way. These results indicate that the proto-Galaxy underwent a slow, monotonic spin-up phase rather than a rapid, dramatic spin-up at [M/H] $\sim$ -1.0, as previously inferred.</description>

      <title>Moderate Influence of Halo Spin on Stellar Mass Distributions in Dwarf and Massive Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate halo spins for HI-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey using a semi-analytic approach, examining the relationship between halo spin and stellar surface density. Our findings reveal an inverse correlation in both low- and high-mass galaxy samples, with stellar surface density decreasing as halo spin increases. This trend highlights the pivotal role of halo spin in galaxy evolution and suggests a universal formation scenario: high-spin halos, accompanied by high-spin accreted gas, retain angular momentum, preventing gas from efficiently condensing in the galactic center and thus suppressing star formation. Consequently, weak feedback redistributes gas to the halo outskirts without significant expulsion. The shallower central gravitational potential in high-spin halos promotes outward stellar migration, leading to more extended stellar distributions and lower stellar surface densities.</description>

      <title>Halo Spin Dependence on Environment for HI-bearing galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the semi-analytic method, we compute halo spins for a substantial sample of HI-bearing galaxies observed in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey. Our statistical analysis reveals a correlation between halo spin and environment, although the trend is subtle. On average, galaxies exhibit a decreasing halo spin tendency in denser environments. This observation contrasts with previous results from $N$-body simulations in the Lambda cold dark matter framework. The discrepancy may be attributed to environmental gas stripping, leading to an underestimation of halo spins in galaxies in denser environments, or to baryonic processes that significantly alter the original dark matter halo spins, deviating from previous $N$-body simulation findings.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Specific Star Formation Rate Is Independent of Halo Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing ALFALFA HI data, we investigate the relationship between specific star formation rate (sSFR) and halo spin across various star-forming galaxies. Our analysis reveals no significant correlation between sSFR and halo spin, irrespective of the galactic environment. Previous research suggests that high-spin halos tend to harbor extended, low-density stellar distributions due to suppressed gas cooling and star formation. However, unlike galaxy size and density, sSFR may primarily reflect the current star-forming state rather than long-term history, indicating potential independence from halo spin.</description>

      <title>Mass evolution of broad line regions to explain the luminosity variability of broad H$\alpha$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, an oversimplified model is proposed for the first time to explain the different variability trends in the observed broad H$\alpha$ emission line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ and in the TDE model determined bolometric luminosity $L_{bol}(t)$ in the known TDE ASASSN-14li. Considering broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk related to accreted materials onto central black hole in TDEs, mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be determined by the maximum mass $M_{BLRs,0}$ of central BLRs minus the corresponding accreted mass in a TDE. Meanwhile, through the simple linear dependence of Broad Balmer emission line luminosity on mass of BLRs, the mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be applied to describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$. Although the proposed model is oversimplified with only one free model parameter $M_{BLRs,0}$, the model with $M_{BLRs,0}\sim0.02{\rm M_\odot}$ can be applied to well describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li. Meanwhile, the oversimplified model can also be applied to roughly describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14ae. The reasonable descriptions to the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-14ae indicate the oversimplified model with only one free model parameter is probably efficient enough to describe mass evolutions of $M_{BLRs}$ related to central accreted debris in TDEs.</description>

      <title>Kinetic tomography of the Galactic plane within 1.25 kiloparsecs from the Sun. The interstellar flows revealed by HI and CO line emission and 3D dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reconstruction of the line-of-sight motions of the local interstellar medium (ISM) based on the combination of a state-of-the-art model of the three-dimensional dust density distribution within 1.25 kpc from the Sun and the HI and CO line emission within Galactic latitudes $|b| &lt; 5^{\circ}$. We use the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method to match the plane-of-the-sky 3D dust distribution across distances with the atomic and molecular line emission. We identify a significant correlation between the 3D dust model and the line emission. We employ this correlation to assign line-of-sight velocities to the dust across density channels and produce a face-on map of the local ISM radial motions with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). We find that most of the material in the 3D dust model follows the large-scale pattern of Galactic rotation; however, we also report local departures from the rotation pattern with standard deviations of 12.1 and 6.1 km/s for the HI and CO line emission, respectively. The mean kinetic energy densities of these streaming motions are around 0.68 and 0.18 eV/cm$^{3}$ from either gas tracer. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the velocity field, these values are within a factor of a few of the total kinetic energy density. These kinetic energy values are roughly comparable to other energy densities, thus confirming the near-equipartition introduced by the feedback loops connecting the physical processes in the local ISM. Yet, we find energy and momentum overdensities of around a factor of ten concentrated in the Radcliffe Wave, the Split, and other local density structures. Although we do not find evidence of the Local Spiral Arm impact in these overdensities, their distribution suggests the influence of other large-scale effects that, in addition to supernova feedback, shape the energy distribution in the Solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution during Molecular Cloud Formation Triggered by an Interstellar Shock Wave: Dependence on Shock Parameters and Comparison with Molecular Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate chemistry in the compression layer behind the interstellar shock waves, where molecular cloud formation starts. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of converging flows of atomic gas with shock parameters of inclination between the interstellar magnetic field and the shock wave, pre-shock density, and shock velocity. Then we derive 1D mean-flow models, along which we calculate a detailed gas-grain chemical reaction network as a post process with various chemical parameters, i.e. cosmic-ray ionization rate, abundances of PAHs, and metals in the gas phase. While carbon chains reach their peak abundances when atomic carbon is dominant in the pseudo-time-dependent models of molecular clouds, such behavior is less significant in our models since the visual extinction of the compression layer is low ($\lesssim 1$ mag) when atomic carbon is abundant. Carbon chains, CN, and HCN increase at $A_V \gtrsim 1$ mag, where the gas-phase C/O ratio increases due to water ice formation. Shock parameters affect the physical structure and the evolutional timescale of the compression layer, and thus molecular evolution. Carbon chains are more abundant in models with higher post-shock density and slower gas accumulation. We calculate molecular column densities in the compression layer and compare them with the observations of diffuse and translucent clouds, which show reasonable agreement for water ice, carbon chains, and HCO$^+$. The observed variation of their column densities could be due to the difference in shock parameters and chemical parameters. The column density of CN is overestimated, for which we discuss possible reasons.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas stratification and disturbed kinematics in the Seyfert galaxy MCG-05-23-16 revealed by JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the processes that drive the morphology and kinematics of molecular gas in galaxies is crucial for comprehending star formation and, ultimately, galaxy evolution. Using data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the behavior of the warm molecular gas at temperatures of hundreds of Kelvin and the cold molecular gas at tens of Kelvin in the galaxy MCG$-$05$-$23$-$16, which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this spheroidal galaxy, classified in the optical as S0, show a dust lane resembling a nuclear spiral and a surrounding ring. These features are also detected in CO(2$-$1) and H2, and their morphologies and kinematics are consistent with rotation plus local inward gas motions along the kinematic minor axis in the presence of a nuclear bar. The H2 transitions 0-0 S(3), 0-0 S(4), and 0-0 S(5), which trace warmer and more excited gas, show more disrupted kinematics than 0-0 S(1) and 0-0 S(2), including clumps of high-velocity dispersion (of up to $\sim$ 160 km/s), in regions devoid of CO(2$-$1). The kinematics of one of these clumps, located at $\sim$ 350 pc westward from the nucleus, are consistent with outflowing gas, possibly driven by localized star formation traced by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 11.3 ${\mu}$m. Overall, we observe a stratification of the molecular gas, with the colder gas located in the nuclear spiral, ring, and connecting arms, while most warmer gas with higher velocity-dispersion fills the inter-arm space. The compact jet, approximately 200 pc in size, detected with Very Large Array (VLA) observations, does not appear to significantly affect the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas, possibly due to its limited intersection with the molecular gas disc.</description>

      <title>Investigating the vertical distribution of the disk as a function of radial action: Results from simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has established a relationship between radial action and scale height in Galactic disks, unveiling a correlation between radial and vertical heating. This finding poses a challenge to our existing comprehension of heating theories and consequently encodes crucial insights into the formation and heating history of Galactic disks. In this study, we perform N-body simulations with the aim of verifying the existence of this correlation between radial action and scale height, thereby enhancing our comprehension of the heating history of Galactic disks. We find that the relationship between radial action and scale height in our simulations can be described by the same functional form observed in previous work. Furthermore, the relationships derived from our simulations align well with those of the Galactic thin disk. However, they do not coincide with the inner thick disk but exhibit a rough correspondence with the outer thick disk, suggesting the possibility that additional heating mechanisms may be required to explain the inner thick disk. We also find that the mean radial action and scale height undergo rapid increases during the initial stages of the simulation, yet remain relatively unchanged as the disk evolves further. By tracing example particles, we uncover a correlation between radial and vertical heating in our simulation: as a particle in the disk gains or loses radial action, its vertical motion tends to oscillate on a more or less extended orbit, accompanied by a tendency to migrate outward or inward, respectively. The massive, long-lasting particles in our simulation contribute to disk heating by solely enhancing the rate of increase in scale height with radial action, while maintaining the functional form that describes the relationship between these two variables.</description>

      <title>CHANG-ES XXXV: Cosmic Ray Transport and Magnetic Field Structure of NGC 3556 at 3 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio halos of edge-on galaxies are crucial for investigating cosmic ray propagation and magnetic field structures in galactic environments. We present VLA C-configuration S-band (2--4 GHz) observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 3556, a target from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). We estimate the thermal contribution to the radio emission from a combination of the H$\alpha$ and mid-IR data, and employ Rotation Measure Synthesis to reveal the magnetic field structures. In our data, NGC 3556 exhibits a box-like radio halo extending nearly 7 kpc from the galactic plane. The scale height of the total S-band intensity in the halo is $1.68\pm 0.29$ kpc, while that of the non-thermal intensity is $1.93\pm 0.28$ kpc. Fitting the data to a 1-D cosmic-ray transport model, we find advection to describe the cosmic-ray propagation within the halo better than diffusion, with advection speeds of $245 \pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$ and $205 \pm 25$ km s$^{-1}$ above and below the disk, respectively. The magnetic field is detected patchily across the galaxy, displaying a toroidal configuration in the rotation measure map. The mean equipartition magnetic field strength is approximately $8.3\ \mu$G in the disk and $4.5\ \mu$G in the halo. In addition, a bubble-like structure extends nearly 3~kpc into the southern halo, aligned with the polarized intensity and H$\alpha$ image, suggestive of superwinds generated by recent star formation feedback in the nuclear region.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dark Matter Halo Masses in Simulated Galaxy Clusters with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting $\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}_{*}$) in simulated galaxy clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Dust Emission within the Orion Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, $\beta$. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at $ \lambda &gt; 2$ mm implying non-constant indices on scales $\gtrsim$ 0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with NOEMA from 2.9 mm to 3.6 mm and ALMA-ACA in Band 4 (1.9 -- 2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6 -- 1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of $\sim 0.02 - 0.08$ pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with $\beta \approx -0.16 - 1.45$, which are notably lower than the $\beta$ values of $&gt; 1.3$ measured for these sources on $0.08$ pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multi-scale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Quenching of Galaxies at Cosmic Noon: Understanding the Effect of Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to identify quiescent galaxies in the 2-deg$^2$ COSMOS field at $z \sim 3.1$ and analyze their environment. Using data from the ODIN survey and COSMOS2020 catalog, we identify 24 massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) with stellar masses $\geq 10^{10.6}$ and derive their star formation histories and quenching timescales using SED fitting with BAGPIPES. Voronoi-based density maps trace local and large-scale environments using Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters and photometric galaxies. Results indicate uniformly short quenching timescales ($&lt;$500 Myr) independent of environmental density, suggesting rapid internal mechanisms such as AGN feedback dominate over environmental factors. MQGs do not correlate with protoclusters or filaments, although some are near gas-rich filaments but show no rejuvenation. These findings suggest quenching at high redshift is driven primarily by internal processes rather than environmental interactions.</description>

      <title>RR Lyrae Stars in Intermediate-age Magellanic Clusters: Membership Probabilities and Delay Time Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have challenged our canonical view of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars as tracers of exclusively old populations ($\gtrsim10$~Gyr) by proposing a fraction of these stars to be of intermediate ages ($\sim$2-5~Gyr). Since it is currently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars, our goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age clusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We used the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search for RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion and photometric distance we obtained a list of 302 RRL stars associated with Magellanic clusters. Of these, 23 RRL are likely members of 10 intermediate-age clusters: 3 and 7 in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, respectively. By modelling the inferred expectation values of the number of RRL stars per cluster, we inferred the delay time distribution of the RRL in three age ranges. For the old population ($&gt;8$~Gyr) we find $2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$. For the young (1-2 Gyr) and intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) populations we find rates of $0.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ and $0.27^{+0.1}_{-0.09}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$, respectively. While radial velocities are necessary for definitively confirming cluster memberships, the high-probability list of intermediate-age RRL stars presented here offers a promising opportunity for the first direct confirmation of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the flat- and isothermal-core configurations. We show analytically how our density profile satisfies these conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We demonstrate the versatility of our profile by putting it into the context of idealized N-body simulations and show that it provides excellent representations for both density and velocity dispersion structures of the simulation data. When an estimated fitting criterion is used to approximate the general cases, such as in cosmological simulations, the resulting regressions maintain their goodness of fit in both extremes, in the initial thermalization phase and the late core-collapse regime. Our density profile provides a framework for more detailed analyses of halos in different SIDM models while serving as the basis for reducing simulation needs and constructing initial conditions for deep core-collapse simulations.</description>

      <title>New Evidence for a Flux-independent Spectral Index of Sgr A* in the Near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we measure the spectral index of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) between the $H$ (1.6 $\mu$m) and $K^\prime$ (2.2 $\mu$m) broadband filters in the near-infrared (NIR), sampling over a factor $\sim 40$ in brightness, the largest range probed to date by a factor $\sim 3$. Sgr A*-NIR is highly variable, and studying the spectral index $\alpha$ (with $F_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) is essential to determine the underlying emission mechanism. For example, variations in $\alpha$ with flux may arise from shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency, changes in the distribution of electrons, or multiple concurrent emission mechanisms. We investigate potential variations of $\alpha_{H-K^\prime}$ with flux by analyzing 7 epochs (2005 to 2022) of Keck Observatory imaging observations from the Galactic Center Orbits Initiative (GCOI). We remove the flux contribution of known sources confused with Sgr A*-NIR, which can significantly impact color at faint flux levels. We interpolate between the interleaved $H$ and $K^\prime$ observations using Multi-Output Gaussian Processes. We introduce a flexible empirical model to quantify $\alpha$ variations and probe different scenarios. The observations are best fit by an $\alpha_{H-K^\prime} = - 0.50 \pm 0.08 _{\rm stat} \pm 0.17_{\rm sys}$ that is constant from $\sim 1$ mJy to $\sim 40$ mJy (dereddened 2 $\mu$m flux). We find no evidence for a flux-dependence of Sgr A*'s intrinsic spectral index. In particular, we rule out a model explaining NIR variability purely by shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency. We also constrain the presence of redder, quiescent emission from the black hole, concluding that the dereddened 2 $\mu$m flux contribution must be $\leq 0.3$ mJy at 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Shadows of generalised Hayward spacetimes : in vacuum and with plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hayward regular BH solution attempted to resolve the curvature singularity issue by entering the domain of non-singular spacetimes. Recently, Dutta Roy and Kar (Phys. Rev. D 106, 044028) expanded this solution to encompass a broader range of spacetimes. These spacetimes are constructed based on the Damour-Solodukhin prescription, which involves introducing different metric parameters in the $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components of the original Hayward line element, and are characterized by two parameters ($\sigma, \kappa$). This generalization gives rise to both known and novel regular/singular BHs as well as various types of wormhole spacetimes. In this work, we explore the spacetimes that emerge for different values of ($\sigma, \kappa$) from the generalized Hayward metric, particularly focusing on their shadows in vacuum and when surrounded by plasma. Intriguingly, we observe the presence of both photon and anti-photon spheres for certain regular spacetimes. Our study highlights the differences in the shadows of different types of regular spacetime compared to those of the singular BH derived from the generalized Hayward metric and also sheds light on the impact of plasma on the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>A Novel Bispectrum Estimator of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect using Projected Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of current and future high-resolution CMB experiments, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect has become a unique observational probe of the distribution of baryons and velocities in the Universe. In this work, we propose a novel binned bispectrum of the form temperature-temperature-density to extract the late-time kSZ effect from cleaned CMB maps. Unlike 'kSZ tomography' methods, this estimator can use any tracer of the large-scale structure density field projected along the line-of-sight and does not require individual redshifts. With our method, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\sim$100-200 for the upcoming Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 correlated with a galaxy sample from WISE that is restricted to the linear regime. We also extend galaxy modes into the non-linear regime and explore this harmonic space to show that the SNR peaks for squeezed triangles that have a short (linear) density mode and long temperature modes in harmonic space. The existing kSZ$^{2}$-density projected-fields estimator compresses the rich information contained in this bispectrum across various scales and triangle shapes. Moreover, we find that the lensing correction to our estimator's signal is relatively small. We study the dependence of this kSZ signal on $\Lambda$CDM parameters for SO and CMB-S4 and forecast initial constraints on the sum of neutrino masses while restricting to the linear galaxy bias regime. Our work illustrates the potential of the projected-fields kSZ bispectrum as a novel probe of baryonic abundance and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology with upcoming precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-local effective field theory in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <title>Detection of the lowest mass ratio contact binary in the universe: TYC 3801-1529-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first analysis of the contact binary TYC 3801-1529-1. We observed four sets of multiple bands complete light curves and one set of radial velocity curve of the primary component. Based on a simultaneous investigation of our observed and TESS light curves and the radial velocity curve, we found that TYC 3801-1529-1 is an extremely low-mass-ratio, medium contact binary with $q=0.0356$, with the contribution of the third light at a level of about 10\%. Its mass ratio is lower than V1187 Her, making TYC 3801-1529-1 the lowest mass-ratio contact binary ever found in the universe. The light curves observed in 2022 are asymmetric, which is aptly explained by a hot spot on the primary component. A 16-year eclipse timings analysis indicates a secular increase orbital period with a rate of dp/dt$=7.96(\pm0.35)\times10^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$. We studied the stability of this target and identified that not only the value of $J_{spin}/J_{orb}$, but also the mass ratio surpass the unstable boundary. Hence, TYC 3801-1529-1 presents a challenge to theoretical research and ought to be considered a progenitor of a contact binary merger.</description>

      <title>Investigating the asymmetry of young stellar outflows: Combined MUSE-X-shooter study of the Th 28 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising stellar jet asymmetries is key to setting robust constraints on jet launching models and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind jet launching. We aim to characterise the asymmetric properties of the bipolar jet coming from the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28. We combined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and high-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line ratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios to compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within both lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the source and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using the estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities. The blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and moderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to previous studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by a factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in the line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star and compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of the jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet asymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the jet. Furthermore, the combined dataset offers access to a broad array of accretion tracers. In turn, this enables a more accurate estimation of the mass accretion rate, revealing a value of Macc that is higher by a factor &gt;350 than would otherwise be determined. Supplementary figures and tables are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi:10.5281/zenodo.13373809).</description>

      <title>The age of the Methuselah star in light of stellar evolution models with tailored abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. HD140283, or the Methuselah star, is a well-known reference object in stellar evolution. Its peculiar chemical composition, proximity and absence of reddening makes it an interesting case-study of Pop II stars. Thanks to recent observational efforts, we now have precise interferometric and spectroscopic constraints, as well as revised astrometric parallaxes from the Gaia mission. Aims. We aim at determining the age of HD140283 with these lastest constraints, as well as quantifying the impact of systematics from physical inaccuracies in the stellar evolution models. Methods. Using recent spectroscopic abundances from the literature, including 3D non-LTE values for C, O, and Fe, we compute opacity tables specific to HD140283. We then use them in grids of stellar evolution models coupled to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool to determine the age of HD140283. Results. With our tailored models we find an age of 12.3Gy. Using a solar-scaled mixture instead results in an age value of 14Gy, in tension with the age of the universe ($13.77\pm0.06$Gy). We also find that reducing the mixing length parameter from its solar calibrated value will lead to an even lower age, in agreement with other recent studies. However, we find no direct evidence to favour a lower mixing length parameter value from our modelling. Conclusions. Taking into account the specific elemental abundances is crucial for the modelling of HD140283, as it leads to significant differences in the inferred age. However, this effect is degenerate with a lowering of the mixing length parameter. In this respect, asteroseismic constraints might play a key role in accurately deriving the mass of HD140283, therefore strongly constraining its age.</description>

      <title>The Reliability of Type Ia Supernovae Delay Time Distributions Recovered from Galaxy Star Formation Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical analysis investigating the reliability of type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) delay-time distributions recovered from individual host galaxy star-formation histories. We utilize star-formation histories of mock samples of galaxies generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation at two redshifts to recover delay-time distributions. The delay-time distributions are constructed through piecewise constants as opposed to typically employed parametric forms such as power-laws or Gaussian or skew/log-normal functions. The SN~Ia delay-time distributions are recovered through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the likelihood space by comparing the expected SN Ia rate within each mock galaxy to the observed rate. We show that a reduced representative sample of \emph{non-host} galaxies is sufficient to reliably recover delay-time distributions while simultaneously reducing the computational load. We also highlight a potential systematic between recovered delay-time distributions and the mass-weighted ages of the underlying host galaxy stellar population.</description>

      <title>Wide Area VISTA Extra-galactic Survey (WAVES): Unsupervised star-galaxy separation on the WAVES-Wide photometric input catalogue using UMAP and ${\rm{\scriptsize HDBSCAN}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star-galaxy separation is a crucial step in creating target catalogues for extragalactic spectroscopic surveys. A classifier biased towards inclusivity risks including spurious stars, wasting fibre hours, while a more conservative classifier might overlook galaxies, compromising completeness and hence survey objectives. To avoid bias introduced by a training set in supervised methods, we employ an unsupervised machine learning approach. Using photometry from the Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES)-Wide catalogue comprising 9-band $u-K_s$ data, we create a feature space with colours, fluxes, and apparent size information extracted by ${\rm P{\scriptsize RO} F{\scriptsize OUND}}$. We apply the non-linear dimensionality reduction method UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) combined with the classifier ${\rm{\scriptsize HDBSCAN}}$ to classify stars and galaxies. Our method is verified against a baseline colour and morphological method using a truth catalogue from Gaia, SDSS, GAMA, and DESI. We correctly identify 99.72% of galaxies within the AB magnitude limit of $Z = 21.2$, with an F1 score of $0.9971 \pm 0.0018$ across the entire ground truth sample, compared to $0.9879 \pm 0.0088$ from the baseline method. Our method's higher purity ($0.9967 \pm 0.0021$) compared to the baseline ($0.9795 \pm 0.0172$) increases efficiency, identifying 11% fewer galaxy or ambiguous sources, saving approximately 70,000 fibre hours on the 4MOST instrument. We achieve reliable classification statistics for challenging sources including quasars, compact galaxies, and low surface brightness galaxies, retrieving 95.1%, 84.6%, and 99.5% of them respectively. Angular clustering analysis validates our classifications, showing consistency with expected galaxy clustering, regardless of the baseline classification.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the magnetic field structure throughout the Galactic Center (GC) has long been of interest. The recent Far-InfraREd Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) Survey reveals preliminary connections between the seemingly distinct vertical and horizontal magnetic field distributions previously observed in the GC. We use the statistical techniques of the Histogram of Relative Orientation (HRO) and the Projected Rayleigh Statistic (PRS) to assess whether the CMZ magnetic field preferentially aligns with the structure of the CMZ molecular clouds or the morphology of the non-thermal emission of the GC NTF population. We find that there is a range of magnetic field orientations throughout the population of CMZ molecular clouds, ranging from parallel to perpendicular orientation. We posit these orientations depend on the prevalence of gravitational shear in the GC in contrast with what is observed in Galactic Disk star-forming regions. We also compare the magnetic field orientation from dust polarimetry with individual prominent NTFs, finding a preferred perpendicular relative orientation. This perpendicular orientation indicates that the vertical field component found in the FIREPLACE observations is not spatially confined to the NTFs, providing evidence for a more pervasive vertical field in the GC. From dynamical arguments, we estimate an upper limit on the magnetic field strength for this vertical field, finding B less than or equal to 4 mG. A field close to this upper limit would indicate that the NTFs are not local enhancements of a weaker background field and that the locations of the NTFs depend on proximity to sites of cosmic ray production.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with POMPOCO: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

Abstract: Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources are compact radio galaxies (RGs), with jets extending up to 20 kpc and ages &lt;10^3 years. They are considered to evolve to Fanaroff-Riley RGs, but the real scenario to explain the compact sources remains unsolved. The young compact jets make GPS/CSS ideal for studying feedback in the nuclear region of AGNs because the jets are just starting to leave this region. Numerical simulations and jet power estimates suggest that compact sources can drive outflows on scales several times larger than the radio source itself, but the lack of suitable data limits comparisons between theory and observation. We carried out an optical spectroscopic study of 82 CSS/GPS with SDSS-DR12 data to investigate the influence of compact jets in the gas. We found outflowing gas components in the [OIII]\lambda5007 emission lines in half of our sample. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas in compact sources is comparable to that observed in extended RGs, indicating that the compact jets can drive powerful outflows similar to those in FR RGs. The observed anti-correlation between the kinetic power of the outflow and the radio luminosity suggests an interaction between the young jet and the interstellar medium (ISM). This finding provides significant observational support for previous simulations of jet-ISM interactions and supports the evolutionary scenario for RGs. However, the lack of sources with high kinetic efficiency indicates that some compact galaxies may be frustrated sources.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Looking for Signs of Discreteness in the Gravitational-wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is expected to produce a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Here we investigate how signs of the discrete nature of this GWB can manifest in pulsar timing arrays through excursions from, and breaks in, the expected $f_{\mathrm{GW}}^{-2/3}$ power-law of the GWB strain spectrum. To do this, we create a semi-analytic SMBHB population model, fit to NANOGrav's 15 yr GWB amplitude, and with 1,000 realizations we study the populations' characteristic strain and residual spectra. Comparing our models to the NANOGrav 15 yr spectrum, we find two interesting excursions from the power-law. The first, at $2 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is below our GWB realizations with $p$-value significance $p = 0.05$ to $0.06$ ($\approx 1.8 \sigma - 1.9 \sigma$). The second, at $16 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is above our GWB realizations with $p = 0.04$ to $0.15$ ($\approx 1.4 \sigma - 2.1 \sigma$). We explore the properties of a loud SMBHB which could cause such an excursion. Our simulations also show that the expected number of SMBHBs decreases by three orders of magnitude, from $\sim 10^6$ to $\sim 10^3$, between $2\; \mathrm{nHz}$ and $20 \; \mathrm{nHz}$. This causes a break in the strain spectrum as the stochasticity of the background breaks down at $26^{+28}_{-19} \; \mathrm{nHz}$, consistent with predictions pre-dating GWB measurements. The diminished GWB signal from SMBHBs at frequencies above the $26~\mathrm{nHz}$ break opens a window for PTAs to detect continuous GWs from individual SMBHBs or GWs from the early universe.</description>

      <title>Evolution of stars with 60 and 200 Msun: predictions for WNh stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the evolution of two massive stars at solar metallicity (Z=0.014) taken from Romagnolo et al. (2024, Paper I); by running evolution models for initial masses 60 and 200 Msun, using MESA and GENEC. For the mass loss, we adopt the self-consistent m-CAK prescription for the optically thin winds of OB-stars, a semi-empirical formula for H-rich thick wind of WNh stars, and a hydrodynamically consistent formula for the H-poor thick wind of classical Wolf-Rayet stars. Both codes predict different tracks across the HRD. For the 60 Msun case, Genec models predict a more efficient rotational mixing and more chemically homogeneous evolution, whereas MESA model predicts a large radial expansion post-MS reaching the LBV phase. For the 200 Msun case, differences are less relevant because their evolution is dominated by wind mass loss with a weaker dependence on internal mixing, and only the treatment for superadiabacity creates an impact during the He-burning stage. The switch of the mass loss based on the proximity to the Eddington factor instead of the removal of outer layers, implies the existence of WNh stars with a large mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface formed from initial masses $\gtrsim60$ Msun. These stars are constrained in a Teff range of the HR diagram which corresponds to the MS band, in agreement with the observations of Galactic WNh stars. While our models employ a fixed $\Gamma_e$ threshold for the switch to thick winds, rather than a continuous thin-to-thick wind model, the good reproduction of observations supports the robustness of the wind model upgrades introduced in Paper I, allowing its application to studies of late-stage stellar evolution before core collapse.</description>
