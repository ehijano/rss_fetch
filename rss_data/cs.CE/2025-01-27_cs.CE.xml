      <title>GeoSim.AI: AI assistants for numerical simulations in geomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to accomplish tasks via natural language instructions is one of the most efficient forms of interaction between humans and technology. This efficiency has been translated into practical applications with generative AI tools now allowing users to get things done through natural language queries. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift in this direction. With ongoing advancements in the field of generative AI, integrating natural language commands into sophisticated technical fields in science and engineering is becoming increasingly feasible. This paper introduces GeoSim.AI - a suite of AI assistants for numerical simulations in geomechanics - thereby demonstrating the transformative potential of generative AI in geotechnical engineering. We investigate how AI assistants powered by LLMs can streamline the process of creating complex simulation inputs and interpreting results by translating natural language instructions or image inputs into precise technical commands and scripts. This approach aims to bridge the gap between human intent and the intricate requirements of numerical modeling tools, potentially revolutionizing how researchers and engineers interact with simulation software. We present demonstrations involving AI assistants for performing slope stability analyses in various software packages. The demonstrations highlight the potential of this technology to significantly enhance productivity and accessibility in computational geomechanics. GeoSim.AI is under active development, continuously expanding the suite of AI assistants for various numerical simulation problems in geotechnical engineering.</description>

      <title>TFG-Flow: Training-free Guidance in Multimodal Generative Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for Chemical Design and Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced computational chemistry research in various tasks. However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</description>

      <title>MAD-NG, a standalone multiplatform tool for linear and non-linear optics design and optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper will provide an overview of the capabilities of the Methodical Accelerator Design Next Generation (MAD-NG) tool. MAD-NG is a standalone, all-in-one, multi-platform tool well-suited for linear and nonlinear optics design and optimization, and has already been used in large-scale studies such as HiLumi-LHC or FCC-ee. It embeds LuaJIT, an extremely fast tracing just-in-time compiler for the Lua programming language, delivering exceptional versatility and performance for the forefront of computational physics. The core of MAD-NG relies on the fast Generalized Truncated Power Series Algebra (GTPSA) library, which has been specially developed to handle many parameters and high-order differential algebra, including Lie map operators. This ecosystem offers powerful features for the analysis and optimization of linear and nonlinear optics, thanks to the fast parametric nonlinear normal forms and the polyvalent matching command. A few examples and results will complete this overview of the MAD-NG application.</description>

      <title>Input Convex Lipschitz RNN: A Fast and Robust Approach for Engineering Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational efficiency and robustness are essential in process modeling, optimization, and control for real-world engineering applications. While neural network-based approaches have gained significant attention in recent years, conventional neural networks often fail to address these two critical aspects simultaneously or even independently. Inspired by natural physical systems and established literature, input convex architectures are known to enhance computational efficiency in optimization tasks, whereas Lipschitz-constrained architectures improve robustness. However, combining these properties within a single model requires careful review, as inappropriate methods for enforcing one property can undermine the other. To overcome this, we introduce a novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks (ICLRNNs). This architecture seamlessly integrates the benefits of convexity and Lipschitz continuity, enabling fast and robust neural network-based modeling and optimization. The ICLRNN outperforms existing recurrent units in both computational efficiency and robustness. Additionally, it has been successfully applied to practical engineering scenarios, such as modeling and control of chemical process and the modeling and real-world solar irradiance prediction for solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore.
