      <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single-use detection. We demonstrate a hybridization strategy synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic-electronic conductors in high-performing stand-alone chemiresistors. Our work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. We demonstrate the effect of hybridization across well-studied cMOFs based on 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotripphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). We conduct a comprehensive mechanistic study to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. Our findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long-term response retention. This mechanism was further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate-analyte interactions. We also find that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co-processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced ClNO$_2$ formation at the interface of sea-salt aerosol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reactive uptake of $\mathrm{N_2O_5}$ on sea-spray aerosol plays a key role in regulating NO$_\mathrm{x}$ concentration in the troposphere. Despite numerous field and laboratory studies, a microscopic understanding of its heterogeneous reactivity remains unclear. Here, we use molecular simulation and theory to elucidate the chlorination of $\mathrm{N_2O_5}$ to form ClNO$_2$, the primary reactive channel within sea-spray aerosol. We find the formation of ClNO$_2$ is markedly enhanced at the air-water interface due to the stabilization of the charge-delocalized transition state, as evident from the formulation of bimolecular rate theory in heterogeneous environments. We explore the consequences of the enhanced interfacial reactivity in the uptake of $\mathrm{N_2O_5}$ using numerical solutions of molecular reaction-diffusion equations as well as their analytical approximations. Our results suggest that the current interpretation of aerosol branching ratios needs to be revisited.</description>

      <title>Alternant Hydrocarbon Diradicals as Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row transition metal complexes via optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) mechanisms analogous to the diamond-NV colour centre. However, significantly less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most luminescent open-shell organic molecules are {\pi}-diradicals, but such systems often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realise a stable molecular qubit. In this work, we propose the use of alternancy symmetry to selectively minimise radical-radical interactions in the ground state, generating {\pi}-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers, referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms. The molecular parameters are set in the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of realising a molecular colour centre with alternant {\pi}-diradicals.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Tautomeric Effects in High-Resolution Oxygen 1s X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Purines and Pyrimidines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purines and pyrimidines, crucial building blocks in biological systems, have attracted significant interest across molecular physics, biochemistry, pharmacology, and chemistry. Extensive spectroscopies have been employed for characterization, while the temperature and potential tautomeric effects can complicate the interpretation of underlying physics and chemistry. Here, we conducted first-principles simulations to analyze the vibrationally-resolved O1s X-ray photoelectron spectra of 6 common biomolecules at different temperatures, comprising 3 purine (xanthine, caffeine, and hypoxanthine) and 3 pyrimidine (thymine, 5F-uracil, and uracil) derivatives, and the tautomeric effect of hypoxanthine at varying temperatures. Using both time-independent (TI) and time-dependent (TD) methods under the Franck-Condon approximation, we obtained theoretical spectra that exhibited excellent agreement with experiments. Our analysis of these systems, all featuring carbonyl oxygens, unveiled distinctive characteristics of oxygen in N-CO-N (O2) compared to that within a N-CO-C structure (O1), showcasing higher O1s binding energy and total vibrational reorganization energy. We observed small differences in the zero-point vibration energies between the core-ionized and ground states, indicating a weak Duschinsky rotation effect. We consistently found that O1s ionization resulted in elongation of the O*=C bond length. The TI method facilitated the assignment of experimental spectra to different atoms or tautomers, where the atom-specific vibronic profiles of all 6 molecules exhibited similarity, with the 0-2 transitions dominating. TD enabled a more comprehensive exploration of the temperature effect, and the tautomeric effect of hypoxanthine by incorporating the Boltzmann population ratios of tautomers. We observed significant temperature dependence in the vibronic features present in these spectra.</description>

      <title>Stopping mass-selected alkaline-earth metal monofluoride beams of high energy via formation of unusually stable anions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct laser-coolability and a comparatively simple electronic structure render alkaline-earth metal monofluoride molecules versatile laboratories for precision tests of fundamental physics. In this theoretical work, a route for efficient stopping and cooling of high-energy hot beams of mass-selected alkaline-earth metal monofluorides via their anions is explored to facilitate subsequent precision experiments with trapped molecules. It is shown that these molecular anions possess an unusually strong chemical bond and that RaF$^-$ features properties favourable for efficient pre-cooling, indicating the applicability of direct laser-cooling of the anion.</description>

      <title>Machine learning activation function parameterization of the occupation numbers for natural orbital functionals based on electron pairing approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of natural orbital functional theory, having a convenient representation of the optimization function becomes critical for the computational performance of the calculation. Recognizing this, we propose an innovative parametrization of the occupation numbers that takes advantage of the electron-pairing approach used in Piris natural orbital functionals, through the adoption of the softmax function, a pivotal component in modern deep-learning models. Our approach not only ensures adherence to the N-representability of the first-order reduced density matrix (1RDM) but also significantly enhances the computational efficiency of 1RDM functional theory calculations. The effectiveness of this alternative parameterization approach was assessed using the W4-17-MR molecular set, which demonstrated faster and robust convergence compared to previous implementations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-based black pigments, a widely used class of pigments, are difficult to differentiate with the noninvasive techniques currently used in cultural heritage science. We utilize pump-probe microscopy to distinguish four common carbon-based black pigments as pure pigments, as two-component black pigment mixtures, and as a mixture of a black and a colorful pigment. This work also demonstrates that even nominally homogeneous pigments present remarkable, and useful, heterogeneity in pump-probe microscopy.</description>

      <title>Effects of Structural Variations to X-ray Absorption Spectra of g-C$_3$N$_4$: Insights from DFT and TDDFT Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely employed for structure characterization of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$) and its composites. Nevertheless, even for pure g-C$_3$N$_4$, discrepancies in energy and profile exist across different experiments, which can be attributed to variations in structures arising from diverse synthesis conditions and calibration procedures. Here, we conducted a theoretical investigation on XAS of three representative g-C$_3$N$_4$ structures (planar, corrugated, and micro-corrugated) optimized with different strategies, to understand the structure-spectroscopy relation. Different methods were compared, including density functional theory (DFT) with the full (FCH) or equivalent (ECH) core-hole approximation, as well as the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). FCH was responsible for getting accurate absolute absorption energy; while ECH and TDDFT aided in interpreting the spectra, through ECH-state canonical molecular orbitals (ECH-CMOs) and natural transition orbitals (NTOs), respectively. With each method, the spectra at the three structures show evident differences, which can be correlated to different individual experiments or in between. Our calculations explained the structural reason behind the spectral discrepancies among different experiments. Moreover, profiles predicted by these methods also displayed consistency, so their differences can be used as a reliable indicator of their accuracy. Both ECH-CMOs and NTO particle orbitals led to similar graphics, validating their applicability in interpreting the transitions. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure-XAS relation for g-C$_3$N$_4$, provides concrete explanations for the spectral differences reported in various experiments, and offers insight for future structure dynamical and transient X-ray spectral analyses.</description>

      <title>Broadband NIR photon upconversion generates NIR persistent luminescence for bioimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upconversion persistent luminescence (UCPL) phosphors that can be directly charged by near-infrared (NIR) light have gained considerable attention due to their promising applications ranging from photonics to biomedicine. However, current lanthanide-based UCPL phosphors show small absorption cross-sections and low upconversion charging efficiency. The development of UCPL phosphors faces challenges of lacking flexible upconversion charging pathways and poor design flexibility. Herein, we discovered a new lattice defect-mediated broadband photon upconversion process and the accompanied NIR-to-NIR UCPL in Cr-doped zinc gallate nanoparticles. The zinc gallate nanoparticles can be directly activated by broadband NIR light in the 700-1000 nm range to produce persistent luminescence at about 700 nm, which is also readily enhanced by rationally tailoring the lattice defects in the phosphors. This proposed UCPL phosphors achieved a signal-to-background ratio of over 200 in bioimaging by efficiently avoiding interference from autofluorescence and light scattering. Our findings reported the lattice defect-mediated photon upconversion for the first time, which significantly expanded the horizons for the flexible design of NIR-to-NIR UCPL phosphors toward broad applications.</description>

      <title>Selective Excitation of Vibrations in a Single Molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability to excite, probe, and manipulate vibrational modes is essential for understanding and controlling chemical reactions at the molecular level. Recent advancements in tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopies have enabled the probing of vibrational fingerprints in a single molecule with Angstrom-scale spatial resolution. However, achieving controllable excitation of specific vibrational modes in individual molecules remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the selective excitation and probing of vibrational modes in single deprotonated phthalocyanine molecules utilizing resonance Raman spectroscopy in a scanning tunneling microscope. Selective excitation is achieved by finely tuning the excitation wavelength of the laser to be resonant with the vibronic transitions between the molecular ground electronic state and the vibrational levels in the excited electronic state, resulting in the state-selective enhancement of the resonance Raman signal. Our approach sets the stage for steering chemical transformations in molecules on surfaces by selective excitation of molecular vibrations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel reference state for density functional theory, termed the hydrogenic ansatz, is introduced in this work. This ansatz allows for the exact representation of electron density in terms of atom-localized, non-interacting, perturbed hydrogenic orbitals. Self-consistent equations for localized atomic states are derived. Total energy functional is found to closely resemble tight binding theory. The hydrogenic ansatz facilitates partial cancellation of inter-atomic electron-electron and electron-nuclear interactions, which allows for the derivation of analytical Hamiltonian matrix elements in a weak interaction limit. The non-empirical formalism provides charge and energy decomposition analyses at no additional cost. It also includes mechanisms to remove self-interaction and static correlation errors. The numerical accuracy and transferability of the derived equations for model systems have been previously demonstrated [Mironenko, J. Phys. Chem. A 127, 7836 (2023)].</description>

Abstract: Finding collective variables to describe some important coarse-grained information on physical systems, in particular metastable states, remains a key issue in molecular dynamics. Recently, machine learning techniques have been intensively used to complement and possibly bypass expert knowledge in order to construct collective variables. Our focus here is on neural network approaches based on autoencoders. We study some relevant mathematical properties of the loss function considered for training autoencoders, and provide physical interpretations based on conditional variances and minimum energy paths. We also consider various extensions in order to better describe physical systems, by incorporating more information on transition states at saddle points, and/or allowing for multiple decoders in order to describe several transition paths. Our results are illustrated on toy two dimensional systems and on alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly energetic photons of ultraviolet light drive electronic and rovibronic transitions in all molecular species. This radiation is thus a prime tool for strongly selective spectroscopic fingerprinting and real-time environmental monitoring if broad spectral coverage, short acquisition times and high spectral resolution is achieved - requirements that are in mutual competition in traditional applications. As a novel approach with intrinsic potency in all three aspects, here we introduce ultraviolet dual comb spectroscopy using two broadband ultraviolet frequency combs centered at 871 THz and covering a spectral bandwidth of 35.7 THz. Within a 100 us acquisition time window, we obtain rotational state-resolved absorption spectra of formaldehyde, a prototype molecule with high relevance for laser spectroscopy and environmental sciences. This is the first realization of broadband dual comb spectroscopy in the ultraviolet spectral region and a pioneering tool to allow for real-time monitoring of rovibronic transitions.</description>

Abstract: The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) scheme is one of the popular fragmentation-based methods and has the potential advantage of making the circuit flat in quantum chemical calculations on quantum computers. In this study, we used a GPU-accelerated quantum simulator (cuQuantum) to perform the electron correlation part of the FMO calculation as unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for hydrogen-bonded (FH)$_3$ and (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O systems with the STO-3G basis set. VQE-UCCD calculations were performed using both canonical and localized MO sets, and the results were examined from the point of view of size-consistency and orbital-invariance affected by the Trotter error. It was found that the use of localized MO leads to better results, especially for (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O. The GPU acceleration was substantial for the simulations with larger numbers of qubits, and was about a factor of 6.7--7.7 for 18 qubit systems.</description>
