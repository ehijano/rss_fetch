      <title>Notes on symplectic squeezing in $T^* \mathbb T^n$ and spectra of Finsler dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, on the one hand, we prove that for $n \geq 2$ any subbundle of $T^* \mathbb T^n$ with bounded fibers symplectically embeds into a trivial subbundle of $T^* \mathbb T^n$ where the fiber is an irrational cylinder. This not only resolves an open problem in Gong-Xue's recent work (which was stated for the 4-dimension case, that is, $n =2$) and also generalizes to any higher-dimensional situation. The proof is based on some version of Dirichlet's approximation theorem. On the other hand, we generalize a main result in Gong-Xue's work mentioned above, showing that any topologically trivial Liouville diffeomorphism on $T^*M$ (for instance, a diffeomorphism induced by an isometry on $M$) does not change the full marked length spectrum of a Finsler metric $F$ on $M$, up to a lifting of the Finsler metric $F$ to the unit codisk bundle $D^*_FM$. The proof is based on persistence module theory.</description>

      <title>Revisit Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds of dimension 6 with 4 fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the circle acts in a Hamiltonian way on a compact symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$, then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. The case that there are exactly $n+1$ isolated fixed points has its importance due to various reasons. Besides dimension 2 with 2 fixed points, and dimension 4 with 3 fixed points, which are known, the next interesting case is dimension 6 with 4 fixed points, for which the integral cohomology ring and the total Chern class of the manifold, and the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points are classified by Tolman. In this note, we use a new different argument to prove Tolman's results for the dimension 6 with 4 fixed points case. We observe that the integral cohomology ring of the manifold has a nice basis in terms of the moment map values of the fixed points, and the largest weight between two fixed points is nicely related to the first Chern class of the manifold. We will use these ingredients to determine the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points, and moreover to determine the global invariants the integral cohomology ring and total Chern class of the manifold. The idea allows a direct approach of the problem, and the argument is short and easy to follow.</description>
