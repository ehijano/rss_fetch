      <title>The Kolmogorov Complexity of Irish traditional dance music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the Kolmogorov complexity of melodies in Irish traditional dance music using Lempel-Ziv compression. The "tunes" of the music are presented in so-called "ABC notation" as simply a sequence of letters from an alphabet: We have no rhythmic variation, with all notes being of equal length. Our estimation of algorithmic complexity can be used to distinguish "simple" or "easy" tunes (with more repetition) from "difficult" ones (with less repetition) which should prove useful for students learning tunes. We further present a comparison of two tune categories (reels and jigs) in terms of their complexity.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Fano and Non-Fano Index Coding Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matroid theory is fundamentally connected with index coding and network coding problems. In fact, the reliance of linear index coding and network coding rates on the characteristic of a field has been demonstrated by using the two well-known matroid instances, namely the Fano and non-Fano matroids. This established the insufficiency of linear coding, one of the fundamental theorems in both index coding and network coding. While the Fano matroid is linearly representable only over fields with characteristic two, the non-Fano instance is linearly representable only over fields with odd characteristic. For fields with arbitrary characteristic $p$, the Fano and non-Fano matroids were extended to new classes of matroid instances whose linear representations are dependent on fields with characteristic $p$. However, these matroids have not been well appreciated nor cited in the fields of network coding and index coding. In this paper, we first reintroduce these matroids in a more structured way. Then, we provide a completely independent alternative proof with the main advantage of using only matrix manipulation rather than complex concepts in number theory and matroid theory. In this new proof, it is shown that while the class $p$-Fano matroid instances are linearly representable only over fields with characteristic $p$, the class $p$-non-Fano instances are representable over fields with any characteristic other than characteristic $p$. Finally, following the properties of the class $p$-Fano and $p$-non-Fano matroid instances, we characterize two new classes of index coding instances, respectively, referred to as the class $p$-Fano and $p$-non-Fano index coding, each with a size of $p^2 + 4p + 3$.</description>

      <title>Delay Tradeoff and Adaptive Finite Blocklength Framework for URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With various time-sensitive tasks to be served, ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) has become one of the most important scenarios for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications. The end-to-end delay from the sub-millisecond-level to the second-level is first put forward for a wide range of delay-sensitive tasks in the future sixth generation (6G) communication networks, which imposes a strict requirement on satisfying various real-time services and applications with different stringent quality of service (QoS) demands. Thus, we need to find out new delay reduction framework to satisfy the more stringent delay requirements. In this article, a state-of-the-art overview of end-to-end delay composition and delay analysis combined with access protocols are elaborated. We reveal the tradeoff relationship among transmission delay, queuing delay, and retransmission times with the change of blocklength in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Based on the tradeoff and combining the grant-free (GF) random access (RA) scheme, we propose the adaptive blocklength framework and investigate several effective algorithms for efficiently reducing the over-the-air delay. Numerical results show that our proposed framework and schemes can significantly reduce the over-the-air delay for URLLC.</description>

      <title>Dumb RIS-Assisted Random Beamforming for Energy Efficiency Enhancement of Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficiency (EE) is one of the most important metrics for the beyond fifth generation (B5G) and the future sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been widely focused on EE enhancement for wireless networks because it is power-saving, programmable, and easy to be deployed. However, RIS is generally passive and thus difficult to obtain corresponding full channel state information (CSI), which severely impacts the EE enhancement of RIS-assisted wireless communications. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose the new single-active-antenna combined RIS transmitter structure, which can replace traditional multiple antennas to reduce hardware cost and power consumption. Based on the single-active-antenna combined RIS structure, we develop the Dumb RIS-Assisted Random Beamforming (Darb)-based Joint RIS-Elements and Transmit-power optimizAtion (Jeta) scheme, where dumb RIS randomly changes its phase shift according to isotropic distribution only depending on the CSI feedback from users to RIS-assisted transmitter. Then, we jointly design the number of RIS elements and optimize the transmit power to maximize the EE of RIS-assisted wireless communications. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional multi-antenna system, our developed Darb-based-Jeta scheme can significantly increase the EE without the full CSI.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Secure MC-NOMA Empowered ISAC Systems with an Active Eve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the integrated sensing and communication(ISAC) technology emerges as a promising component of sixth generation (6G), the study of its physical layer security has become a key concern for researchers. Specifically, in this work, we focus on the security issues over a multi-carrier (MC)-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted ISAC system, considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) of an active Eve and graded confidentiality demands for users. To this end, the subcarrier allocation, the information, and artificial noise beamforming are designed to maximize the minimum communication rate, while ensuring diverse confidentiality and sensing performance demands. An effective security strategy is devised via the Lagrangian dual transformation and successive convex approximation methods. Simulations confirm the validity and robustness of the proposed scheme in terms of the security performance.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Blocklength Minimization of Uplink RSMA for Short Packet Transmissions in URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is one of the most promising techniques for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) with stringent requirements on delay and reliability of multiple access. To fully explore the delay performance enhancement brought by uplink RSMA to URLLC, in this paper, we evaluate the performance of two-user uplink RSMA and propose the corresponding blocklength minimization problem. We analyze the impact of finite blocklength (FBL) code on the achievable rate region and the effective throughput of uplink RSMA. On this basis, we propose the problem of minimizing the blocklength for uplink RSMA with power allocation under constrained reliability and effective throughput. Then, we present an alternating optimization method to solve this non-convex problem. Simulation results show that different from the infinite blocklength (IBL) regime, the achievable rate region of the uplink RSMA is not always larger than that of uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in the FBL regime. But with the help of our proposed blocklength minimization scheme, uplink RSMA can achieve the same achievable rate with a smaller blocklength compared to uplink NOMA, frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA) without the need for time sharing in the FBL regime, showing the potential of uplink RSMA to achieve low delay for URLLC.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-Far Field Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic MIMO communications, enabled by large-scale antenna arrays with quasi-continuous apertures, is a potential technology for spectrum efficiency improvement. However, the increased antenna aperture size extends the range of the Fresnel region, leading to a hybrid near-far field communication mode. The users and scatterers randomly lie in near-field and far-field zones, and thus, conventional far-field-only and near-field-only channel estimation methods may not work. To tackle this challenge, we demonstrate the existence of the power diffusion (PD) effect, which leads to a mismatch between the hybrid-field channel and existing channel estimation methods. Specifically, in far-field and near-field transform domains, the power gain of one channel path may diffuse to other positions, thus generating fake paths. This renders the conventional techniques unable to detect those real paths. We propose a PD-aware orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to eliminate the influence of the PD effect by identifying the PD range within which paths diffuse to other positions. PD-OMP fits a general case without prior knowledge of near-field and far-field path numbers and the user's location. The computational complexity of PD-OMP and the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for the sparse-signal-recovery-based channel estimation are also derived. Simulation results show that PD-OMP outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid-field channel estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Phase-Shift and Transmit Power Optimization for RIS-Aided Massive MIMO SWIPT IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where energy-limited IoT devices are overlaid with cellular information users (IUs). IoT devices are wirelessly powered by a RIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station (BS), which is simultaneously serving a group of IUs. By leveraging a two-timescale transmission scheme, precoding at the BS is developed based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while the passive beamforming at the RIS is adapted to the slowly-changing statistical CSI. We derive closed-form expressions for the achievable spectral efficiency of the IUs and average harvested energy at the IoT devices, taking the channel estimation errors and pilot contamination into account. Then, a non-convex max-min fairness optimization problem is formulated subject to the power budget at the BS and individual quality of service requirements of IUs, where the transmit power levels at the BS and passive RIS reflection coefficients are jointly optimized. Our simulation results show that the average harvested energy at the IoT devices can be improved by $132\%$ with the proposed resource allocation algorithm. Interestingly, IoT devices benefit from the pilot contamination, leading to a potential doubling of the harvested energy in certain network configurations.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO Surveillance of Multiple Untrusted Communication Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system is considered for enhancing the monitoring performance of wireless surveillance, where a large number of distributed multi-antenna aided legitimate monitoring nodes (MNs) proactively monitor multiple distributed untrusted communication links. We consider two types of MNs whose task is to either observe the untrusted transmitters or jam the untrusted receivers. We first analyze the performance of CF-mMIMO surveillance relying on both maximum ratio (MR) and partial zero-forcing (PZF) combining schemes and derive closed-form expressions for the monitoring success probability (MSP) of the MNs. We then propose a joint optimization technique that designs the MN mode assignment, power control, and MN-weighting coefficient control to enhance the MSP based on the long-term statistical channel state information knowledge. This challenging problem is effectively transformed into tractable forms and efficient algorithms are proposed for solving them. Numerical results show that our proposed CF-mMIMO surveillance system considerably improves the monitoring performance with respect to a full-duplex co-located massive MIMO proactive monitoring system. More particularly, when the untrusted pairs are distributed over a wide area and use the MR combining, the proposed solution provides nearly a thirty-fold improvement in the minimum MSP over the co-located massive MIMO baseline, and forty-fold improvement, when the PZF combining is employed.</description>

      <title>Exact Graph Matching in Correlated Gaussian-Attributed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph matching problem aims to identify node correspondence between two or more correlated graphs. Previous studies have primarily focused on models where only edge information is provided. However, in many social networks, not only the relationships between users, represented by edges, but also their personal information, represented by features, are present. In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying node correspondence in correlated graphs, where additional node features exist, as in many real-world settings. We propose a two-step procedure, where we initially match a subset of nodes only using edge information, and then match the remaining nodes using node features. We derive information-theoretic limits for exact graph matching on this model. Our approach provides a comprehensive solution to the real-world graph matching problem by providing systematic ways to utilize both edge and node information for exact matching of the graphs.</description>

      <title>Blind Beamforming for Coverage Enhancement with Intelligent Reflecting Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional policy for configuring an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) typically requires channel state information (CSI), thus incurring substantial overhead costs and facing incompatibility with the current network protocols. This paper proposes a blind beamforming strategy in the absence of CSI, aiming to boost the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all the receiver positions, namely the coverage enhancement. Although some existing works already consider the IRS-assisted coverage enhancement without CSI, they assume certain position-channel models through which the channels can be recovered from the geographic locations. In contrast, our approach solely relies on the received signal power data, not assuming any position-channel model. We examine the achievability and converse of the proposed blind beamforming method. If the IRS has $N$ reflective elements and there are $U$ receiver positions, then our method guarantees the minimum SNR of $\Omega(N^2/U)$ -- which is fairly close to the upper bound $O(N+N^2\sqrt{\ln (NU)}/\sqrt[4]{U})$. Aside from the simulation results, we justify the practical use of blind beamforming in a field test at 2.6 GHz. According to the real-world experiment, the proposed blind beamforming method boosts the minimum SNR across seven random positions in a conference room by 18.22 dB, while the position-based method yields a boost of 12.08 dB.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Finite Blocklength for Low Access Delay in 6G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of real-time applications with ultra-low delay requirements quickly grows, massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (mURLLC) has been proposed to provide a wide range of delay-sensitive services for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. However, it is difficult to meet the stringent delay demand of massive connectivity with existing grant-based (GB) random access and fixed frame structure in long-term evolution (LTE) and the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) systems. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose the new grant-free (GF) based adaptive blocklength scheme for short packet transmission to reduce the access delay. We develop the adaptive blocklength framework where the blocklength can be adaptively changed according to the real-time load, to revise the traditional non-flexible frame structure which impacts the delay performance. Taking the features of mURLLC into consideration, we analyze the GF random access procedure, packet arrival behavior, packet collision, and packet transmission error in the finite blocklength (FB) regime. On this basis, we derive the closed-form expression of successful access and transmission probability and give the GF-based status update model. Then, we propose the access delay minimization problem that jointly considers queuing delay and transmission delay to reduce the overall access delay. With the alternating optimization algorithm, we obtain the optimal blocklength of each packet, thus forming the corresponding adaptive blocklength scheme for mURLLC. Simulation results verify the correctness of theoretical results and show that our proposed adaptive blocklength scheme can significantly reduce the access delay compared with that of LTE and 5G NR systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple Access Integrated Adaptive Finite Blocklength for Ultra-Low Delay in 6G Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facing the dramatic increase of real-time applications and time-sensitive services, large-scale ultra-low delay requirements are put forward for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. To support massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC), in this paper we propose an adaptive finite blocklength framework to reduce the over-the-air delay for short packet transmissions with multiple-access and delay-bounded demands. In particular, we first give the specified over-the-air delay model. Then, we reveal the tradeoff relationship among queuing delay, transmission delay, and the number of retransmissions along with the change of finite blocklength, as well as formulate the adaptive blocklength framework. Based on the adaptive blocklength framework and associated with grant-free (GF) access protocol, we formulate the average over-the-air delay minimization problem, where the blocklength can be adaptively changed in terms of transmission time interval (TTI) design and bandwidth allocation to achieve the optimal tradeoff and obtain its minimum over-the-air delay. We develop the cooperative multi-agent deep Q-network (M-DQN) scheme with a grouping mechanism to efficiently solve the average over-the-air delay minimization problem. Numerical results validate our proposed adaptive blocklength scheme outperforms corresponding schemes in long-term evolution (LTE) and the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR).</description>

      <title>Reliability Function of Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliability function, defined as the optimal error exponent describing the exponential decay of decoding error probability when the communicating rate is below the capacity of the channel, is one of the fundamental problems in information theory. In this work, we determine the reliability function for a general cq channel. The main contribution is a lower bound for the error exponent which is characterised by the Renyi divergence in Petz's form. It turns out that the lower bound matches the upper bound given by Dalai (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 46, 2256 (2000)) when the rate is not very low. Thus the reliability function is obtained by combining these two bounds in a proper range of communicating rate. The approach to derive the lower bound makes use of tricks on types and an observation by Renes (arXiv: 2207.08899) that channel code can be constructed from data compression scheme for uniform distribution relative to side information, whose solution to the error exponent problem is in turn determined by its dual problem -- privacy amplification, for which the exact error exponent is known.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware UAV-Enabled Target Tracking: Online Optimization with Location Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory design, the total propulsion energy consumption and initial-final location constraints are practical factors to consider. However, unlike traditional offline designs, these two constraints are non-trivial to concurrently satisfy in online UAV trajectory designs for real-time target tracking, due to the undetermined information. To address this issue, we propose a novel online UAV trajectory optimization approach for the weighted sum-predicted posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) minimization, which guarantees the feasibility of satisfying the two mentioned constraints. Specifically, our approach designs the UAV trajectory by solving two subproblems: the candidate trajectory optimization problem and the energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem. Then, an efficient solution to the candidate trajectory optimization problem is proposed based on Dinkelbach's transform and the Lasserre hierarchy, which achieves the global optimal solution under a given sufficient condition. The energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem is solved by the successive convex approximation method. Numerical results show that our proposed UAV trajectory optimization approach significantly outperforms the benchmark regarding sensing performance and energy utilization flexibility.</description>

      <title>The revised boomerang connectivity tables and their connection to the Difference Distribution Table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that functions over finite fields play a crucial role in designing substitution boxes (S-boxes) in modern block ciphers. In order to analyze the security of an S-box, recently, three new tables have been introduced: the Extended Boomerang Connectivity Table (EBCT), the Lower Boomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT), and the Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table (UBCT). In fact, these tables offer improved methods over the usual Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT) for analyzing the security of S-boxes against boomerang-style attacks. Here, we put in context these new EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT concepts by connecting them to the DDT for a differentially $\delta$-uniform function and also determine the EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT entries of three classes of differentially $4$-uniform power permutations, namely, Gold, Kasami and Bracken-Leander. We also determine the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table (DBCT) entries of the Gold function. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain some previously published results quite easily.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits. The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient must be classically simulable.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Aided MISO SWIPT-NOMA System with Energy Buffer: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and energy buffer aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, which consists of a STAR-RIS, an access point (AP), and reflection users and transmission users with energy buffers. In the proposed system, the multi-antenna AP can transmit information and energy to several single-antenna reflection and transmission users simultaneously by the NOMA fashion in the downlink, where the power transfer and information transmission states of the users are modeled using Markov chains. The reflection and transmission users harvest and store the energy in energy buffers as additional power supplies, which are partially utilized for uplink information transmission. The power outage probability, information outage probability, sum throughput, and joint outage probability closed-form expressions of the proposed system are derived over Nakagami-m fading channels, which are validated via simulations. Results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves better performance as compared to the proposed system with discrete phase shifts, the STAR-RIS aided MISO SWIPT-NOMA buffer-less, conventional RIS and energy buffer aided MISO SWIPT-NOMA, and STAR-RIS and energy buffer aided MISO SWIPT-time-division multiple access (TDMA) systems. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization-based power allocation (PSO-PA) algorithm is designed to maximize the uplink sum throughput with a constraint on the uplink joint outage probability and Jain's fairness index (JFI). Simulation results illustrate that the proposed PSO-PA algorithm can achieve an improved sum throughput performance of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>When can an expander code correct $\Omega(n)$ errors in $O(n)$ time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tanner codes are graph-based linear codes whose parity-check matrices can be characterized by a bipartite graph $G$ together with a linear inner code $C_0$. Expander codes are Tanner codes whose defining bipartite graph $G$ has good expansion property. This paper is motivated by the following natural and fundamental problem in decoding expander codes:
  What are the sufficient and necessary conditions that $\delta$ and $d_0$ must satisfy, so that \textit{every} bipartite expander $G$ with vertex expansion ratio $\delta$ and \textit{every} linear inner code $C_0$ with minimum distance $d_0$ together define an expander code that corrects $\Omega(n)$ errors in $O(n)$ time?
  For $C_0$ being the parity-check code, the landmark work of Sipser and Spielman (IEEE-TIT'96) showed that $\delta&gt;3/4$ is sufficient; later Viderman (ACM-TOCT'13) improved this to $\delta&gt;2/3-\Omega(1)$ and he also showed that $\delta&gt;1/2$ is necessary. For general linear code $C_0$, the previously best-known result of Dowling and Gao (IEEE-TIT'18) showed that $d_0=\Omega(c\delta^{-2})$ is sufficient, where $c$ is the left-degree of $G$.
  In this paper, we give a near-optimal solution to the above question for general $C_0$ by showing that $\delta d_0&gt;3$ is sufficient and $\delta d_0&gt;1$ is necessary, thereby also significantly improving Dowling-Gao's result. We present two novel algorithms for decoding expander codes, where the first algorithm is deterministic, and the second one is randomized and has a larger decoding radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07119v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The improvements on quantum technology are threatening our daily cybersecurity, as a capable quantum computer can break all currently employed asymmetric cryptosystems. In preparation for the quantum-era the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated in 2016 a standardization process for public-key encryption (PKE) schemes, key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEM) and digital signature schemes. In 2023, NIST made an additional call for post-quantum signatures. With this chapter we aim at providing a survey on code-based cryptography, focusing on PKEs and signature schemes. We cover the main frameworks introduced in code-based cryptography and analyze their security assumptions. We provide the mathematical background in a lecture notes style, with the intention of reaching a wider audience.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Joint Source Channel Coding For High Realism Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for wireless image transmission. Nevertheless, most existing work adopts an autoencoder framework to optimize conventional criteria such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) which do not suffice to maintain the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Such an issue is more prominent under stringent bandwidth constraints or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages the prior knowledge of the pre-trained Statble Diffusion model to produce high-realism images via the conditional diffusion denoising process. Our DiffJSCC first extracts multimodal spatial and textual features from the noisy channel symbols in the generation phase. Then, it produces an initial reconstructed image as an intermediate representation to aid robust feature extraction and a stable training process. In the following diffusion step, DiffJSCC uses the derived multimodal features, together with channel state information such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as conditions to guide the denoising diffusion process, which converts the initial random noise to the final reconstruction. DiffJSCC employs a novel control module to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model and adjust it to the multimodal conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets reveal that our method significantly surpasses prior deep JSCC approaches on both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance, showcasing its ability to preserve the semantics of the original transmitted images. Notably, DiffJSCC can achieve highly realistic reconstructions for 768x512 pixel Kodak images with only 3072 symbols (&lt;0.008 symbols per pixel) under 1dB SNR channels.</description>

      <title>A Modular Pragmatic Architecture for Multiuser MIMO with Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a power- and hardware-efficient, pragmatic, modular, multiuser/multibeam array-fed RIS architecture particularly suited to operate in very high frequency bands (high mmWave and sub-THz), where channels are typically sparse in the beamspace and line-of-sight (LOS) is required to achieve an acceptable received signal level. The key module is an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) with a small number of active antennas placed in the near field of a RIS with a much larger number of passive controllable reflecting elements. We propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a steerable beam with high gain and very low sidelobes. Then, $K$ independently controlled beams can be achieved by stacking $K$ of such AMAF-RIS modules. Our analysis takes in full account: 1) the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the modules, 2) the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) due to the sidelobes; 3) a thorough energy efficiency comparison with respect to conventional {\em active arrays} with the same beamforming performance. Overall, we show that the proposed architecture is very attractive in terms of spectral efficiency, ease of implementation (hardware complexity), and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>One-Bit MIMO Detection: From Global Maximum-Likelihood Detector to Amplitude Retrieval Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As communication systems advance towards the future 6G era, the incorporation of large-scale antenna arrays in base stations (BSs) presents challenges such as increased hardware costs and energy consumption. To address these issues, the use of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) has gained significant attentions. This paper focuses on one-bit multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection in an uplink multiuser transmission scenario where the BS employs one-bit ADCs. One-bit quantization retains only the sign information and loses the amplitude information, which poses a unique challenge in the corresponding detection problem. The maximum-likelihood (ML) formulation of one-bit MIMO detection has a challenging likelihood function that hinders the application of many high-performance detectors developed for classic MIMO detection (under high-resolution ADCs). While many approximate methods for the ML detection problem have been studied, it lacks an efficient global algorithm. This paper fills this gap by proposing an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm, which is guaranteed to find the global solution of the one-bit ML MIMO detection problem. Additionally, a new amplitude retrieval (AR) detection approach is developed, incorporating explicit amplitude variables into the problem formulation. The AR approach yields simpler objective functions that enable the development of efficient algorithms offering both global and approximate solutions. The paper also contributes to the computational complexity analysis of both ML and AR detection problems. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed formulations and algorithms.</description>
