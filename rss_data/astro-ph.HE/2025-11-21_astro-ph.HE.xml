      <title>Iron Nuclei in Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays Near the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of cosmic iron nuclei with energies above 10^19 eV from their sources to the Galaxy is discussed by assuming that cosmic rays at ultra-high energies are of extragalactic origin. In extragalactic space, cosmic nuclei interact with background emissions and inevitably fragment. An analysis is performed of the fraction of iron nuclei reaching the Earth and how its energy depends on the distance from cosmic ray sources. It is found that energies of iron nuclei can be used to determine restriction on the distances from their sources</description>

      <title>How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess? A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.</description>

      <title>SN 2019vxm: A Shocking Coincidence between Fermi and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock breakout and, in some cases, jet-driven high-energy emission are increasingly recognized as key signatures of the earliest phases of core-collapse supernovae, especially in Type IIn systems due to their dense, interaction-dominated circumstellar environments. We present a comprehensive photometric analysis of SN 2019vxm, a long-duration, luminous Type IIn supernova, $M_V^{}=-21.41\pm0.05\;{\rm mag}$, observed from X-ray to near-infrared. SN 2019vxm is the first superluminous supernovae Type IIn to be caught with well-sampled TESS photometric data on the rise and has a convincing coincident X-ray source at the time of first light. The high-cadence TESS light curve captures the early-time rise, which is well described by a broken power law with an index of $n=1.41\pm0.04$, significantly shallower than the canonical $n=2$ behavior. From this, we constrain the time of first light to within 7.2 hours. We identify a spatial and temporal coincidence between SN 2019vxm and the X-ray transient GRB191117A, corresponding to a $3.3\sigma$ association confidence. Both the short-duration X-ray event and the lightcurve modeling are consistent with shock breakout into a dense, asymmetric circumstellar medium, indicative of a massive, compact progenitor such as a luminous blue variable transitioning to Wolf-Rayet phase embedded in a clumpy, asymmetric environment.</description>

      <title>A pilot VLBI study of the SQUAB quasar sample featuring multiple Gaia detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our previous work identified a class of SDSS quasars exhibiting multiple Gaia detections, classifying them as candidates for various astrophysical systems such as quasar-star pairs, dual quasars, and gravitationally lensed quasars. In this paper, we present a pilot VLBI study targeting a radio-bright subsample and report the first high-resolution imaging results. By leveraging the milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI and its precise astrometric coordination incorporating with Gaia, we aim to refine the classification of these multiple matched sources, search for potential dual AGNs, and assess the efficacy of the combined Gaia-VLBI approach in resolving ambiguous quasar systems. We cross-matched the SQUAB quasar sample with the FIRST and NVSS catalogs, identifying 18 radio-emitting sources. The three brightest were selected for dual-frequency (1.6 and 4.9 GHz) VLBA observations. We performed VLBI imaging at both Gaia positions, constructed spectral index maps, and estimated brightness temperatures to characterize the radio morphology and physical properties. For the three target sources, our VLBI observations reveal compact radio structures consistent with single AGN at the primary Gaia positions. No significant emission is detected at the secondary Gaia locations. These results support the interpretation of the sources as quasar$-$star pairs, in line with earlier studies. This pilot study demonstrates the value of radio-VLBI high-resolution follow-ups on Gaia-selected quasar systems with multiple counterparts, showing how they can unambiguously reveal the true nature of these systems and help remove contaminants from dual AGN candidate samples.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Corona Geometry of Cyg X-1 with Broad Band Spectrum and Polarimetric Analysis Based on Observations in May 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) exhibited a low hard state in 2022, observed by several missions. The IXPE reported that the polarization angle is aligned with the radio jet and gave a polarization degree approximately 4 times higher than the general expectations of $1\%$ through the analysis of the time-integrated data with a simple spectral model, indicating that the disk inclination is higher than a canonical value of about $30^{\circ}$. Many subsequent theoretical studies employed a non-standard model to explain this high PD. Here, we revisit the disk/corona spectrum through a detailed joint analysis using IXPE, NuSTAR, and NICER data. By investigating the time variability of the spectrum, we find that the two-Comptonization components model can better reproduce the data than the one-Comptonization component model originally adopted. We observed a lower disk photon temperature of about 0.15 keV. Detailed simulation suggests that lowering the disk temperature by a factor of 2 increases the PD by roughly 2 percentage points in the IXPE 2--8 keV band for a slab-like corona geometry, helping to reconcile the observed high PD with theoretical predictions. However, The simulated PDs are still significantly lower than the observed ones - even for a rather high $60^{\circ}$ inclination. We also investigated the polarization properties of a simple wedge-shaped corona with a truncated disk and a sandwiching slab corona. We find that the slab corona predicts an apparent energy dependence in PD while PA remains constant in the IXPE band, in agreement with the observed polarization. Therefore, we suggest that Cyg X-1 in 2022 May exhibits a two-Comptonization coronal emission with different optical depths, and the hard one is in a sandwiching slab geometry. We also discuss how the polarization is affected by other parameters of the black hole and the corona.</description>

      <title>Thermal equilibrium curves of accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogous to the HR diagram for stars, the thermal equilibrium curve encodes the thermodynamics of accretion disks by expressing the local balance between heating -- primarily via viscous dissipation -- and cooling -- typically through radiative transfer. These curves are commonly plotted as surface density versus effective temperature. When an S-shaped locus appears, local annuli become bistable, and limit-cycle oscillations arise when the external mass-transfer rate falls within an unstable band. This behavior underpins the disk instability model for recurring outbursts in cataclysmic variables. This paper reviews first-principles thermal equilibrium curves for accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), with emphasis on dwarf novae. Unlike the parameterized $\alpha$-viscosity approach, the curves are obtained by solving the governing equations with radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, thereby reproducing S-shaped loci without prescribing $\alpha$. The disk instability in dwarf-nova systems and the physical origin of angular-momentum transport (shear stresses) are also briefly reviewed. Notes on the stability of radiation-dominated accretion flows are included in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Aql X-1 from dawn 'til dusk: the early rise, fast state transition and decay of its 2024 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are usually first detected by all-sky X-ray monitors when they enter new outbursts, typically at X-ray luminosities above $\sim$10$^{36}$ erg/s. Observations of these sources during the early rise of the outbursts have so far been very limited. However, the launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly improved our ability to detect fainter X-ray activity, unlocking access to the outburst early rise. In September 2024, EP detected the early onset of a new outburst from the neutron star LMXB Aql X-1, catching the source at a luminosity below 10$^{35}$ erg/s. In this paper we present results from a comprehensive, multi-wavelength campaign of this event, combining data from EP, NICER, NuSTAR, Swift and Las Cumbres Observatory covering the full outburst from its early rise through its decay. By comparing X-ray and optical light curves obtained with Las Cumbres Observatory during the initial rise, we show that the start of the X-ray emission lagged the optical rise by, at most, 3 days. Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy revealed how the geometry and the physical properties of the accretion flow evolve during this early stage of the outburst, as well as at higher luminosities as the source transitioned through the canonical X-ray spectral states - hard, intermediate and soft. These data show that the source underwent a very rapid, about 12-h long, transition from the hard to the soft state about two weeks after the optical onset of the outburst. The evolution of the temperature and physical sizes of both the inner region of the disk and a black body near the NS surface suggest that at the state transition, a boundary and spreading layer likely formed. We discuss these results in the context of time-scales for outburst evolution and state transitions in accreting neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>Tracing Early Cosmic Chemical Enrichment: A Uniform XMM-Newton Survey of Metallicity in Galaxy Groups and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed metal abundances in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy groups and clusters, $Z_{ICM}$, exceed what is expected from present-day stellar populations alone. Galaxy clusters are presumed to be near closed-box systems, allowing constraints to be placed on the origins of metals and stellar populations responsible for $Z_{ICM}$. We present a uniform XMM-Newton survey of 26 galaxy groups and clusters, measuring radial metallicity profiles and relating $Z_{ICM}$ with the stellar fraction $M_*/M_{gas}$. We determine $Z_{ICM}$ via spectral fitting across multiple annuli finding a best fit of $Z_{ICM} = -0.08^{+0.07}_{-0.07}\, log\left(\frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right) + 0.30^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ with intrinsic scatter $\sigma_p = 0.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$. We use closed-box chemical evolution models to estimate the metallicity yield from observable stellar populations, incorporating updated supernova yields and corrections for metals locked in remnants, $Z_* = (1.14 \pm 0.52) \, log\left(1 + \frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right)$. Our results demonstrate that present-day stellar populations systematically underpredict $Z_{ICM}$, with an inferred excess component increasing in systems with low $M_*/M_{gas}$. This trend supports the need for an early enrichment population (EEP) distinct from visible stars, $Z_{EEP}$. We find this necessity holds when reconsidering the closed-box assumption by removing all galaxy groups, potential leaky systems, deriving $Z_{EEP}$ within $1\sigma$ when including and excluding groups. Three systems (NGC1132, NGC5098, and NGC4325) deviate from the survey trend, exhibiting steep negative radial metallicity gradients and unusually low $Z_{ICM}$. We posit these systems to be late-forming whose ICM enrichment reflects only recent stellar populations. Our analysis quantifies the necessity of an EEP and provides trends for testing cluster chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>Two-beam Multiparticle Many-body simulations of Inhomogeneous FFI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor evolution in dense astrophysical environments is inherently nonlinear and sensitive to many-body (MB) quantum effects beyond the mean-field (MF) approximation. Existing MB studies are constrained by small system sizes, closed boundaries, and highly idealized symmetry assumptions. We present a unified tensor-network framework that enables simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flavor evolution under conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Within this framework, we examine the effects of inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, and convergence with resolution for multiple neutrino distributions, allowing direct comparison of these setups under one consistent formulation. In our simulations, many-body systems equilibrate earlier than their mean-field counterparts while approaching similar final flavor states. Enlarging the interaction region allows open boundaries to reproduce closed-system behavior, but only when the beams begin superimposed and interact continuously. By contrast, initially separated configurations develop entanglement more slowly, interact over longer times, and equilibrate to a flavor content that differs from that obtained from initially superimposed calculations.</description>

      <title>Neutron star heating vs. HST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passively cooling neutron stars (NSs) should reach undetectably low surface temperatures $T_s&lt;10^4$ K in less than $10^7$ yr. However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $\Delta_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.</description>

      <title>A Core-Collapse Supernova Neutrino Parameterization with Enhanced Physical Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel parameterization of supernova neutrino energy spectra with a clear physical motivation. Its central parameter, $\tau(t)$, quantifies the characteristic thermal-diffusion area during the explosion. When applied to the historic SN1987A data, this parameterization yields statistically significant fits and provides robust constraints on the unobserved low-energy portion of the spectrum. Beyond this specific application, we demonstrate the model's power on a suite of 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, finding that the temporal evolution of $\tau(t)$ distinctly separates successful from failed explosions. Furthermore, we constrain the progenitor mass of SN 1987A to approximately 19 solar masses by applying Smoothed Isotonic Regression, while noting the sensitivity of this estimate to observational uncertainties. Moreover, in these simulations, $\tau(t)$ and the gravitational-wave strain amplitude display a strong, synergistic co-evolution, directly linking the engine's energetic evolution to its geometric asymmetry. This implies that the thermodynamic state of the explosion is imprinted not only on the escaping neutrino flux, but also recorded in the shape of the energy spectrum. Our framework therefore offers a valuable tool for decoding the detailed core dynamics and multi-messenger processes of future galactic supernovae.</description>

      <title>Lucky Strikes: On the Origins of GW190814 Through Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymmetric nature of GW190814, particularly its mass ratio ($q \approx 1/10$), has made its astrophysical origin elusive. We explore isolated binary evolution as a potential explanation for GW190814's formation. Using the binary population synthesis code COSMIC, and the backpop sampling technique to map the observed parameters of GW190814 to the initial conditions of Zero Age Main Sequence binary stars while simultaneously inferring the astrophysical prescriptions for common envelope evolution, stable mass transfer and natal kick kinematics that are needed for its formation and eventual merger. We find that the initial conditions for the binary stellar population that forms GW190814 do not stand out significantly from massive star populations observed in the Local Group. Our backpop simulations recover a dominant formation pathway where the first Roche overflow phase includes a common envelope evolution and the second Roche overflow phase remains stable. Our findings suggest that natal kicks imparted during compact object formation play the strongest role in forming GW190814-like systems. Specifically, our models require a low magnitude first natal kick (independent of direction) that prevents the binary from unbinding and a large second natal kick with its direction in the plane of the orbit and toward the binary's center of mass. The second natal kick strength and direction crucially increases the orbital eccentricity, leading to shorter delay times, and thus enabling mergers within a Hubble time. We estimate the chance probability for GW190814-like events that experience such a lucky kick and find that it occurs in $\sim20\%$ of systems if natal kicks are randomly oriented. We discuss the astrophysical implications for the formation of asymmetric GW190814-like systems under the context of binary stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Trading oxygen for iron II. Oxygen- versus iron-dependent cosmic star formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their different nucleosynthetic origin, a stellar population produces oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) on different timescales and their relative abundance can deviate strongly from solar. Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived &lt;[Fe/H]&gt; from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers).</description>

      <title>Teukolsky by Design: A Hybrid Spectral-PINN solver for Kerr Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SpectralPINN, a hybrid pseudo-spectral/physics-informed neural network (PINN) solver for Kerr quasinormal modes that targets the Teukolsky equation in both the separated (radial/angular) and joint two-dimensional formulations. The solver replaces standard neural activation functions with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and supports both soft -- via loss penalties -- and hard -- enforced by analytic masks -- implementations of Leaver's normalization. Benchmarking against Leaver's continued-fraction method shows cumulative (real+imaginary part) relative frequency errors of $\sim 0.001\%$ for the separated formulation with hard normalization, $\sim 0.1\%$ for both the soft separated and soft joint formulations, and $\sim 0.01\%$ for the hard joint case. Exploiting our ability to solve the joint equation, we add a small quadrupolar perturbation to the Teukolsky operator, effectively rendering the problem non-separable. The resulting perturbed quasinormal modes are compared against the expected precision of the Einstein Telescope, allowing us to constrain the magnitude of the perturbation. These proof-of-concept results demonstrate that hybrid spectral-PINN solvers can provide a flexible pathway to quasinormal spectra in settings where separability, asymptotics, or field content become more intricate and high accuracy is required.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Chemical Enrichment in the Abell 2029 Core with XRISM, XMM-Newton, and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the chemical abundance pattern in the core of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell~2029, based on XRISM observations with Resolve (37 ks) and Xtend (500 ks), combined with archival data from XMM-Newton (EPIC, RGS) and Chandra. Fe abundances derived from Resolve, Xtend, and EPIC are broadly consistent, while RGS gives systematically lower values. Because the XRISM gate valve remained closed during these observations, Resolve spectral fitting is restricted to the 2--10 keV band, providing reliable constraints only for elements with strong lines in this band (S, Ar, Ca, Fe, Ni). Abundances of the $\alpha$-elements are therefore derived using complementary observations from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra. We construct an average X/Fe pattern in the cluster core by using Resolve exclusively for S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe, and RGS + Xtend for O/Fe. The Ne/Fe ratio is averaged from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra measurements; Mg/Fe from EPIC and Chandra measurements; and Si/Fe from Xtend, EPIC, and Chandra. Comparison with the supernovae yield models indicates that the observed abundance pattern in A2029 core is best reproduced by a combination of core-collapsed yields from low-metallicity progenitors ($Z_{\rm init}=0.001$) and a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass, double-degenerate Type Ia model. Additionally, we find an excess in Ca abundance in the core of A2029 that cannot be reproduced by the standard supernovae yield models.</description>

      <title>Revised optical classification of a sample of gamma-ray emitting AGN with GTC and VLT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of the optical follow-up of a sample of $\gamma$-ray-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). New high-quality optical spectra were obtained using Gran Telescopio Canarias with Optical System for Imaging and low- Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 1 with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2. From the analysis of these spectra, we confirmed the previous classification as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) for four objects and discovered two new NLS1s, bringing the total number of optically confirmed $\gamma$-NLS1s to 26. We also identified two ambiguous cases between NLS1 and intermediate Seyfert (IS), three IS, one broad-line Seyfert 1, one Seyfert 2. Based on the new spectra, we calculated black hole masses ranging from $10^{6.25}$ to $10^{9.32}$ $M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios spanning 0.05 to 2.07. This reclassification reinforces the scenario in which AGN with relatively small black hole masses are capable of launching powerful relativistic jets, contributing to our broader understanding of $\gamma$-ray-emitting AGN.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Neutrino Observation and Mass Measurement from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the next decade, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) events are expected in Hyper-Kamiokande. Another neutrino source that has received far less attention is binary neutron star mergers. Including the data from recent simulations, we find that detection in current and near-future neutrino experiments is not feasible, and a megaton-scale detector with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV threshold, such as the proposed Deep-TITAND, MEMPHYS, or MICA, will be required. This is due to the updated binary neutron star merger rate and the time-of-flight delay caused by the nonzero neutrino mass. Regarding the former, recent results from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has significantly lowered the upper limit on the neutron star merger rate. As for the latter, neutrino events from neutron star mergers are expected to be recorded shortly after the gravitational wave signal. Limiting the analysis to such short time windows can significantly reduce background rates. While this approach has been qualitatively discussed in the literature, the effect of the time delay caused by neutrino mass, which can substantially extend the observation windows, has been disregarded. We present a refined analysis employing energy-dependent time windows and luminosity distance cuts for the mergers and provide realistic estimates of the detector runtime required to record neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers with small background contamination. The relative timing between the neutrino and gravitational wave signals can also be employed to probe the scale of neutrino mass. We find that the sensitivity to the lightest neutrino mass exceeds both the most stringent terrestrial bounds from KATRIN and the projections based on galactic supernovae. This level of sensitivity may become particularly relevant in the future if terrestrial and supernova constraints are not significantly improved.</description>

      <title>Mirage Sources and Large TeV Halo-Pulsar Offsets: Exploring the Parameter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric propagation of 100 TeV electrons (whose radiation mainly concentrates on 20--30 TeV) in turbulent magnetic fields around pulsars, using GPU-accelerated simulations to explore their trajectories and interactions within pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium. Key results include the identification of ``mirage'' sources indicating significant offsets in high-energy emissions from their originating pulsars, challenging the results of traditional symmetric diffusion models. By varying parameters like source distance, magnetic field strength, and electron injection spectral index, the study delineates their effects on observable phenomena such as the probability that a source has at least one mirage around it, as well as the source separation. Our results offer insights into some puzzling sources observed recently by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), and shed light on the cosmic-ray transport mechanism in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an equation of state formalism for hot Neutron Stars (NSs) which consistently includes the effects of finite temperature, hyperons as well as neutrino trapping, relevant for the study of proto-neutron stars, binary neutron star mergers and supernova explosions. Within a non-linear relativistic mean field description, the framework allows for a systematic variation of nuclear parameters within the range allowed by uncertainties in nuclear experimental data, ensuring compatibility with nuclear theory, astrophysical and heavy-ion data. We then investigate the role of nuclear and hypernuclear parameters as well as thermal effects on NS macroscopic properties and $f$-mode oscillations in hot neutron stars within Cowling approximation. Our results reveal that in hyperonic neutron stars with trapped neutrinos, the saturation nuclear density shows moderate to strong correlation with NS astrophysical observables. We also investigate whether thermal effects break universal relations and provide fit relations for hot NS configurations in the neutrino-trapped regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays can trigger electromagnetic cascades via pair production on ambient photons, reprocessing their energy to lower frequencies. A classic example is the cascade from the gamma rays produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in extragalactic photon fields, whose universal spectral shape was first described by Berezinsky in the 1970s. Recently, internal cascades, developing within the gamma-ray sources themselves, have gained a prominent role, as the IceCube data suggest that most detected neutrinos originate in gamma-ray-opaque environments. We analyze under what conditions these internal cascades can approach a universal spectrum. Since the Berezinsky treatment breaks down if synchrotron losses dominate, we present a generalized theory incorporating synchrotron-dominated cascades. We show the emergence of universal cascade spectrum among various examples of high-energy sources containing non-thermal cosmic rays, and discuss the conditions for its appearance.</description>

      <title>Black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 shows simultaneous Type-B and Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations across the hard-intermediate and soft-intermediate states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a timing analysis of \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations of the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across a bright soft X-ray flare on 2023 September 19 (MJD 60206). At the peak of the flare, the source undergoes a brief transition from the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) into the soft-intermediate state (SIMS), marked by the simultaneous appearance of three discrete radio jet ejections, a drop in broadband noise in the 2$-$10 keV band, and the presence of a narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a characteristic ``U''-shaped phase-lag spectrum and a quality factor of $Q \geq 6$, features that robustly identify it as a Type-B QPO. The Type-C QPO, which was clearly detected in the HIMS prior to the flare, is not observed at the flare's peak and only reappears afterward. Most notably, we find that the Type-B QPO is not restricted to the SIMS: it is present throughout all our observations, including those taken in the HIMS, where it appears as a broad shoulder of the Type-C QPO. During the flare, the Type-B and Type-C QPOs exhibit distinct evolutionary trends in frequency, fractional rms amplitude, and phase lag. These results challenge the traditional view that Type-B QPOs are exclusive to the SIMS, a state that is, in fact, defined by their appearance in the power spectrum, and directly linked to discrete jet ejections. Instead, our findings suggest that the physical conditions giving rise to Type-B QPOs occur more broadly within the inner accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting asteroid-mass primordial black holes in extreme mass-ratio inspirals with continuous gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the existence of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) remains almost completely unconstrained and thus could still comprise the totality of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we show that standard searches for continuous gravitational waves -- long-lived, quasi-monochromatic signals -- could detect extreme mass-ratio inspirals of asteroid-mass PBHs in orbit around a stellar-mass companion using future gravitational-wave (GW) data from Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO). We evaluate the robustness of our projected constraints against the eccentricity of the binary, the choice of the mass of the primary object, and the GW frequency range that we analyze. Furthermore, to determine whether there could be ways to detect asteroid-mass PBHs using current GW data, we quantify the impact of changes in current techniques on the sensitivity towards asteroid-mass PBHs. We show that methods that allow for signals with increased and more complicated frequency drifts over time could obtain much more stringent constraints now than those derived from standard techniques, though at slightly larger computational cost, potentially constraining the fraction of DM that certain asteroid-mass PBHs could compose to be less than one with current detectors.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial orbits around Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial orbits in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer by feebly interacting particles in supernovae: the trapping regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feebly interacting particles, such as sterile neutrinos, dark photons, and axions, can be abundantly produced in the proto-neutron star (PNS) formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). These particles can decay into photons or charged leptons, depositing energy outside the PNS. Strong bounds on new particles can thus be derived from the observed luminosity of CCSNe, with even tighter bounds obtained from low-energy SNe observations. For the first time we highlight that, at sufficiently large couplings, particle production \textit{outside} the PNS must also be considered. Using the prototypical case of axions coupling to two photons, we show that at large couplings the energy transfer from PNS to its surroundings is diffusive rather than ballistic, substantially reducing the deposited energy. Our findings have implications for the parameter space of particles probed in beam dump experiments and for dark matter models involving a sub-GeV mediator.</description>

      <title>Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.</description>

      <title>Leading bounds on micro- to picometer fifth forces from neutron star cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equivalence principle and the inverse-square law of gravity could be violated at short distances ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-12}$ meters) by scalars sporting a coupling $g_N$ to nucleons and mass $\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_\phi\lesssim\rm MeV$. We show for the first time that stringent bounds on the existence of these scalars can be derived from the observed cooling of nearby isolated neutron stars (NSs). Although NSs can only be used to set limits comparable to the classic SN 1987A cooling bound in the case of pseudoscalars such as the QCD axion, the shallow temperature dependence of the scalar emissivity results in a huge enhancement in the effect of $\phi$ on the cooling of cold NSs. As we do not find evidence of exotic energy losses, we can exclude couplings down to $g_N\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-14}$. Our new bound supersedes all existing limits on scalars across six orders of magnitude in $m_\phi$. These conclusions also extend to Higgs-portal models, for which the bound on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle is $\sin\theta\lesssim 6\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Mass-Driven Instabilities as the Earliest Flavor Conversion in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small antineutrino flux of opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

      <title>Heat propagation in rotating relativistic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate heat propagation in rigidly rotating bodies within the theory of general relativity. Using a first-order gradient expansion, we derive a universal partial differential equation governing the temperature evolution. This equation is hyperbolic, causal, and stable, and it naturally accounts for both rotational and gravitational Tolman-Ehrenfest effects. Any other first-order theory consistent with established physics (including the parabolic theories used in neutron star cooling models) must be equivalent to our formulation within an error that is of higher order in gradients. As a case study, we analyze heat transfer in solid cylinders rotating around their symmetry axis, so that the tangential speed approaches the speed of light on the surface. We also compute the relativistic rotational corrections to the cooling law of black bodies.</description>

      <title>POLAR-2 -- Latest Developments of the Next Generation GRB Polarimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027. Currently, POLAR-2 is in its production phase with the first module targets being produced. We will provide an overview of the current status of the development.</description>

      <title>Type Iax supernovae as a source of iron-rich silicate dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.</description>
