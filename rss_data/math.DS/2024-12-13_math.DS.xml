      <title>Topology of zero sets of polynomials with square discriminant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{N} \neq \{0\}$ be a fixed set of integers, closed under multiplication, closed under negation, or containing $\{\pm 1\}$. We prove that any zero of a polynomial in $\mathbf{Z}[X]$ whose coefficients lie in $\mathcal{N}$ can be approximated in $\mathbf{C}$ to arbitrary precision by a zero of a polynomial in $\mathbf{Z}[X]$ with square discriminant whose coefficients also lie in $\mathcal{N}$. Hence the topology of the closure in $\mathbf{C}$ of the set of zeros of all such polynomials is insensitive to the discriminant being a square, in contrast to the Galois groups of the polynomials.</description>

      <title>Multiple partial rigidity rates in low complexity subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial rigidity is a quantitative notion of recurrence and provides a global obstruction which prevents the system from being strongly mixing. A dynamical system $(X, \mathcal{X}, \mu, T)$ is partially rigid if there is a constant $\delta &gt;0$ and sequence $(n_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $\displaystyle \liminf_{k \to \infty } \mu(A \cap T^{n_k}A) \geq \delta \mu(A)$ for every $A \in \mathcal{X}$, and the partial rigidity rate is the largest $\delta$ achieved over all sequences. For every integer $d \geq 1$, via an explicit construction, we prove the existence of a minimal subshift $(X,S)$ with $d$ ergodic measures having distinct partial rigidity rates. The systems built are $\mathcal{S}$-adic subshifts of finite alphabetic rank that have non-superlinear word complexity and, in particular, have zero entropy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Linear Chain Trick in epidemiological models: Implications of underlying assumptions for numerical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to simulate the spread of infectious diseases, many epidemiological models use systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the underlying dynamics. These models incorporate the implicit assumption, that the stay time in each disease state follows an exponential distribution. However, a substantial number of epidemiological, data-based studies indicate that this assumption is not plausible. One method to alleviate this limitation is to employ the Linear Chain Trick (LCT) for ODE systems, which realizes the use of Erlang distributed stay times. As indicated by data, this approach allows for more realistic models while maintaining the advantages of using ODEs.
  In this work, we propose an advanced LCT model incorporating eight infection states with demographic stratification. We review key properties of LCT models and demonstrate that predictions derived from a simple ODE-based model can be significantly distorted, potentially leading to wrong political decisions. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of distribution assumptions on the behavior at change points and on the prediction of epidemic peaks is substantial, while the assumption has no effect on the final size of the epidemic. As the corresponding ODE systems are often solved by adaptive Runge-Kutta methods such as the Cash Karp method, we also study the implications on the time-to-solution using Cash Karp 5(4) for different LCT models. Eventually and for the application side, we highlight the importance of incorporating a demographic stratification by age groups to improve the prediction performance of the model. We validate our model by showing that realistic infection dynamics are better captured by LCT models than by a simple ODE model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of centers by its complex separatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we deal with analytic families of real planar vector fields $\mathcal{X}_\lambda$ having a monodromic singularity at the origin for any $\lambda \in \Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ and depending analytically on the parameters $\lambda$. There naturally appears the so-called center-focus problem which consists in describing the partition of $\Lambda$ induced by the centers and the foci at the origin. We give a characterization of the centers (degenerated or not) in terms of a specific integral of the cofactor associated to a real invariant analytic curve passing through the singularity, which always exists. Several consequences and applications are also stated.</description>

      <title>Principal Bautin ideal of monodromic singularities with inverse integrating factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the structure of the Poincar\'e map $\Pi$ associated to a monodromic singularity of an analytic family of planar vector fields. We work under two assumptions. The first one is that the family possesses an inverse integrating factor that can be expanded in Laurent series centered at the singularity after a weighted polar blow-up fixed by the Newton diagram of the family. The second one is that we restrict our analysis to a subset of the monodromic parameter space that assures the non-existence of local curves with zero angular speed. The conclusions are that the asymptotic Dulac expansion of $\Pi$ does not contain logarithmic terms, indeed it admits a formal power series expansion with a unique independent generalized Poincar\'e-Lyapunov quantity, which can be computed under some explicit conditions. Moreover we also give conditions that guarantee the analyticity of $\Pi$, in which case we show that the Bautin ideal is principal and therefore the cyclicity of the singularity with respect to perturbation within the family is zero.</description>

      <title>On the metric mean dimensions of saturated sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturated sets and its reduced case the set of generic points are two types of important fractal-like sets in Multifractal analysis of dynamical systems. In the context of infinite entropy systems, this paper aims to give some qualitative aspects of saturated sets and the set generic points in both topological and measure-theoretic situations. For systems with specification property, we establish the certain variational principles for saturated sets in terms of Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions, and show the upper capacity metric mean dimension of saturated sets have full metric mean dimension. All results are useful for understanding the topological structures of dynamical systems with infinite topological entropy.
  As applications, we further exhibit some qualitative aspects of metric mean dimensions of level sets and the set of mean Li-Yorke pairs in infinite entropy systems.</description>

      <title>A conceptual framework for modeling a latching mechanism for cell cycle regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two identical van der Pol oscillators with mutual inhibition are considered as a conceptual framework for modeling a latching mechanism for cell cycle regulation. In particular, the oscillators are biased to a latched state in which there is a globally attracting steady-state equilibrium without coupling. The inhibitory coupling induces stable alternating large-amplitude oscillations that model the normal cell cycle. A homoclinic bifurcation within the model is found to be responsible for the transition from normal cell cycling to endocycles in which only one of the two oscillators undergoes large-amplitude oscillations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Tits alternative for circle diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ be finitely supported probability measures on $\mathrm{Diff}^1_+(S^1)$ such that their supports genererate groups acting proximally on $S^1$. Let $f^n_\omega, f^n_{\omega'}, n \in \mathbb{N}$ be two independent realizations of the random walk driven by $\mu_1, \mu_2$ respectively. We show that almost surely there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq N$ the elements $f^n_\omega, f^n_{\omega'}$ generate a nonabelian free group. The proof adapts the strategy by R. Aoun for linear groups and work of A. Gorodetski, V. Kleptsyn and G. Monakov, and of K. Gelfert and G. Salcedo. The theorem is still true for infinitely supported measures on $\mathrm{Diff}_+^{1 + \tau}(S^1)$ subject to moment conditions, and a weaker but similar statement holds for measures supported on $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ with no moment conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tits alternative for groups of almost automorphisms of trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a dynamical variant of the Tits alternative for the group of almost automorphisms of a locally finite tree $\mathcal{T}$: a group of almost automorphisms of $\mathcal{T}$ either contains a nonabelian free group playing ping-pong on the boundary $\partial \mathcal{T}$, or the action of the group on $\partial \mathcal{T}$ preserves a probability measure. This generalises to all groups of tree almost automorphisms a result of S. Hurtado and E. Militon for Thompson's group $V$, with a hopefully simpler proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A.Olevskii and A.Ulanovskii obtained a scale of density results, which correspond to how well an exponential system approximates a uniformly minimal system over a compact set. We extend their result in several directions. First, we show that it holds for any set of positive finite measure. Next, we consider a relaxed version of frames, which we term 'uniformly complete systems', and obtain an analogues scale of density results for such systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Threshold Dynamics Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, inspired by the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) algorithm and by cellular automatons, to model and learn threshold dynamics for front evolution from video data. The first model, termed the (single-dynamics) MBO network, learns a specific kernel and threshold for each input video without adapting to new dynamics, while the second, a meta-learning MBO network, generalizes across diverse threshold dynamics by adapting its parameters per input. Both models are evaluated on synthetic and real-world videos (ice melting and fire front propagation), with performance metrics indicating effective reconstruction and extrapolation of evolving boundaries, even under noisy conditions. Empirical results highlight the robustness of both networks across varied synthetic and real-world dynamics.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Pools as Mean Field Games: A New Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an innovative application of the probabilistic weak formulation of mean field games (MFG) for modeling liquidity pools in a constant product automated market maker (AMM) protocol in the context of decentralized finance. Our work extends one of the most conventional applications of MFG, which is the price impact model in an order book, by incorporating an AMM instead of a traditional order book. Through our approach, we achieve results that support the existence of solutions to the Mean Field Game and, additionally, the existence of approximate Nash equilibria for the proposed problem. These results not only offer a new perspective for representing liquidity pools in AMMs but also open promising opportunities for future research in this emerging field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.09259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study stable ergodicity of the action of groups of diffeomorphisms on smooth manifolds. Such actions are known to exist only on one-dimensional manifolds. The aim of this paper is to introduce a geometric method to overcome this restriction and to construct higher dimensional examples. In particular, we show that every closed manifold admits stably ergodic finitely generated group actions by diffeomorphisms of class $C^{1+\alpha}$. We also prove the stable ergodicity of certain algebraic actions, including the natural action of a generic pair of matrices near the identity on a sphere of arbitrary dimension. These are consequences of the quasi-conformal blender, a local and stable mechanism/phenomenon introduced in this paper, which encapsulates our method for proving stable local ergodicity by providing quasi-conformal orbits with fine controlled geometry. The quasi-conformal blender is developed in the context of pseudo-semigroup actions of locally defined smooth diffeomorphisms, which allows for applications in diverse settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the feedback global stabilization and observer construction for a sterile insect technique model. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is one of the most ecological methods for controlling insect pests responsible for worldwide crop destruction and disease transmission. In this work, we construct a feedback law that globally asymptotically stabilizes a SIT model at extinction equilibrium. Since the application of this type of control requires the measurement of different states of the target insect population, and in practice, some states are more difficult and very expensive to measure than others, it is important to know how to construct a state estimator which from a few measured states, estimates the other ones as the one we build in the second part of our work. In the last part of our work, we show that we can apply the feedback control with estimated states to stabilize the full system.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Attractors for Singularly Perturbed Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singularly perturbed dynamical systems, commonly known as fast-slow systems, play a crucial role in various applications such as plasma physics. They are closely related to reduced order modeling, closures, and structure-preserving numerical algorithms for multiscale modeling. A powerful and well-known tool to address these systems is the Fenichel normal form, which significantly simplifies fast dynamics near slow manifolds through a transformation. However, the Fenichel normal form is difficult to realize in conventional numerical algorithms. In this work, we explore an alternative way of realizing it through structure-preserving machine learning. Specifically, a fast-slow neural network (FSNN) is proposed for learning data-driven models of singularly perturbed dynamical systems with dissipative fast timescale dynamics. Our method enforces the existence of a trainable, attracting invariant slow manifold as a hard constraint. Closed-form representation of the slow manifold enables efficient integration on the slow time scale and significantly improves prediction accuracy beyond the training data. We demonstrate the FSNN on several examples that exhibit multiple timescales, including the Grad moment system from hydrodynamics, two-scale Lorentz96 equations for modeling atmospheric dynamics, and Abraham-Lorentz dynamics modeling radiation reaction of electrons in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>On divergent on average trajectories for higher rank actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $d\ge 3$ we first show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $A$-divergent on average points in the $(d-1)$-dimensional closed horosphere in the space of $d$-dimensional Euclidean lattices, where $A$ is the group of positive diagonal matrices, is at most $\frac{d-1}{2}$. In particular, this upper bound is sharp for $d=3$.
  We apply this to compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of exceptions to the inhomogeneous uniform version of Littlewood conjecture. We say that a pair $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfies the inhomogeneous Littlewood conjecture if $$\liminf_{q\to\infty}q\|q\xi_1-\theta_1\|_{\mathbb{Z}}\|q\xi_2-\theta_2\|_{\mathbb{Z}}=0$$ for all $(\theta_1,\theta_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\|\cdot\|_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the distance to the nearest integer. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of pairs $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ not satisfying the inhomogeneous Littlewood conjecture is $1$, which is equal to the Hausdorff dimension of the conjectural set of exceptions.</description>

      <title>Moments of Margulis functions and indefinite ternary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the moments of the Margulis $\alpha$-function integrating over expanding translates of a unipotent orbit in $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$. We show that for some $\lambda&gt;1$ the $\lambda$-moments of the Margulis $\alpha$-function over expanding translates of a unipotent orbit are uniformly bounded, under suitable Diophantine conditions of the initial unipotent orbit.
  As an application, we prove that for any indefinite irrational ternary quadratic form $Q$ with suitable Diophantine conditions and $a&lt;b$ the number of integral vectors of norm at most $T$ satisfying $a&lt;Q(v)&lt;b$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\mathsf{C}_Q(b-a)T$ as $T$ tends to infinity, where the constant $\mathsf{C}_Q&gt;0$ depends only on $Q$.</description>

      <title>An exact solution for a non-autonomous delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution for a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation (DDE) over the entire real-time axis, representing it as a sum of Gaussian-shaped dynamics with distinct peak positions. This marks the first explicit solution for non-autonomous DDEs and is a rare example even among general DDEs. The constructed solution offers key physical insights and facilitates the analysis of system properties, such as the envelope profile of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Barcode entropy of geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the barcode entropy for geodesic flows of closed Riemannian manifolds, which measures the exponential growth rate of the number of not-too-short bars in the Morse-theoretic barcode of the energy functional. We prove that the barcode entropy bounds from below the topological entropy of the geodesic flow and, conversely, bounds from above the topological entropy of any hyperbolic compact invariant set. As a consequence, for Riemannian metrics on surfaces, the barcode entropy is equal to the topological entropy. A key to the proofs and of independent interest is a crossing energy theorem for gradient flow lines of the energy functional.</description>

      <title>On structural contraction of biological interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological networks function extremely well under severe forms of pertubations affecting both the concentrations and the kinetic parameters. Structural dynamical robustness has been proposed as a defining feature of such networks. In this paper, we propose the notion of structural contractivity. We build on the previous work of the authors which characterized the long-term dynamics of classes of Biological Interaction Networks (BINs), based on "rate-dependent Lyapunov functions". Here, we show that stronger notions of convergence can be established by proving structural contractivity with respect to non-standard polyhederal $\ell_\infty$-norms. In particular, we show that such networks are non-expansive. With additional verifiable conditions, we show that they are strictly contractive over arbitrary positive compact sets. In addition, we show that such networks entrain to periodic inputs. We illustrate our theory with examples from signaling pathways.</description>

      <title>A lower bound for the volumes of modular link complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every finite collection of oriented closed geodesics in the modular surface has a canonically associated link in its unit tangent bundle coming from the periodic orbits of the geodesic flow. We study the volume of the associated link complement with respect to its unique complete hyperbolic metric. We provide the first lower volume bound that is linear in terms of the number of distinct exponents in the code words corresponding to the collection of closed geodesics.</description>

      <title>On non-uniqueness of solitary waves on two-dimensional rotational flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider solitary water waves on a rotational, unidirectional flow in a two-dimensional channel of finite depth. Ovsyannikov has conjectured in 1983 that the solitary wave is uniquely determined by the Bernoulli constant, mass flux and by the flow force. This conjecture was disproved by Plotnikov in 1992 for the ir-rotational flow. In this paper we show that this conjecture is wrong also for rotational flows. Moreover we prove that in any neighborhood of the first bifurcation point on the branch of solitary waves, approaching the extreme wave, there are infinitely many pairs of solitary waves corresponding to the same Bernoulli constant. We give a description of the structure of this set of pairs. The proof is based on a bifurcation analysis of the global branch of solitary waves which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lunar Power Grid: Network Structure and Spontaneous Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving stable synchronized operation in an alternating current power network is critical to the continuity and reliability of energy delivery. In this paper, we study a dynamic model for synchronization in the proposed power network which the National Aeronautic and Space Agency plans to build on the lunar surface to support continuous human presence on the Moon and a lunar economy. This network is quite remarkable in the sense that it is expected to be the first power network to operate at the unprecedented operating frequency in the $\text{kHz}$ range. The particular structure of this network allows us to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of a unique locally stable synchronized mode, which will provide a passive control mechanism for the system. Furthermore, we study the bifurcation process leading to the loss of synchronization when the system parameters fall outside of the stable regime. Our results have broader implications for many complex networks with parametric heterogeneity to enhance stability and resilience.</description>
