      <title>Renormalization of nonlocal gluon operators on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalization of a complete set of gauge-invariant gluon nonlocal operators in lattice perturbation theory. We determine the mixing pattern under renormalization of these operators using symmetry arguments, which extend beyond perturbation theory. Additionally, we derive the renormalization factors of the operators within the modified Minimal Subtraction $(\rm \overline{MS})$ scheme up to one-loop. To enable a non-perturbative renormalization procedure, we investigate a suitable version of the modified regularization-invariant (${\rm RI}'$) scheme, and we calculate the conversion factors from that scheme to $\rm\overline{MS}$. The computations are performed by employing both dimensional and lattice regularizations, using the Wilson gluon action. This work is relevant to nonperturbative studies of the gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of the three-dimensional SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories with the reduced tensor network formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>Thermal state preparation of the SYK model using a variational quantum algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the preparation of thermal states of the dense and sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model using a variational quantum algorithm for $6 \le N \le 12$ Majorana fermions over a wide range of temperatures. Utilizing IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor, we perform benchmark computations for the dense SYK model with $N = 6$, showing good agreement with exact results. The preparation of thermal states of a non-local random Hamiltonian with all-to-all coupling using the simulator and quantum hardware represents a significant step toward future computations of thermal out-of-time order correlators in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.</description>

      <title>Theory Driven Evolution of the Weak Mixing Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first purely theoretical calculation of the weak mixing angle in the MS scheme at low energies by combining results from lattice QCD with perturbation theory. We discuss its correlation with the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and to the energy dependence of the electromagnetic coupling. We also compare the results with calculations using cross-section data as input. Implications for the Standard Model prediction of the mass of the W boson are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the proton from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of a hadron encode fundamental aspects of its structure, including its shape and size as defined from e.g., its energy density. This work presents a determination of the flavor decomposition of the GFFs of the proton from lattice QCD, in the kinematic region $0\leq -t\leq 2~\text{GeV}^2$. The decomposition into up-, down-, strange-quark, and gluon contributions provides first-principles constraints on the role of each constituent in generating key proton structure observables, such as its mechanical radius, mass radius, and $D$-term.</description>

      <title>Vector $K^{*}$ mesons in external magnetic field from SU(3) gluodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the ground state energies of the neutral and charged vector $K^{*}$ mesons in the external abelian magnetic field of QCD scale using overlap fermions. We attempt to calculate the magnetic moment and the magnetic dipole polarizability of the $K^{*0}$ and $\bar{K}^{*0}$ mesons and investigate their dependence on the ratio of the strange quark mass to the light quark mass. It is found that the ground state energy and the magnetic dipole polarizability depends on the meson spin projection on the magnetic field axis. This leads to the appearance of dileptonic asymmetry, which can be characterized by the tensor polarizability estimated for the $K^{*0}$ mesons. We obtain that the $g$-factor of the vector $K^{*\pm}$ mesons depends on the $m_s/m_u$ value. Also we do not observe any evidence of the tachyon mode existence for the strange vector mesons.</description>

      <title>Anomalous localization in spin chains with tilted interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories involve dynamics of typically short-ranged interacting particles and dynamical fields. Elimination of the latter via Gauss law leads to infinite range interactions as exemplified by the Schwinger model in a staggered formalism. This motivates the study of long-range interactions, not necessarily diminishing with the distance. Here we consider localization properties of a spin chain with interaction strength growing linearly along the chain as for the Schwinger model. We generalize the problem to models with different interaction ranges. Using exact diagonalization we find the participation ratio of all eigenstates, which allows us to quantify the localization volume in Hilbert space. Surprisingly, the localization volume changes nonmonotonically with the interaction range. Our study is relevant for quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories implemented in state-of-the-art cold atom/ion devices, and it could help to reveal hidden features in disorder-free confinement phenomena in long-range interacting systems.</description>
