      <title>A numerical study on the effect of rolling friction on clogging of pores in particle-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particulate matter in a fluid injected into a porous reservoir impairs its permeability spatio-temporally due to pore clogging. As particle volume fraction increases near the pore throats, inter-particle contact mechanics determine their jamming and subsequent pore clogging behavior. During contact of particles submerged in a fluid, in addition to sliding friction, a rolling resistance develops due to a several micromechanical and hydrodynamic factors. A coefficient of rolling friction is often used as a lumped parameter to characterize particle rigidity, particle shape, lubrication and fluid mediated resistance, however its direct influence on the clogging behavior is not well studied in literature. We study the effect of rolling resistance on the clogging behavior of a dense suspension at pore scale using direct numerical simulations (DNS). A discrete element method (DEM) library is developed and coupled with an open-source immersed boundary method (IBM) based solver to perform pore and particle resolved simulations. Several 3D validations are presented for the DEM library and the DEM-IBM coupling and the effect of rolling resistance on clogging at a pore entry is studied.</description>

      <title>Scale-resolving simulations and data-driven modal analysis of turbulent transonic buffet cells on infinite swept wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transonic airfoil buffet is a class of shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) known to exhibit self-sustained two-dimensional (2D) chordwise shock wave oscillations (Strouhal number St=0.05-0.1), and three-dimensional (3D) spanwise-modulated flow separation/reattachment (St=0.2-0.4). Due to computational cost, scale-resolving simulations of span-periodic configurations to date have been limited to narrow airfoils, insufficient to accommodate the 3D buffet cell instability reported in low-fidelity simulations and experiments. In this work, implicit large-eddy simulations (ILES) and modal analysis are performed on infinite wings up to AR=3 with sweep effects for the first time. Two flow conditions are examined, corresponding to minimally and largely separated mean flow at the shock location. For the minimally separated case, the shock dynamics remain essentially spanwise-uniform (quasi-2D), with only weak and intermittent separation cells confined to the trailing-edge region and exhibiting negligible interaction with the shock. In contrast, increased mean separation leads to the emergence of pronounced 3D buffet cells with a characteristic spanwise wavelength: 1-1.5c. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition reveals that a stationary low-frequency 3D separation mode previously identified on unswept wings (St=0.02) becomes a spanwise travelling mode as sweep is imposed, shifting monotonically to intermediate frequencies (St=0.06-0.35). The 2D shock mode is largely insensitive to sweep, whereas the frequency and energy content of the 3D mode increase with sweep while its wavelength remains unchanged. The results demonstrate that transonic buffet arises from the superposition of distinct but coupled 2D shock motion and separation-driven 3D instabilities, with mean flow separation at the shock identified as a necessary condition for dominant 3D buffet dynamics to emerge.</description>

      <title>Inertial Self-Caging: Dynamics of Macroscopic Swimmers at Moderate Reynolds Number Sustaining Chemical Wake Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled phoretic swimmers are generally studied in the laminar flow regime, where their low speed renders inertial effects negligible and trajectories highly predictable. This research tackles the challenge of propulsion in the inertial regime, at moderate Reynolds numbers (100 &lt; Re &lt; 200), where fluid dynamics becomes non-linear. By using a chemically driven macroscopic hydrogel this work demonstrates, through experiments and modeling, the existence of stable resonant states under confined geometry: as the swimmer circles, it interacts with its own lasting chemical wake. This chemical self-feedback creates a complex, stable motion characterized by both universal exponential speed decay with superimposed significant periodic speed oscillations. Furthermore, a critical threshold speed is identified, where the system abruptly transitions from the resonant oscillatory regime to a stochastic stop &amp; go behavior. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how chemical fields, hydrodynamic inertia, and confinement couple to determine the motion properties of high-speed active matter.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solutions of the Minimal Nonlinear Equation for the Yaw Response of Tail Fins and Wind Vanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical solutions for the yaw response of tail fins for small wind turbines, and wind vanes for wind direction measurement, are derived for any planform and any release angle $\gamma_0$. This extends current linear models limited to small $|\gamma_0|$ and low aspect ratio planforms. The equation studied here is the minimal form of the general second order equation for the yaw angle, $\gamma$, derived by Hammam and Wood (2023). The nonlinear damping is controlled by a small parameter that depends on the vortex flow coefficient, $K_v$, which is absent from all linear models. The minimal equation is analysed using perturbation techniques. A truncated series solution from the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolskii averaging method compares favourably with a numerical solution apart from some small deviations at large time. Another form of averaging due to Beecham and Titchener (1971) yields a compact solution in terms of the rate of amplitude decay, and the rate of change of phase angle. This allows the identification of an equivalent linear system with equivalent frequency and damping ratio. Two limiting analytic solutions for small and large $|\gamma_0|$ are obtained. The former is used to identify the model parameters from experimental data. Both approximate solutions showed that high $K_v$ is important for fast decay of yaw amplitude for tail fins at high $|\gamma_0|$. High aspect ratios for wind vanes would reduce the nonlinearity to minimize yaw error. Linear response that is independent of $K_v$ occurs whenever $\sin{(\pi \gamma_0)\approx \pi \gamma_0}$. Further, the low angle analytical solution allows an exact identification of the nonlinearity which could be used to extend the modelling of wind vanes to high $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry of particle motion in Stokesian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a differential geometric framework for the motion of a non-Brownian particle in the presence of fixed obstacles in a quiescent fluid, in the deterministic Stokesian regime. While the Helmholtz Minimum Dissipation Theorem suggests that the hydrodynamic resistance tensor $R_{ij}$ acts as the natural Riemannian metric of the fluid domain, we demonstrate that particle trajectories driven by constant external forces are \emph{not} geodesics of this pure resistance metric. Instead, they experience a geometric drift perpendicular to the geodesic path due to the manifold's curvature. To reconcile this, we introduce a unified geometric formalism, proving that physical trajectories are geodesics of a conformally scaled metric, $\tilde{g}_{ij} = \mathcal{D}(\mathbf{x})R_{ij}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the local power dissipation. This framework establishes that the affine parameter along the trajectory corresponds to the cumulative energy dissipated. We apply this theory to the scattering of a spherical particle by a fixed obstacle, showing that the previously derived trajectory of the particle is recovered as a direct consequence of the curvature of this dissipation-scaled manifold.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced motion of ciliates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time dynamics of flagellar and ciliary beating is often neglected in theories of microswimmers, with the most common models prescribing a time-constant actuation of the surrounding fluid. By explicitly introducing a metachronal wave, coarse-grained to a sinusoidal surface slip velocity, we show that a spatial resonance between the metachronal wave and the corrugation of a confining cylindrical channel enables a ciliate to swim even when it cannot move forward in a bulk fluid. Using lubrication theory, we reduce the problem to the Adler equation that reveals an oscillatory and ballistic swimming regime. Interestingly, a ciliate can even reverse its swimming direction in a corrugated channel compared to the bulk fluid.</description>

      <title>Dynamic stall reattachment revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic stall on airfoils is an undesirable and potentially dangerous phenomenon. The motto for aerodynamic systems with unsteadily moving wings, such as helicopters or wind turbines, is that prevention beats recovery. In case prevention fails or is not feasible, we need to know when recovery starts, how long it takes, and how we can improve it. This study revisits dynamic stall reattachment to identify the sequence of events during flow and load recovery and to characterise key observable features in the pressure, force, and flow field. Our analysis is based on time-resolved velocity field and surface pressure data obtained experimentally for a two-dimensional, sinusoidally pitching thin airfoil. Stall recovery is a transient process that does not start immediately when the angle of attack falls below the critical stall angle. The onset of recovery is delayed to angles below the critical stall angle and the duration of the reattachment delay decreases with increasing unsteadiness of the pitching motion. An angle of attack below the critical angle is a necessary, but not sufficient condition to initiate the stall recovery process. We identified a critical value of the leading-edge suction parameter, independent of the pitch rate, that is a threshold beyond which reattachment consistently initiates. Based on prominent changes in the evolution of the shear layer, the leading-edge suction, and the lift deficit due to stall, we divided the reattachment process into three stages: the reaction delay, wave propagation, and the relaxation stage, and extracted the characteristic features and time-scales for each stage.</description>

      <title>Standing-Wave Dynamics in Low-Frequency Breathing of a Turbulent Separation Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the low-frequency dynamics of a turbulent separation bubble (TSB) over a backward-facing ramp, with a focus on large-scale coherent structures associated with the so-called 'breathing motion'. Using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) in both streamwise and spanwise planes, we examine the role of sidewall confinement. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of the streamwise velocity field reveals a dominant low-rank mode at low Strouhal numbers ($St &lt; 0.05$), consistent with prior observations of TSB breathing. Strikingly, the spanwise-oriented PIV data uncover a previously unreported standing wave pattern, characterised by discrete spanwise wavenumbers and nodal/antinodal structures, suggesting the presence of spanwise resonance. To explain these observations, we construct a resolvent-based model that imposes free-slip conditions at the sidewall locations by superposing left- and right-traveling three-dimensional modes. The model accurately reproduces the measured SPOD modes, demonstrating that sidewall reflections lead to the formation of standing wave-like patterns. To gain further insight into the driving mechanisms of the low-frequency dynamics, a global stability analysis is performed, revealing a zero-frequency eigenmode whose growth rate depends on the spanwise wavenumber. This eigenmode originates from a centrifugal instability. Downstream, the associated coherent structures are further amplified through non-modal lift-up mechanisms. Our findings highlight the critical influence of spanwise boundary conditions on the selection and structure of low-frequency modes in TSBs. This has direct implications for both experimental and numerical studies, particularly those relying on spanwise-periodic boundary conditions, and offers a low-order framework for predicting sidewall-induced modal dynamics in separated flows.</description>

      <title>Fold catastrophe in breaking waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamical-systems perspective on wave breaking for ideal incompressible free-surface flows. By tracking the most energetic hotspot on the wave surface, we find that near breaking the surface slope m evolves on a fast timescale governed by the small parameter epsilon = (partial_z u)^(-1), the inverse vertical velocity gradient at the hotspot, while the focusing parameter A = (U - Ce)/(U - Creq) varies slowly and adiabatically. Here U is the horizontal fluid velocity at the energetic point, Ce its propagation speed, and Creq the equivalent crest speed. This slow-fast structure reveals a fold catastrophe in the (m, A) space whose boundary forms the geometric skeleton organizing the dynamics near breaking. Finite-time blowup occurs when the trajectory crosses this boundary, marking the onset of breaking.
  The inception of breaking is further characterized by crossing the slope threshold theta* = arctan(sqrt(2) - 1) = 22.5 degrees. This critical angle marks the maximum anisotropy that can be sustained between the Hessians of the velocity and pressure fields, reflecting an imbalance between kinetic and potential energy fluxes. The anisotropy of the velocity Hessian also gives rise to the classical 30-degree slope observed at the inflection point of steep waves near breaking inception. The crest height is limited by the maximum excess of kinetic over potential energy that the flow can sustain, beyond which breaking becomes inevitable. Wave breaking can also be interpreted as a gravity analogue of a collapsing black hole, with apparent and event horizons representing the onset and inception of breaking.</description>

      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase-Textured Complex Viscosity in Linear Viscous Flows: Non-Normality Without Advection, Corner Defects, and 3D Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic incompressible flow with a spatially resolved complex viscosity field $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$ and, at fixed forcing frequency $\omega&gt;0$, its constitutive phase texture $\varphi(\mathbf{x})=\arg\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$. In three-dimensional domains periodic in a spanwise direction $z$, $z$-dependence of $\mu^*$ converts coefficient multiplication into convolution in spanwise Fourier index, yielding an operator-valued Toeplitz/Laurent coupling of modes. Consequently, even spanwise-uniform forcing generically produces $\kappa\neq 0$ sidebands in the harmonic response as a \emph{linear, constitutive} effect.
  We place $\mu^*$ at the closure level $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}=2\,\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\mathbf{D}(\hat{\mathbf{v}})$, as the boundary value of the Laplace transform of a causal stress-memory kernel. Under the passivity condition $\Re\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\ge \mu_{\min}&gt;0$, the oscillatory Stokes/Oseen operators are realized as m-sectorial operators associated with coercive sectorial forms on bounded Lipschitz (including cornered) domains, yielding existence, uniqueness, and frequency-dependent stability bounds.
  Spatial variation of $\varphi$ renders the viscous operator intrinsically non-normal even in the absence of advection, so amplification is governed by resolvent geometry (and associated pseudospectra), not by eigenvalues alone. In the pure-phase class $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)=\mu_0(\omega)e^{i\varphi(\mathbf{x})}$, the texture strength is quantified by $\mu_0(\omega)\|\nabla\varphi\|_{L^\infty}$.</description>
