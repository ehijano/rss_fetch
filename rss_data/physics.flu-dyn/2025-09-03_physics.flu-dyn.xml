      <title>A semi-analytical approach to characterize high-frequency three-dimensional wave propagation through clamp-on flowmeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation analysis at high frequencies is essential for applications involving ultrasound waves, such as clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters. However, it is extremely challenging to perform a 3D transient analysis of a clamp-on flowmeter using standard tools such as finite element analysis (FEA) due to the enormous associated computational cost. In this study, we separate the clamp-on flowmeter into different domains and analyze them separately. Wave propagation in the fluid domain is analyzed via FEA at low frequencies (100 kHz, 200 kHz, and 500 kHz) and using ray tracing at high frequencies (1 MHz). The behavior in the solid domain (wedges and pipe wall) is analytically characterized via geometric projection. All these individual analyses provide us with different scaling factors with which the waves in the respective domains scale when 3D effects are considered. The complete clamp-on system is then analyzed in 2D via the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to obtain the response at the receiver. The receiving signal is then scaled using the aforementioned scaling factors to accurately capture the wave propagation behavior of the clamp-on system in 3D. The output signal from the 2D analysis then becomes much clearer so that the fluid signal can be identified straightforwardly, which would be nearly impossible otherwise.</description>

      <title>Statistical State Dynamics based study of Langmuir Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the ocean mixed layer is of central importance in determining the fluxes of momentum, heat, gases, and particulates between the ocean and the atmosphere. A prominent component of mixed layer dynamics is the appearance of a spanwise ordered array of streamwise oriented roll/streak structures (RSS), referred to as Langmuir circulations, that form in the presence of surface wind stress. The coherence and long-range order of the Langmuir circulations are strongly suggestive of an underlying modal instability, and surface wind stress produces the necessary Eulerian shear to provide the required kinetic energy. Unfortunately, there is no instability with RSS form supported solely by Eulerian surface stress-driven shear. However, in the presence of velocity fluctuations in the water column, either in the form of a surface gravity wave velocity field and/or a background field of turbulence, there are two instabilities of the required form. These are the Craik-Leibovich CL2 instability arising from interaction of the Eulerian shear vorticity with the Stokes drift of a surface gravity wave velocity field and the Reynolds stress (RS) torque instability arising from the organization of turbulent Reynolds stresses by a perturbing RSS. The CL2 instability is familiar as an explanation for the RSS of the Langmuir circulation, while the RS torque instability is familiar as an explanation for the RSS in wall-bounded shear flows. In this work, we show that these instabilities act synergistically in the mixed layer of the ocean to form a comprehensive theory for both the formation and equilibration of Langmuir circulations.</description>

      <title>A general kinematic theory of fluid-element rotation and intrinsic vorticity decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study proposes a general kinematic theory for fluid-element rotation and intrinsic vorticity decompositions within the context of vorticity and vortex dynamics. Both the angular velocities of material line and surface elements comprise a classical contribution driven by volume-element rotation (equal to half the local vorticity), and a strain-rate-induced specific angular velocity. Then, two direction-dependent vorticity decompositions (DVDs) are constructed, revealing the rigid rotation and spin modes of vorticity. We derive intrinsic coupling relations for orthogonal line-surface element pair, elucidating their complementary kinematic and geometric roles. Notably, we rigorously prove that the spin mode (in the surface-element-based DVD) is identical to the relative vorticity in the generalized Caswell formula, thereby faithfully accounting for surface shear stress in Newtonian fluids. Next, within a field-theoretic framework, vorticity decompositions are proposed based on streamline and streamsurface using differential geometry. The physical roles of the six rotational invariants in the characteristic algebraic description (including the the normal-nilpotent decomposition (NND) of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) and the resulting invariant vorticity decomposition (IVD)) are clarified through unified analysis with the DVD, Caswell formula, and Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. ... It is found that physical admissible DVD vorticity modes must be bounded by IVD modes in phase space, whereas enforcing a minimization principle naturally yields the Liutex formula. Finally, the effectiveness of theory is validated across diverse flows, from simple to complex. Results show that a coupled IVD-DVD analysis could enhance physical understanding of complex vortical flows under both algebraic and field-theoretic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Inertial migration of slender prolate and thin oblate spheroids in plane Poiseuille flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically examine the inertial migration of a neutrally buoyant spheroid of aspect ratio $\kappa$ in wall-bounded plane Poiseuille flow at small particle Reynolds number ($Re_p$) and small confinement ratio ($\lambda$), with channel Reynolds number $Re_c = Re_p/\lambda^2$ arbitrary. For $\lambda \ll 1$, inertia rapidly drives the spheroid to the tumbling orbit ($C = \infty$), with migration governed by the time-averaged lift over orientations sampled in this orbit. Spheroids with $\kappa = O(1)$ follow Jeffery rotation closely, while deviations for slender rods and thin disks yield equilibrium positions distinct from the classical Segre-Silberberg result. Above a threshold $Re_c$, both rods and disks can undergo rotation arrest near walls, with these arrested regions expanding toward the centerline as $Re_c$ increases. Unlike spheres, the resulting equilibrium positions shift inward with increasing $Re_c$; for disks, these positions themselves become arrested beyond a threshold $Re_c$. The $\kappa$-dependence of equilibrium locations suggests passive shape-sorting strategies in microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Unsteady aerodynamic theory and experiments of hovering membrane wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the unsteady lift response of compliant membrane wings in hovering kinematics by combining analytical inviscid theory with experimental results. An unsteady aerodynamic model is derived for a compliant thin aerofoil immersed in incompressible inviscid flow of variable freestream velocity at high angles of attack. The model, representing a spanwise section of a hovering membrane wing, assumes small membrane deformation and attached flow. These assumptions are supported by experiments showing that passive membrane deformation suppresses flow separation when hovering at angles of attack up to $55^\circ$. An analytically derived expression is obtained for the unsteady lift response, incorporating the classical Wagner and Theodorsen functions and the membrane dynamic response. This theoretical expression is validated against experimental water-tank measurements that are performed on hovering membrane wings at angles of attack of $35^\circ$ and $55^\circ$. Data from membrane deformation measurements is applied to the theoretical lift expression, providing the theoretical lift response prediction for each of the available experimental scenarios. Results of the comparison show that the proposed theory accurately predicts unsteady lift contributions from membrane deformation at high angles of attack, provided the deformation remains small and the flow is attached. This agreement between inviscid theory and experimental measurements suggests that when flow separation is suppressed, the unsteady aerodynamic theory is valid well beyond the typical low angle of attack regime.</description>

      <title>Origin and control of pseudo-rotating spiral jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active flow control (AFC) methods for jet-type flows have been extensively explored since the 1970s. Spectacular examples demonstrating the AFC power and the beauty of fluid mechanics include bifurcating and blooming jets. Recent advances in machine learning-based optimization have enabled efficient exploration of high-dimensional AFC, revealing control solutions beyond human intuition. The present paper focuses on one such discovery: the pseudo-rotating spiral jet. This phenomenon manifests as separate branches disconnected from the main jet stream, formed by vortical structures aligned along curved paths rotating around the initial jet axis. We investigate the origin of these jet-type patterns and formulate new rules for their control, showing that spiral jets belong to a family of multi-armed jets observable only at specific control settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate how human perception of three-dimensional imagery depends on the observable domain and vortex lifetime. Notably, the apparent rotation of spiral arms - despite having a well-defined frequency - is an illusion arising from the tendency to connect neighboring moving objects into continuous patterns. In contrast to the chaotic behavior of small-scale turbulence, we show that large-scale flow motion resulting from AFC operating in a deterministic manner is only seemingly unpredictable. Through theoretical analysis and 3D simulations, we develop a remarkably simple yet precise kinematic model that captures the formation and motion of these vortical paths. This model replicates the outcomes of complex flow simulations, reproduces the apparent jet shape, and facilitates the identification of the actual pattern. The findings offer new perspectives for both academic researchers and industrial engineers.</description>

      <title>Interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann simulation of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of an interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann method (ISLBM) for simulating buoyancy-driven thermal convection on non-uniform meshes. The ISLBM extends the standard lattice Boltzmann framework by incorporating quadratic interpolation during the streaming step, enabling flexible mesh refinement near solid boundaries while maintaining algorithmic simplicity and parallel scalability. The method is implemented for a two-dimensional side-heated cavity at high Rayleigh numbers $10^6 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, and for a three-dimensional side-heated cavity at $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^7$, with the Prandtl number fixed at $Pr=0.71$. Benchmark results show that the ISLBM accurately captures thermal and velocity boundary layers, yielding Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in close agreement with high-fidelity reference data. Grid-convergence studies demonstrate nearly third-order accuracy for global quantities and about second-order for local fields. We further assess the computational performance of the in-house LBM solver against two open-source solvers: Nek5000 based on the spectral element method, and OpenFOAM based on the finite volume method. Performance metrics, including million lattice updates per second (MLUPS) and wall-clock time per dimensionless time unit (WCTpDT), indicate that the ISLBM offers one to three orders of magnitude higher efficiency in large-scale simulations. On GPU architectures, the ISLBM retains high computational performance: throughput on non-uniform meshes reaches 60 -- 70\% of that on uniform meshes in terms of MLUPS, while the cost in WCTpDT is about three times higher. These results highlight the potential of interpolation-based LBM approaches for high-fidelity simulations of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes, providing a robust foundation for future extensions to turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling for flow reconstruction from sparse temperature measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of the velocity field in thermal-hydraulic experiments is of great importance for phenomena interpretation and code validation. Direct measurement employing Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is challenging in some multiphase scenarios where the measurement system would be strongly affected by the phase interaction. In such cases, measurement can only be achieved via sparsely distributed sensors, such as Thermocouples (TCs) and pressure transducers. An example can refer to steam injection into a water pool where the rapid collapse of bubbles and significant temperature gradient make it impossible to obtain the main flow velocity at a large steam flux by PIV. This work investigates the feasibility and capability of utilization of data-driven modeling for flow reconstruction from sparse temperature data. The framework applies (i) a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to encode variables from full space to latent space and (ii) a Fully connected Neural Network (FNN) to approximate sparse measurements to coefficients of latent space. Sensor positioning aiming to identify the optimal sensor location is also discussed. The proposed framework has been tested on a single-phase planar jet and steam condensing jets issued through a multi-hole sparger.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Drag Reduction over Superhydrophobic Surfaces by Unified Parameterizing Structure Spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) have demonstrated significant potential in reducing turbulent drag by introducing slip conditions through micro-structured geometries. While previous studies have examined individual SHS configurations such as post-type, ridge-type, and transverse ridge-type surfaces, a unified analysis that connects these patterns through geometric parameterization remains limited. In this study, we propose a systematic framework to explore the drag reduction characteristics by varying the streamwise and spanwise spacing ($d_1, d_2$) of post-type patterns, effectively encompassing a range of SHS geometries. High-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) were performed using NekRS, a GPU-accelerated spectral element solver, to resolve incompressible turbulent channel flows over these SHSs. To account for variability in the geometric parameters and quantify their influence, we construct a surrogate model based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The resulting model enables efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis, revealing the relative importance of $d_1$ and $d_2$ in drag reduction performance. This unified UQ framework provides both predictive capability and design guidance for optimizing SHS configurations under uncertain geometric conditions.</description>

      <title>Rising bubbles draw surface patterns: a numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small bubbles rising in a chain can self-organize into regular patterns upon reaching a liquid's free surface. This phenomenon is investigated through direct numerical simulations. By varying the bubble release period, distinct branching patterns characterized by different numbers of arms are observed. These macroscopic regular configurations arise from localized non-contact repulsion and pair collisions between bubbles as they arrive at the free-surface emergence site. A theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively relate the number of branches to the bubble release period. The model also predicts probabilities of observing specific arm counts in reality. This study provides insights into broader nonlinear pattern formation and self-organization phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the flow of complex media is relevant for a wide range of research fields and industrial applications. Several numerical approaches exist by which approximate solutions can be determined for the Stokes equations that describe microhydrodynamic flows at the continuum level. However, achieving efficiency and accuracy for an incompressible fluid remains challenging. Here, we present an algorithm for solving the Stokes equations for an Oldroyd-B fluid using Fourier transforms. We gain efficiency by leveraging the 'Fastest Fourier Transform in the West' (FFTW). We validate our approach for the well-characterized four-roll mill, which exhibits nearly singular points of stress at the extensional points of the flow. We capture this divergence and showcase the potential of our method. Future work will concentrate on active systems, the introduction of moving boundaries, and application to microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven droplet deformation at low Weber numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01495v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate droplet deformation following laser-pulse impact at low Weber numbers (We ~ 0.1-100). Droplet dynamics can be characterized by two key parameters: the impact We number and the width, W, of the distribution of the impact force over the droplet surface. By varying laser pulse energy, our experiments traverse a phase space comprising (I) droplet oscillation, (II) breakup, or (III) sheet formation. Numerical simulations complement the experiments by determining the pressure width and by allowing We and W to be varied independently, despite their correlation in the experiments. A single phase diagram, integrating observations from both experiments and simulations, demonstrates that all phenomena can be explained by a single parameter: the deformation Weber number Wed=f(We, W) that is based on the initial radial expansion speed of the droplet, following impact. The resulting phase diagram separates (I) droplet oscillation for Wed&lt;5, from (II) breakup for 5&lt;Wed&lt;60, and (III) sheet formation for Wed&gt;60.</description>

      <title>Wave erosion of ice cliffs: melt rate due to reflection of non-breaking surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave erosion of ice cliffs is one of the main mechanisms for waterline ice melt for icebergs, glacier fronts, and ice-shelf fronts. Despite its importance, this process is fundamentally not well understood or extensively tested in controlled experiments, and therefore coarsely parameterized in geophysical and climate models. In this study, we examine the melting of a vertical ice wall caused by surface waves using both theory and laboratory experiments, with an emphasis on the flow-induced heat transport in the theory and measurements of the melt rate profile under different wave conditions in the experiments. In both the theory and the experiments, we find that there is enhanced melting near the surface that decays with depth. Via an analysis the oscillatory boundary layer flow, we find that an approximate, leading-order, wave-averaged balance of heat transport is given by the vertical advection due to an Eulerian boundary layer streaming current and horizontal diffusion. By solving for this balance and obtaining the wave-averaged temperature field, we find an explicit expression for the wave-induced melt rate. Experimental data show a good match to this expression, especially for larger wave amplitudes and colder water temperatures, though we find that the ambient melt can be a significant contributor to the waterline melt rate.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation for energy-aware hybrid models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work integrates ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) with the energy-aware hybrid modeling approach, applied to a three-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model of the Gulf Stream flow. Building on prior DA success in the QG channel regime, where stochastic corrections based on EOFs were effective, we show that this method fails to address persistent errors in the more complex, dynamically richer Gulf Stream setting.To overcome this, we employ a hybrid model that controls energy at selected scales, maintaining dynamic consistency and physical realism. We evaluate the combined effect of hybrid modeling and DA, using a particle filter which combines model reduction, tempering, jittering, and nudging.
  Numerical experiments show that the hybrid model reproduces both the large-scale jet and small-scale vortices seen in high-resolution reference simulations, but missing in the standard (non-hybrid) QG model. When DA is incorporated, the hybrid model further reduces tracking error and ensemble divergence. Moreover, targeted assimilation from the most energetic region matches tracking error and uncertainty reduction of full-domain networks, highlighting the critical importance of observation network design. These findings demonstrate that combining energy-aware hybrid modeling with ensemble-based DA enables high-fidelity, computationally efficient tracking of the reference solution even under sparse, noisy, localized observations.</description>

Abstract: The new type of instability of the flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a channel with imposed wall-normal magnetic field is studied using linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations. The instability is triggered by the inflection points that develop in the base velocity profile when the electric conductivity of the fluid varies across the channel.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Modeling of Droplet Impact Dynamics on Micro-Structured Surfaces: Nonlocal Theory and SPH Simulation of Pancake Bouncing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate mathematical modeling of droplet impact dynamics on micro-structured surfaces is fundamental to understanding and predicting complex fluid behaviors relevant to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically studied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic micro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges. Central to these challenges is the need to construct rigorous mathematical models that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures on droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for surface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between fluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical framework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic micro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to represent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical derivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface tension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter tuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental difficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To overcome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs fluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber number conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D simulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data, confirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of numerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.</description>

      <title>Viscous adhesion in vibrated sheets: elastohydrodynamics with inertia and compressibility effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments demonstrating that vibrating elastic sheets can function as seemingly contactless suction cups, we investigate the elastohydrodynamic hovering of a thin elastic sheet vibrating near a rigid substrate. Previous theoretical work suggests that the hovering height results from a balance between the active forcing that triggers the vibrations, the bending forces associated with the sheet's deformation, the viscous lubrication flow between the sheet and the substrate, and the sheet's weight. Here, we extend this analysis beyond the asymptotic regime of weak forcing and explore the regime of strong forcing through numerical simulations. We further quantify the influence of fluid inertia and compressibility on the equilibrium hovering height and the maximum load that can be supported. Both effects are found to introduce repulsive contributions to the net force on the sheet, which can significantly reduce its adhesive strength. Beyond providing insights into soft contactless grippers and swimming near surfaces, our analysis is relevant to the elastohydrodynamics of squeeze films and near-field acoustic levitation.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional numerical model for system performance prediction of loop heat pipes and its validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing high power density electronics requires effective and highly reliable cooling techniques with low thermal resistance and high heat removal capacity. Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are one kind of two-phase heat transfer device which can meet all these requirements. A physics-based one-dimensional numerical model has been elaborated to further develop this promising electronics cooling solution. In addition, an experimental setup using water as coolant, and which includes an LHP built with transparent materials, is used to validate the numerical model. This validation is obtained by comparing the numerical results with the temperature measurements, the two-phase flow section length in the condenser line, and an energy balance evaluation. The numerical model is then used to predict the system performance of the LHP under investigation. The results indicate that this LHP can only work in fixed conductance mode for the given operating conditions. Further, the influence of the charging mass is assessed. For low charging masses, both the natural convection cooled condenser and the compensation chamber casing can be fully utilized to dissipate the input heat, which can exceed {29.9 W} when the coolant saturation temperature is at {100 \celsius}. The operational limits for LHPs are investigated. For the current LHP under given operating conditions, the heat dissipation limit restricts the maximum input heat power, which in turn induces the activation of the heat leakage limit and the liquid-filling limit. It is shown that the condenser with higher heat dissipation capacity and lower thermal resistance will therefore enlarge the operational envelope.</description>

      <title>Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in binary fluids with miscibility gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isothermal spatio-temporal evolution of an interface between binary fluids, with temperature sensitive miscibility gap, subjected to shear flow is investigated using direct numerical simulations. The thermophysical properties and the interfacial tension in such fluids exhibit a dynamic temperature dependence based on the degree of miscibility. These fluid pairs can therefore be deployed in crucial microfluidic applications involving enhancement of liquid-liquid mass transfer. In this study, a modified phase-field approach that allows modeling of partially miscible fluids and continuous transition from an initially immiscible state to a completely miscible state is employed to investigate the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The analysis entails two different configurations based on the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system. In the first configuration, the fluid pair is considered in equilibrium at different degrees of partially miscibility. The second configuration deals with fluids out of equilibrium thereby allowing simultaneous mass transport across the interface. The results reveal the effect of apparent surface tension in miscible fluids, shear flow profile, the degree of stratification and the effect of mass diffusion across the interface. The shear instability in a fluid pair close to the consolute point is found to be independent of the extent of stratification. Finally, the competition between the time scales of the instability and the diffusion process reveals the importance of the surface tension of binary fluids in the immiscible limit.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Invariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust optimisation framework for computing invariant solutions of wall-bounded flows by recasting the Navier-Stokes equations as a variational problem as established in Ashtari and Schneider, JFM (2023). The approach minimises the residual of the governing equations over a finite time horizon, seeking periodic or equilibrium solutions. A novel contribution is made by including a Galerkin projection onto a basis of divergence-free modes that satisfy the no-slip boundary conditions. This projection not only makes the variational framework applicable to wall-bounded flows but it also yields a low-order representation of the dynamics. The basis is derived from resolvent analysis, which provides an orthonormal set. We demonstrate the method on a 2D3C formulation of rotating plane Couette flow, obtaining exact equilibrium and periodic solutions consistent with direct numerical simulations. The conditioning of the optimisation problem is analysed in detail, showing that convergence rates depend on the stability properties of the targeted solutions. Finally, we highlight a direct link between the conditioning of the optimisation and the structure of the resolvent operator, suggesting a unifying perspective on both the efficiency of the optimisation and the dynamical significance of resolvent modes.</description>

      <title>Time-varying sensitivity analysis for mixing in chaotic flows: a comparison study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered injection and extraction systems that create chaotic advection are promising procedures for enhancing mixing between two species. Mixing efficiencies vary considerably, so carefully selecting the design parameters, like pumping rates, well locations, or operation times, is crucial. While numerous studies investigate the conditions required to achieve chaotic flow, sensitivity analyses addressing its impact on mixing have rarely been performed. However, selecting a suitable sensitivity analysis method depends on the underlying system and is often restricted by the computational cost, especially when considering complex, high-dimensional models. Moreover, the most appropriate metric to quantify mixing (e.g., plume area, peak concentration) can also be system-specific. We perform a time-varying sensitivity analysis on the mixing enhancement of two chaotic flow fields with different complexities. The rotated potential mixing (RPM) flow is parametrized using two or four hyperparameters, while the quadrupole flow utilizes 16 hyperparameters. We compare three global sensitivity analysis methods: Sobol indices, Morris scores, and a modification of the activity scores. We evaluate the temporal evolution of the sensitivity of the design parameters, compare the performance of the three methods, and highlight their potential in analyzing parameter interactions. The analysis of the RPM flow shows comparable sensitivities for all methods. Additionally, our numerical experiments show that Morris is the cheapest method, needing at most four times fewer model evaluations than Sobol to reach convergence. This motivates us to only use the computationally cheaper but as reliable Morris and activity scores on the 16-dimensional model, yielding again consistent results.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Two-Phase Flows: A Projection-Based Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes (CH-NS) equations provide a powerful framework for modeling multiphase flows with diffuse interfaces, enabling simulations of droplet breakup, bubble dynamics, and hydrodynamic instabilities. These capabilities are vital in boiling heat transfer, microfluidics, coating, additive manufacturing, and oil-water separation, where resolving fluid-fluid interactions is essential. Numerically, the CH-NS system is challenging: the Cahn-Hilliard equation involves higher-order derivatives and nonlinearities, and coupling with Navier-Stokes introduces strong two-way interactions. The velocity field advects the phase field, while the evolving interface alters density and viscosity, feeding back into the flow. Variable-density and variable-viscosity systems further increase complexity, requiring accurate treatment of property contrasts without losing stability or mass conservation. To address this, we employ a decoupled pressure-projection method with finite differences on staggered grids and explicit Euler time stepping. Our formulation extends the CH-NS system to homogeneous and variable-property fluids with consistent hydrodynamic-phase-field coupling. Validation against canonical benchmarks-including bubble rise and Plateau-Taylor instability shows excellent agreement in rise velocity, interface shape, and instability wavelength. This framework establishes a reproducible foundation for multiphysics extensions such as heat transfer, phase change, and electrohydrodynamics in boiling, droplet manipulation, and electronics cooling</description>

      <title>Equivariant U-Shaped Neural Operators for the Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01293v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries. Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics, achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of vortical interactions and their implications for mitigating thermoacoustic instability in a turbulent combustor. The regions of intense vortical interactions are identified as vortical communities in the network space of weighted directed vortical networks constructed from two-dimensional experimental velocity data. One can expect vortical interactions in the combustor to be strongest near the moment of vortex shedding, as the shed vortices gradually weaken due to dissipation while convecting downstream. However, we show that, during the state of thermoacoustic instability, there is a non-trivial consistent phase lag of approximately 52 degrees between the shedding of the coherent structures from the backward-facing step and the time instant when the vortical interactions attain their local maximum value. We explain this phase lag by investigating the correlation between acoustic pressure fluctuations, spatio-temporal dynamics of coherent structures, and vortical interactions in the reaction field of the combustor. We also show the aperiodic variation of vortical interactions during the states of combustion noise and aperiodic epochs of intermittency. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal evolution of pairs of vortical communities with the maximum inter-community interactions provides insight into explaining the critical regions detected in the reaction field during the states of intermittency and thermoacoustic instability, also identified in previous studies. We further show that the most efficient suppression of thermoacoustic instability via air microjet injection is achieved when steady air jets are introduced to disrupt the maximum inter-community interactions present during the state of thermoacoustic instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar regions are covered by sea ice, which can be seen as a thin solid elastic sheet with heterogeneous mechanical properties. The dynamics of deformation of a floating solid sheet are primarly governed by gravity, water density, and the flexural modulus, which depends on its mechanical properties, namely the thickness, the Young's Modulus and the Poisson ratio. Non-invasive methods from seismology can retrieve these three parameters from sheet deformation dynamics. In this article, we developed another method to extract locally the flexural modulus of a floating thin elastic sheet from the spatio-temporal deformations of the sheet. We perform laboratory experiment to test the accuracy and the robustness of this method on silicon membranes of controlled mechanical properties. Using patches of different thicknesses and shapes, we eventually draw maps of sheet thickness, with a sub-wavelength spatial resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The water entry at high horizontal speed of double-curvature specimens, reproducing the rear part of the fuselage that first gets in contact with the water during aircraft ditching, is investigated experimentally. Three shapes are analysed, representing different aircraft types. Pressure and load measurements are taken, supported by underwater high-speed visualization. The effects of different horizontal speeds, pitch angles, and curvatures are analysed, while keeping a constant vertical-to-horizontal velocity ratio. It is observed that the longitudinal curvature plays a significant role in the hydrodynamics, potentially leading to cavitation and ventilation in the rear part of the specimen at high speeds. The transverse curvature affects the pressures and loads both at the front and at the rear, since a lower transverse curvature increases the possibility of the fluid to escape from the sides. An increase in pitch angle results in an increased loading, in terms of both amplitude and distribution. Finally, an increased horizontal speed leads to higher loads at the front but also affects the cavitation and ventilation modalities at the rear. The load scaling for flat plates also applies to these specimens at the front, but the occurrence of cavitation and ventilation invalidates it at the rear. The time evolution of the cavitation region and of the wetted area are examined through advanced image processing techniques and pressure data analysis. The comparison with the geometric intersection area of the specimen with the still water surface provides further insight into the hydrodynamic phenomena during the water entry.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the coupled deformation and flow behavior of thin, hyper-elastic, porous membranes subjected to pressure loading. Using bulge test experiments, optical deformation measurements, and flow rate characterization, we analyze the structural and fluid dynamic responses of membranes with varying material stiffness and porosity patterns. A two-parameter Gent model accurately captures the hyper-elastic deformation, and local stretch analysis reveals non-uniform stretch distributions across the membrane. We find that membrane deformation is primarily governed by material stiffness and pressure, independent of porosity. Pore diameter scales linearly with local stretch, leading to a radial gradient of increasing pore size toward the membrane center. Flow rate scaling is characterized using a discharge coefficient, which accounts for both pore area expansion and pressure losses. Together, these results establish a unified framework that links structural deformation and flow performance in flexible porous membranes, providing robust scaling laws for the design of adaptive, bio-inspired flow-regulating systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate inertially forced isothermal quantum turbulence (coflow of normal and superfluid components) at temperatures of 1.6 and 2 K. The experiments are carried out in a large optical cryostat, where quasi-isotropic, homogeneous turbulence is generated using a double oscillating grid. Turbulence intensity is tuned by varying the grid stroke and frequency. The flow is probed via 2D and 3D reconstructions of quasi-isodense microsphere trajectories, from which we extract the large-scale properties of the flow in the fully turbulent regime for different Reynolds numbers: the turbulent velocity fluctuations, the energy transfer rate, and the integral length scale. Additionally, we determine the mean vortex line density $\mathcal{L}$ via attenuation of a second sound standing wave across the entire measurement volume. Our results confirm with an improved accuracy that the intervortex spacing $\ell =1/\sqrt{\mathcal{L}}$ scales with the Reynolds number $\text{Re}_\kappa$ (based on the quantum of circulation $\kappa$) as $\ell\propto \text{Re}_\kappa^{-3/4}$, with a well-defined numerical prefactor and no observed temperature dependence. This scaling recalls that of the dissipative length scale in classical Kolmogorov (K41) turbulence and it lead previous authors to interpret $\ell$ as an effective dissipation length scale. However, in our temperature range, this interpretation is not consistent with the apparent temperature independence of the prefactor. Based on those arguments, we propose an alternative interpretation that suggests that the inter-vortex distance in coflow turbulence is the consequence of the quantum restricted depth of the superfluid component energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic characterization of turbulence intermittency</title>

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic characterization of small-scale intermittency in turbulent flows, that distinguishes turbulence-induced intermittency from purely kinematic effects. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to quantify the deviation of pseudodissipation, dissipation or enstrophy of a turbulent flow field from that of a Gaussian random velocity field, serving as a comprehensive measure of the small-scale intermittency arising from turbulence dynamics. Shannon entropy is employed to evaluate the uncertainty of these small-scale quantities. Analysis of direct numerical simulation data of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow across a wide range of Taylor Reynolds numbers demonstrates the existence of two critical Reynolds numbers where the variation of uncertainty changes. The study reveals a new scaling behavior and presence of a symmetry: (i) turbulence-induced intermittency grows logarithmically with Reynolds number unlike the commonly reported power-law scaling and (ii) turbulence dynamics produce equal intermittency in both dissipation rate and enstrophy, in contrast to the prevailing assumptions of asymmetry in strain-rate and vorticity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Solid-Fluid Interaction Scheme in Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22256v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudopotential model within the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) framework has emerged as a prominent approach in computational fluid dynamics due to its dual strengths in physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, when modeling wettability phenomenon, existing solid-fluid interaction schemes exhibit persistent challenges in multi-component immiscible fluid systems, notably manifested through spurious velocity artifacts and unphysical mass-transfer boundary layers. This study presents an improved interaction scheme that preserves implementation simplicity while effectively mitigating these numerical artifacts. Furthermore, leveraging the enhanced isotropy characteristics of eighth-order discrete schemes, we develop a novel boundary treatment methodology addressing second-layer lattice data reconstruction at complex interfaces. To verify the universality of the proposed optimization scheme, four benchmark scenarios, including static contact angle measurement on cylindrical surface, droplet dynamics through confined geometries, immiscible displacement processes, and co-current flow in microchannels, are simulated to demonstrate the proposed scheme's capability. The results show that the improved scheme can well simulate various complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Wall boundary conditions for Lattice Boltzmann simulations of turbulent flows with wall functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates wall boundary condition schemes for the simulation of turbulent flows using the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) coupled to turbulence models with wall functions. The analysis focuses on two schemes: a regularized boundary scheme with third-order reconstruction of the velocity gradients using wall function data and a slip-velocity bounce-back scheme. The LBM solver is coupled to the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model and uses a model consistent wall function. The performance of the wall boundary schemes is assessed in two canonical turbulent flow cases, a fully developed channel flow and a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate boundary layer (BL), selected specifically to isolate and analyze the impact of wall boundary treatments on turbulence modeling. The analysis shows that, for the selected test cases, the slip-velocity bounce-back approach, which has received relatively little attention within the context of LBM coupled to Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models with wall functions, behaves fairly consistently in terms of both accuracy and mesh convergence. The regularized-based approach, on the other hand, appears to be highly sensitive to the reconstruction of the wall-normal velocity gradient, even in simple geometries such as flat walls where no interpolation is required. This dependency of the regularized boundary schemes on near-wall gradients, which had been noted before in the literature, requires the use of ad-hoc gradient reconstruction techniques, requirements that are not present in the slip-velocity bounce-back method. A hybrid regularized boundary scheme that blends two different gradient reconstruction techniques but requires calibration is introduced as a tool to investigate this effect.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-analysis-inspired boundary conditions aiming at eliminating polymer diffusive instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of polymer diffusive instability (PDI) by Beneitez et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2023, 8: L101901) poses challenges in implementing artificial conformation diffusion (ACD) in transition simulations of viscoelastic wall-shear flows. In this paper, we demonstrate that the unstable PDI is primarily induced by the conformation boundary conditions additionally introduced in the ACD equation system, which could be eliminated if a new set of conformation conditions is adopted. To address this issue, we begin with an asymptotic analysis of the PDI within the near-wall thin diffusive layer, which simplifies the complexity of the instability system by reducing the number of the controlling parameters from five to zero. Then, based on this simplified model, we construct a stable asymptotic solution that minimises the perturbations in the wall sublayer. From the near-wall behaviour of this solution, we derive a new set of conformation boundary conditions, prescribing a Neumann-type condition for its streamwise stretching component, $c_{11}$, and Dirichlet-type conditions for all the other conformation components. These boundary conditions are subsequently validated within the original ACD instability system, incorporating both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P constitutive models. Finally, we perform direct numerical simulations based on the traditional and the new conformation conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the latter in eliminating the unstable PDI. Importantly, this improvement does not affect the calculations of other types of instabilities. Therefore, this work offers a promising approach for achieving reliable polymer-flow simulations with ACD, ensuring both numerical stability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improved Analytical Solution for Turbulent Flow in Channel and Circular Pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approximate analytical solution for turbulent flow in a channel was proposed in Fedoseyev (2023). It described the mean turbulent flow velocity as a superposition of parabolic (laminar) and superexponential (turbulent) solutions. The Alexeev Hydrodynamic Equations (AHE), proposed by Alexeev (1994), were used as the governing equations to describe turbulent flow. Compared to the Navier-Stokes equations, the AHE include additional terms representing temporal and spatial fluctuations. These additional terms include a timescale multiplier $\tau$, and the AHE reduce to the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit as $\tau \to 0$
  In this study, we propose an improved analytical solution formula that provides better agreement with experimental data at high Reynolds numbers. The maximum discrepancy between the analytical solution and experimental data has been reduced from 5% to 2% for Reynolds numbers of order 100,000, and from 10% to 4% for Reynolds numbers up to 35,000,000, based on comparisons with experimental results ranging from the legacy work of Nikuradse (Prandtl group, 1932) to studies by Wei (1989), Zagarola (1996), van Doorne (2007), and the recent work of Pasch (2023).</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion in axially strained tube flows: Large-time asymptotics and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion of a passive scalar in an axially strained flow in a slender tube is studied, with particular focus on large-time asymptotics following the approach of~\cite{rajamanickam2020dispersion}. For times exceeding the cross-sectional diffusion timescale, the scalar field forms an axial (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck) Gaussian profile whose variance increases exponentially with the local axial strain, which itself varies with radial location, while radial diffusion only slowly modulates the overall amplitude. In other words, the scalar is dominated by strong axial stretching, completely overwhelming radial diffusion. In striking contrast to classical Taylor dispersion, where radial diffusion rapidly homogenizes the profile and axial convection appears only as a small correction, here axial stretching governs the dominant dynamics, producing a fundamentally different transport mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <title>Role of Friction on the Formation of Confined Granular Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unstable systems of fluidized grains in a very-narrow vertical tube can auto-defluidize after some time, the settling particles forming either a glass- or crystal-like structure. We carried out experiments using different polymer spheres, of known friction and roughness, fluidized in water. A diagram was obtained for the \RefereeA{shell-settled} particles when the coefficient of friction is of the order of 0.1, and their structure is characterized through an analysis of the nearest neighbors' angles. We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material, and that, once defluidized, the decrease in the coefficient of sliding friction leads to more organized (crystal-like) structures, while those with higher friction coefficients are amorphous (glass-like structures). Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties.</description>

      <title>Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Aware Ensemble SINDy for Interpretable Symbolic SGS Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work designs a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), the approach addresses key limitations through four enhancements. First, symbolic parameterisation enables physical parameters to vary within unified regression. Second, the Dimensional Similarity Filter enforces unit consistency while reducing candidate libraries. Third, memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enables batch processing of large datasets. Fourth, ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis ensures robust model identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates consistent discovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered Burgers datasets, the framework autonomously discovers the SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} = 0.1604\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$ with the SINDy-discovered Smagorinsky constant $C_s^{\text{SINDy}} \approx 0.4005$ without predefined closure assumptions, recovering Smagorinsky-type structure directly from data.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.885$ across filter scales and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical SGS closures. The ability of the framework to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling methods, contributing to the broader field of data-driven turbulence closure discovery.</description>
