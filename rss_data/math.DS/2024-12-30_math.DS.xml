      <title>Twist like behavior in non-twist patterns of triods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sufficient condition for a \emph{pattern} $\pi$ on a \emph{triod} $T$ to have \emph{rotation number} $\rho_{\pi}$ coincide with an end-point of its \emph{forced rotation interval} $I_{\pi}$. Then, we demonstrate the existence of peculiar \emph{patterns} on \emph{triods} that are neither \emph{triod twists} nor possess a \emph{block structure} over a \emph{triod twist pattern}, but their \emph{rotation numbers} are an end point of their respective \emph{forced rotation intervals}, mimicking the behavior of \emph{triod twist patterns}. These \emph{patterns}, absent in circle maps (see \cite{almBB}), highlight a key difference between the rotation theories for \emph{triods} (introduced in \cite{BMR}) and that of circle maps. We name these \emph{patterns}: ``\emph{strangely ordered}" and show that they are semi-conjugate to circle rotations via a piece-wise monotone map. We conclude by providing an algorithm to construct unimodal \emph{strangely ordered patterns} with arbitrary \emph{rotation pairs}.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the high-dimensional Kuramoto model on Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the convergence properties of a heterogeneous consensus model on Stiefel manifolds. We consider each agent, without interaction, moving according to the flow determined by the fundamental vector field of the right multiplication action of the orthogonal group on the Stiefel manifold. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of N such agents, assuming that, as a result of their interactions, each agent's velocity is the sum of its natural velocity and an additional velocity directed towards the average position of the N agents. If the fundamental vector fields of all agents are the same, their movement can be represented as a gradient flow on a product manifold. In this study, we specifically investigate the asymptotic behavior in a non-gradient flow setting, where the fundamental vector fields are not all the same. Since fewer tools are available to address non-gradient flows, we perform an orbital stability analysis to obtain the desired results instead of relying on a gradient flow structure. Our estimate improves upon the previous result in [Ha et al., Automatica 136 (2022)]. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of the asymptotic dynamics, we derive uniform-in-time stability with respect to the initial data.</description>

      <title>New Theorem on Chaos Transitions in Second-Order Dynamical Systems with Tikhonov Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines second-order dynamical systems incorporating Tikhonov regularization. It focuses on how nonlinearities induce bifurcations and chaotic dynamics. By using Lyapunov functions, bifurcation theory, and numerical simulations, we identify critical transitions that lead to complex behaviors like strange attractors and chaos. The findings provide a theoretical framework for applications in optimization, machine learning, and biological modeling. Key contributions include stability conditions, characterization of chaotic regimes, and methods for managing nonlinear instabilities in interdisciplinary systems.</description>

      <title>Entropy Continuity of Lyapunov Exponents for Non-flat 1-dimensional Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the continuity property of Lyapunov exponents proved in \cite{BCS-Exponents} for smooth surface diffeomorphisms extends to smooth interval maps, in the case when the map only has non-flat critical points and the entropies converging to the topological entropy. The result we obtained is stronger than the continuity of Lyapunov exponents. In particular, we prove the uniform integrability of Lyapunov exponents over entropies.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Bifurcation for Periodic Solutions of Hamiltonian Systems via Comparison Theory for the Spectral Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain local and global bifurcation for periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems by using a new way to apply a comparison principle of the spectral flow that was originally introduced by Pejsachowicz in a joint work with the third author. A particular novelty is the study of global bifurcation, which to the best of our knowledge has not been done via the spectral flow.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic reduction of contact dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal algorithm to derive a macroscopic dynamics from the microscopic dynamical system via the averaging process and symplecto-contact reduction was introduced by Jin-wook Lim and the second-named author in [LO23]. They apply the algorithm to derive non-equilibrium thermodynamics from the statistical mechanics utilizing the relative information entropy as a generating function of the associated thermodynamic equilibrium. In the present paper, we apply this algorithm to the contact Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We describe a procedure of obtaining a discrete set of dynamical invariants of the given contact Hamiltonian system, or more generally of a contact multi-Hamiltonian system in a canonical way by deriving a (finite-dimensional non-equilibrium) thermodynamic system. We call this reduction the thermodynamic reduction of contact dynamics.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of polynomial maps and multipliers at small cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix an integer $d \geq 2$. The space $\mathcal{P}_{d}$ of polynomial maps of degree $d$ modulo conjugation by affine transformations is naturally an affine variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ of dimension $d -1$. For each integer $P \geq 1$, the elementary symmetric functions of the multipliers at all the cycles with period $p \in \lbrace 1, \dotsc, P \rbrace$ induce a natural morphism $\operatorname{Mult}_{d}^{(P)}$ defined on $\mathcal{P}_{d}$. In this article, we show that the morphism $\operatorname{Mult}_{d}^{(2)}$ induced by the multipliers at the cycles with periods $1$ and $2$ is both finite and birational onto its image. In the case of polynomial maps, this strengthens results by McMullen and by Ji and Xie stating that $\operatorname{Mult}_{d}^{(P)}$ is quasifinite and birational onto its image for all sufficiently large integers $P$. Our result arises as the combination of the following two statements: $\mathord{\bullet}$ A sequence of polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ of degree $d$ with bounded multipliers at its cycles with periods $1$ and $2$ is necessarily bounded in $\mathcal{P}_{d}(\mathbb{C})$. $\mathord{\bullet}$ A generic conjugacy class of polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ of degree $d$ is uniquely determined by its multipliers at its cycles with periods $1$ and $2$.</description>

      <title>Explicit propagation reversal bounds for bistable differential equations on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide explicit description of the pinning region and propagation reversal phenomenon for the bistable reaction diffusion equation on regular biinfinite trees. In contrast to the general existence results for smooth bistabilities, the closed-form formulas are enabled by the choice of the piecewise linear McKean's caricature. We construct exact pinned waves and show their stability. The results are qualitatively similar to the propagation reversal results for smooth bistabilities. Major exception consists in the unboundedness of the pinning region in the case of the bistable McKean's caricature. Consequently, the propagation reversal also occurs for arbitrarily large diffusion.</description>

      <title>Compactifications and measures for rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extensions of the measure of maximal entropy to suitable compactifications of the parameter space and the moduli space of rational maps acting on the Riemann sphere. For parameter space, we consider a space which resolves the discontinuity of the iterate map. We show that the measure of maximal entropy extends continuously to this resolution space. For moduli space, we consider a space which resolves the discontinuity of the iterate map acting on its geometric invariant theory compactification. We show that the measure of maximal entropy, barycentered and modulo rotations, also extends continuously to this resolution space. Thus, answering in the positive a question raised by DeMarco. A main ingredient is a description of limiting dynamics for some sequences.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and engineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical system may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the dataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus my confined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically inter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries sampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even indistinguishable. So there is no unqiue source for the timeseries. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical framework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences. We introduce two categories of observed dynamical systems and timeseries-data. These are related to the well known category of dynamical systems via functors. This enables a functorial interpretation of the task of reconstruction as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several generalizations of Vershik-Kerov limit shape problem are motivated by topological string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. In this paper specifically we study the circular and linear quiver theories. We also briefly discuss the double-elliptic generalization of the Vershik-Kerov problem, related to six dimensional gauge theory compactified on a torus, and to elliptic cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of points on a plane. We prove that the limit shape in that setting is governed by a genus two algebraic curve, suggesting unexpected dualities between the enumerative and equivariant parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for a class of linear transport-dominated systems via the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving optimal control problems for transport-dominated partial differential equations (PDEs) can become computationally expensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional systems. To overcome this challenge, we focus on developing and deriving reduced-order models that can replace the full PDE system in solving the optimal control problem. Specifically, we explore the use of the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as a reduced-order model, which is particularly effective for capturing high-fidelity, low-dimensional representations of transport-dominated phenomena. Furthermore, we propose two distinct frameworks for addressing these problems: one where the reduced-order model is constructed first, followed by optimization of the reduced system, and another where the original PDE system is optimized first, with the reduced-order model subsequently applied to the optimality system. We consider a 1D linear advection equation problem and compare the computational performance of the shifted POD method against the conventional methods like the standard POD when the reduced-order models are used as surrogates within a backtracking line search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of state-dependent and state-independent sweeping processes driven by prox-regular sets and perturbed by a history-dependent operator. Our approach, based on an enhanced version of Gronwall's lemma and fixed-point arguments, provides an efficient framework for analyzing sweeping processes. In particular, our findings recover all existing results for the class of Volterra sweeping processes and provide new insights into history-dependent sweeping processes. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to establish the well-posedness of a viscoelastic model with long memory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive variational integrators for stochastic Hamiltonian systems on Lie groups using a discrete version of the stochastic Hamiltonian phase space principle. The structure-preserving properties of the resulting scheme, such as symplecticity, preservation of the Lie-Poisson structure, preservation of the coadjoint orbits, and conservation of Casimir functions, are discussed, along with a discrete Noether theorem for subgroup symmetries. We also consider in detail the case of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with advected quantities, studying the associated structure-preserving properties in relation to semidirect product Lie groups. A full convergence proof for the scheme is provided for the case of the Lie group of rotations. Several numerical examples are presented, including simulations of the free rigid body and the heavy top.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the issue of uniform measure attractors for non-autonomous McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations defined on unbounded thin domains. Initially, the concept of uniform measure attractors is recalled, and thereafter, the existence and uniqueness of such attractors are demonstrated. Uniform tail estimates are employed to establish the asymptotic compactness of the processes, thereby overcoming the non-compactness issue inherent in the usual Sobolev embedding on unbounded thin domains. Finally, we demonstrate that the upper semi-continuity of uniform measure attractors defined on $(n + 1)$-dimensional unbounded thin domains collapsing into the space $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Potential Vector Fields in $\mathbb R^3$ and $\alpha$-Meridional Mappings of the Second Kind $(\alpha \in \mathbb R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends approach developed in a recent author's paper on analytic models of potential fields in inhomogeneous media. New three-dimensional analytic models of potential vector fields in some layered media are constructed. Properties of various analytic models in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates in $\mathbb R^3$ are compared. The original properties of the Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}(\vec V)$ of potential meridional fields $\vec V$ in cylindrically layered media, where $\phi( \rho) = \rho^{-\alpha}$ $(\alpha \in \mathbb R)$, lead to the concept of \emph{$\alpha$-meridional mappings of the first and second kind}. The concept of \emph{$\alpha$-Meridional functions of the first and second kind} naturally arises in this way. When $\alpha =1$, the special concept of \emph{Radially holomorphic functions in $\mathbb R^3$}, introduced by G\"{u}rlebeck, Habetha and Spr\"{o}ssig in 2008, is developed in more detail. Certain key properties of the radially holomorphic functions $G$ and functions reversed with respect to $G$ are first characterized. Surprising properties of the radially holomorphic potentials represented by superposition of the radially holomorphic exponential function $e^{\breve{\beta} x}$ $(\breve{\beta} \in \mathbb R)$ and function reversed with respect to $e^{\breve{\beta} x}$ are demonstrated explicitly. The basic properties of the radially holomorphic potential represented by the radially holomorphic extension of the Joukowski transformation in $\mathbb R^3$ are studied.</description>

      <title>Separating measurable recurrence from strong recurrence via rigidity sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.05609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is an abelian group, we say $S\subset G$ is a set of recurrence if for every probability measure preserving $G$-system $(X,\mu,T)$ and every $D\subset X$ having $\mu(D)&gt;0$, there is a $g\in S$ such that $\mu(D\cap T^{g}D)&gt;0$. We say $S$ is a set of strong recurrence if for every set $D$ having $\mu(D)&gt;0$ there is a $c&gt;0$ such that $\mu(D\cap T^{g}D)&gt;c$ for infinitely many $g\in S$. We call $S$ measure expanding if for all $g\in G$, the translate $S+g$ is a set of recurrence. A rigidity sequence for $(X,\mu,T)$ is a sequence of elements $s_n\in G$ satisfying $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mu(D\triangle T^{s_n}D)=0$ for all measurable $D\subset X$.
  For all but countably many countable abelian groups $G$, we prove that if $S$ is measure expanding, there is a sequence of elements $s_n\in S$ such that $\{s_n:n\in \mathbb N\}$ is also measure expanding and every translate of $(s_n)$ is a rigidity sequence for some free weak mixing measure preserving $G$-system. The special case where $S=G$ proves a conjecture of Ackelsberg.
  As a consequence, we prove that for every countably infinite abelian group $G$ and every measure expanding set $S\subset G$ there is a subset $S'\subset S$ such that $S'$ is measure expanding and no translate of $S'$ is a set of strong recurrence.</description>

      <title>Separating topological recurrence from measurable recurrence: exposition and extension of Kriz's example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every infinite set $E\subset \mathbb Z$, there is a set $S\subset E-E$ which is a set of topological recurrence and not a set of measurable recurrence. This extends a result of Igor Kriz, proving that there is a set of topological recurrence which is not a set of measurable recurrence. Our construction follows Kriz's closely, and this paper can be considered an exposition of the original argument.</description>

      <title>On variational principle for upper metric mean dimension with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Borrowing the idea of topological pressure determining measure-theoretical entropy in topological dynamical systems, we establish a variational principle for upper metric mean dimension with potential in terms of upper measure-theoretical metric mean dimension of invariant measures. Moreover, the notion of equilibrium state is introduced to characterize these measures that attain the supremum of the variational principle.</description>

      <title>Cocycles with Quasi-Conformality I: Stability and abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers devoted to the study of linear cocycles over chaotic systems. In the present paper, we establish the existence of such cocycles that $\mathcal{C}^\alpha$-stably exhibit fiberwise bounded orbits ($\alpha&gt;0$). The proof is based on a new mechanism which yields stable elliptic-type behavior in $\mathrm{GL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ or $\mathrm{SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ cocycles. Moreover, we show that this phenomenon is $\mathcal{C}^0$-dense among $\mathrm{SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ cocycles over a shift of finite type without dominated splitting.</description>

      <title>Regional Control Strategies for a Spatiotemporal SQEIAR Epidemic Model: Application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a spatial SEIAR-type epidemic model considering a quarantined population (denoted as Q), which we call the SQEIAR model. The dynamics of the SQEIAR model are described by six Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that represent the changes in the susceptible, quarantined, exposed, asymptomatic, infected, and recovered populations. Our goal is to reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and infected individuals while accounting for the environment, which plays a critical role in the spread of epidemics. We then propose a novel strategy for epidemic control, incorporating two key control measures: regional quarantine for the susceptible population and treatment for the infected. This approach serves as an alternative to widespread quarantine, minimizing the economic, social, and other potential impacts. Additionally, we consider the possibility of reinfection among recovered individuals, a common occurrence in many diseases. To demonstrate the practical utility of our results, a numerical example centered on COVID-19 is presented.</description>

      <title>On linear response for discontinuous perturbations of smooth endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider discontinuous perturbations of smooth endomorphisms and show that if the perturbed family satisfies uniform mixing assumptions on standard pairs the physical measure is Lipschitz in the parameter defying the perturbation. We also study the problem of linear response for this class of perturbations. Finally we discuss the applicability of the abstract assumptions proving linear response for a concrete example.</description>

      <title>Which subsets and when orbits of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems prefer to visit: operator renewal theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses some basic questions in the theory of finite time dynamics and finite time predictions for non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. It is concerned with transport in phase spaces of such systems, and analyzes which subsets and when the orbits prefer to visit. An asymptotic expansion of the decay of polynomial escape rates is obtained, which also allows finding asymptotics of the first hitting probabilities. Our approach is based on the construction of operator renewal equations for open dynamical systems and on their spectral analysis. In order to do this, we generalize the Keller-Liverani perturbation technique. Applications to a large class of one-dimensional non-uniformly expanding systems are considered.</description>

      <title>A characterization of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes via tropical cluster transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.05214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a characterization of generic pseudo-Anosov mapping classes purely in terms of their expressions in the shear coordinates, thus giving an answer to a problem raised by Papadopoulos--Penner [PP93]. This characterization has a cluster algebraic generalization called the sign stability introduced in [IK21]. By combining with the results in [IK21], we see that the algebraic entropies of the cluster $\mathcal{A}$- and $\mathcal{X}$-transformations induced by a generic pseudo-Anosov mapping class both coincide with its topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Deautonomisation by singularity confinement and degree growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an explanation of a number of observations relating to degree growth of birational mappings of the plane and their deautonomisation by singularity confinement. These observations are of a link between two a priori unrelated notions: firstly the dynamical degree of the mapping and secondly the evolution of parameters required for its singularity structure to remain unchanged under a sufficiently general deautonomisation. We explain this correspondence for a large class of birational mappings of the plane via the spaces of initial conditions for their deautonomised versions. We show that even for non-integrable mappings in this class, the surfaces forming these spaces have effective anticanonical divisors and one can define a period map parametrising them, similar to that in the theory of rational surfaces associated with discrete Painlev\'e equations. This provides a bridge between the evolution of coefficients in the deautonomised mapping and the induced dynamics on the Picard lattice which encode the dynamical degree.</description>

      <title>The Stack of Triangles up to Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a smooth compactification of the space of similarity classes of labeled, oriented, possibly-degenerate triangles that includes all degenerate configurations. The space $\mathbb D$, a connected sum of three projective planes, projects via blowdown to two shape spaces that have appeared in the literature, the well-known (Riemann) sphere (\cite{Kend84}, \cite{Beh}, \cite{ES15}), and the less-well-known 2-torus (\cite{BG23}). A natural action by the dihedral group $D_6$ defines a quotient stack $[\mathbb D/D_6]$, which is the stack of the absolute (unlabeled, unoriented) possibly-degenerate classes.</description>
