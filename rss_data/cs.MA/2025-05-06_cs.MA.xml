      <title>Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changing using Decentralised Safety Shields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities, such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.</description>

      <title>Pathfinders in the Sky: Formal Decision-Making Models for Collaborative Air Traffic Control in Convective Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air traffic can be significantly disrupted by weather. Pathfinder operations involve assigning a designated aircraft to assess whether airspace that was previously impacted by weather can be safely traversed through. Despite relatively routine use in air traffic control, there is little research on the underlying multi-agent decision-making problem. We seek to address this gap herein by formulating decision models to capture the operational dynamics and implications of pathfinders. Specifically, we construct a Markov chain to represent the stochastic transitions between key operational states (e.g., pathfinder selection). We then analyze its steady-state behavior to understand long-term system dynamics. We also propose models to characterize flight-specific acceptance behaviors (based on utility trade-offs) and pathfinder selection strategies (based on sequential offer allocations). We then conduct a worst-case scenario analysis that highlights risks from collective rejection and explores how selfless behavior and uncertainty affect system resilience. Empirical analysis of data from the US Federal Aviation Administration demonstrates the real-world significance of pathfinder operations and informs future model calibration.</description>

      <title>Act Natural! Extending Naturalistic Projection to Multimodal Behavior Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in public spaces must consider how their behaviors might affect the humans around them, even when not directly interacting with them. To this end, it is often beneficial to be predictable and appear naturalistic. Existing methods for this purpose use human actor intent modeling or imitation learning techniques, but these approaches rarely capture all possible motivations for human behavior and/or require significant amounts of data. Our work extends a technique for modeling unimodal naturalistic behaviors with an explicit convex set representation, to account for multimodal behavior by using multiple convex sets. This more flexible representation provides a higher degree of fidelity in data-driven modeling of naturalistic behavior that arises in real-world scenarios in which human behavior is, in some sense, discrete, e.g. whether or not to yield at a roundabout. Equipped with this new set representation, we develop an optimization-based filter to project arbitrary trajectories into the set so that they appear naturalistic to humans in the scene, while also satisfying vehicle dynamics, actuator limits, etc. We demonstrate our methods on real-world human driving data from the inD (intersection) and rounD (roundabout) datasets.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Governance (HAIG): A Trust-Utility Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g., "human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions (Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds (critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they emerge.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Media Perspectives: A Comprehensive Methodology Combining Large Language Models, Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, and Ontology Learning to Analyse Media Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biased news reporting poses a significant threat to informed decision-making and the functioning of democracies. This study introduces a novel methodology for scalable, minimally biased analysis of media bias in political news. The proposed approach examines event selection, labeling, word choice, and commission and omission biases across news sources by leveraging natural language processing techniques, including hierarchical topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and ontology learning with large language models. Through three case studies related to current political events, we demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness in identifying biases across news sources at various levels of granularity. This work represents a significant step towards scalable, minimally biased media bias analysis, laying the groundwork for tools to help news consumers navigate an increasingly complex media landscape.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Resilient Distributed Single Time-Scale Estimators: A Graph-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed estimation in interconnected systems has gained increasing attention due to its relevance in diverse applications such as sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. In real practice, the sensor network may suffer from communication and/or sensor failures. This might be due to cyber-attacks, faults, or environmental conditions. Distributed estimation resilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the sensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we introduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed estimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes the network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii) reduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by avoiding the inner consensus loop.
  On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks, resulting in biased measurements. Removing these sensor data may result in observability loss. Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions of $q$-node-connectivity and $q$-link-connectivity, which capture robust strong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure. By proper design of the sensor network, we prove Schur stability of the proposed distributed estimation protocol under failure of up to $q$ sensors or $q$ communication links.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM Agents and Digital Twins for Fault Handling in Process Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence continue to enhance the autonomy of process plants in handling various operational scenarios. However, certain tasks, such as fault handling, remain challenging, as they rely heavily on human expertise. This highlights the need for systematic, knowledge-based methods. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment. The LLM agents continuously interpret system states and initiate control actions, including responses to unexpected faults, with the goal of returning the system to normal operation. In this context, the Digital Twin acts both as a structured repository of plant-specific engineering knowledge for agent prompting and as a simulation platform for the systematic validation and verification of the generated corrective control actions. The evaluation using a mixing module of a process plant demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable not only of autonomously controlling the mixing module, but also of generating effective corrective actions to mitigate a pipe clogging with only a few reprompts.</description>

      <title>Open Challenges in Multi-Agent Security: Towards Secure Systems of Interacting AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized AI agents will soon interact across internet platforms, creating security challenges beyond traditional cybersecurity and AI safety frameworks. Free-form protocols are essential for AI's task generalization but enable new threats like secret collusion and coordinated swarm attacks. Network effects can rapidly spread privacy breaches, disinformation, jailbreaks, and data poisoning, while multi-agent dispersion and stealth optimization help adversaries evade oversightcreating novel persistent threats at a systemic level. Despite their critical importance, these security challenges remain understudied, with research fragmented across disparate fields including AI security, multi-agent learning, complex systems, cybersecurity, game theory, distributed systems, and technical AI governance. We introduce \textbf{multi-agent security}, a new field dedicated to securing networks of decentralized AI agents against threats that emerge or amplify through their interactionswhether direct or indirect via shared environmentswith each other, humans, and institutions, and characterize fundamental security-performance trade-offs. Our preliminary work (1) taxonomizes the threat landscape arising from interacting AI agents, (2) surveys security-performance tradeoffs in decentralized AI systems, and (3) proposes a unified research agenda addressing open challenges in designing secure agent systems and interaction environments. By identifying these gaps, we aim to guide research in this critical area to unlock the socioeconomic potential of large-scale agent deployment on the internet, foster public trust, and mitigate national security risks in critical infrastructure and defense contexts.</description>

      <title>Resolving Conflicting Constraints in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Layered Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preventing collisions in multi-robot navigation is crucial for deployment. This requirement hinders the use of learning-based approaches, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), on their own due to their lack of safety guarantees. Traditional control methods, such as reachability and control barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when interactions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts between the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe multi-agent coordination.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple layers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to learn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple indicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to result in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for agents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the most urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides tactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design decisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability analysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism.
  We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using Crazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation scenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding collisions. The results show that our method significantly reduces conflict while maintaining safety without sacrificing much efficiency (i.e., shorter travel time and distance) compared to baselines that do not incorporate layered safety.

      <description>arXiv:2505.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging &gt;87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.</description>

Abstract: With the launch of foundation models like DeepSeek, Manus AI, and Llama 4, it has become evident that large language models (LLMs) are no longer the sole defining factor in generative AI. As many now operate at comparable levels of capability, the real race is not about having the biggest model but optimizing the surrounding ecosystem, including data quality and management, computational efficiency, latency, and evaluation frameworks. This review article delves into these critical differentiators that ensure modern AI services are efficient and profitable.</description>

      <title>Modeling AI-Human Collaboration as a Multi-Agent Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an agent-based simulation to formalize AI-human collaboration as a function of task structure, advancing a generalizable framework for strategic decision-making in organizations. Distinguishing between heuristic-based human adaptation and rule-based AI search, we model interactions across modular (parallel) and sequenced (interdependent) tasks using an NK model. Our results reveal that in modular tasks, AI often substitutes for humans - delivering higher payoffs unless human expertise is very high, and the AI search space is either narrowly focused or extremely broad. In sequenced tasks, interesting complementarities emerge. When an expert human initiates the search and AI subsequently refines it, aggregate performance is maximized. Conversely, when AI leads, excessive heuristic refinement by the human can reduce payoffs. We also show that even "hallucinatory" AI - lacking memory or structure - can improve outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by helping escape local optima. These results yield a robust implication: the effectiveness of AI-human collaboration depends less on context or industry, and more on the underlying task structure. By elevating task decomposition as the central unit of analysis, our model provides a transferable lens for strategic decision-making involving humans and an agentic AI across diverse organizational settings.</description>

      <title>ResearchCodeAgent: An LLM Multi-Agent System for Automated Codification of Research Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce ResearchCodeAgent, a novel multi-agent system leveraging large language models (LLMs) agents to automate the codification of research methodologies described in machine learning literature. The system bridges the gap between high-level research concepts and their practical implementation, allowing researchers auto-generating code of existing research papers for benchmarking or building on top-of existing methods specified in the literature with availability of partial or complete starter code. ResearchCodeAgent employs a flexible agent architecture with a comprehensive action suite, enabling context-aware interactions with the research environment. The system incorporates a dynamic planning mechanism, utilizing both short and long-term memory to adapt its approach iteratively. We evaluate ResearchCodeAgent on three distinct machine learning tasks with distinct task complexity and representing different parts of the ML pipeline: data augmentation, optimization, and data batching. Our results demonstrate the system's effectiveness and generalizability, with 46.9% of generated code being high-quality and error-free, and 25% showing performance improvements over baseline implementations. Empirical analysis shows an average reduction of 57.9% in coding time compared to manual implementation. We observe higher gains for more complex tasks. ResearchCodeAgent represents a significant step towards automating the research implementation process, potentially accelerating the pace of machine learning research.</description>
