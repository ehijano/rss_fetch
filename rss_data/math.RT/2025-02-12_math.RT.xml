      <title>Gelfand--Graev representation as a Hecke algebra module of simple types of a finite central cover of $\mathrm{GL}(r)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-fold Kazhdan--Patterson cover or Savin's cover of a general linear group over a non-archimedean local field of residual characteristic $p$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(n,p)=1$, we realize the Gelfand--Graev representation as a Hecke algebra module of a simple type and study its explicit expression. As a main corollary, we calculate the Whittaker dimension of every discrete series representation of such a cover. Using Zelevinsky's classification, this theoretically gives the Whittaker dimension of every irreducible representation.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>On $A$-parameters containing unitary lowest weight representations of $\mathrm{U}(p, q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine all the Arthur packets containing an irreducible unitary lowest weight representation $\pi$ of real unitary group $G = \mathrm{U}(p, q)$, including non-scalar cases. Our methods are the Barbasch-Vogan parametrization of representations of $G$ and Trapa's algorithm to calculate the cohomologically induced representations. In particular, we show that an Arthur packet has at most one irreducible unitary lowest weight representation of $G$. As a consequence, if an irreducible unitary lowest weight representation $\pi$ exists in the Arthur packet of $\psi$, we give an explicit formula of the lowest $K$-type of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Free Jordan Algebras and Representations of sl_2(J)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let J be a unital Jordan algebra and let sl_2(J) be the universal central extension of the Tits-Kantor-Koecher Lie algebra TKK(J).
  In part A, we study the category of (sl_2(J), SL_2(K))-modules. We characterize the dominant J-spaces, which are analogous to the classical notion of dominant highest weights. We also show some finitness results.
  For an augmented Jordan algebra J, we define in Part C the notion of smooth modules. We investigate the corresponding category in the spirit of Cline-Parshall-Scott highest weight categories. We show that the standard modules are finite dimensional if J is a finitely generated.
  Let J(D) be the free unital Jordan algebra over $D$ variables. The results of Part A suggest that the Lie algebra sl_2(J(D+1)) is FP_\infty. Similarly the results of part C suggest that the category of smooth sl_2(J(D))-modules is a generalized highest weight category. We show that both hypothesis implies the conjecture of [KM] about the dimensions of the homogenous components of $J(D)$.
  Surprisingly, the proofs of most results make use of some deep results of E. Zelmanov.</description>

      <title>Extriangulated length categories: torsion classes and $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of extriangulated length categories, whose prototypical examples include abelian length categories and bounded derived categories of finite dimensional algebras with finite global dimension. We prove that an extriangulated category $\mathcal{A}$ is a length category if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ admits a simple-minded system. Subsequently, we study the partially ordered set ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ of torsion classes in an extriangulated length category $(\mathcal{A},\Theta)$ from the perspective of lattice theory. It is shown that ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ forms a complete lattice, which is further proved to be completely semidistributive and algebraic. Moreover, we describe the arrows in the Hasse quiver of ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ using brick labeling. Finally, we introduce the concepts of support torsion classes and support $\tau$-tilting subcategories in extriangulated length categories and establish a bijection between these two notions, thereby generalizing the Adachi-Iyama-Reiten bijection for functorially finite torsion classes.</description>

      <title>The Affine Tamari Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a fixed integer $n\geq 2$, we construct two new finite lattices that we call the cyclic Tamari lattice and the affine Tamari lattice. The cyclic Tamari lattice is a sublattice and a quotient lattice of the cyclic Dyer lattice, which is the infinite lattice of translation-invariant total orders under containment of inversion sets. The affine Tamari lattice is a quotient of the Dyer lattice, which in turn is a quotient of the cyclic Dyer lattice and is isomorphic to the collection of biclosed sets of the root system of type $\widetilde{A}_{n-1}$ under inclusion. We provide numerous combinatorial and algebraic descriptions of these lattices using translation-invariant total orders, translation-invariant binary in-ordered trees, noncrossing arc diagrams, torsion classes, triangulations, and translation-invariant noncrossing partitions. The cardinalities of the cyclic and affine Tamari lattices are the Catalan numbers of types $B_n$ and $D_n$, respectively. We show that these lattices are self-dual and semidistributive, and we describe their decompositions coming from the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Semidistributive Lattices. We also show that the rowmotion operators on these lattices have well-behaved orbit structures, which we describe via the cyclic sieving phenomenon. Our new combinatorial framework allows us to prove that the lengths of maximal green sequences for the completed path algebra of the oriented $n$-cycle are precisely the integers in the interval $[2n-1,\binom{n+1}{2}]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce higher-dimensional module factorizations associated to a regular sequence. They include higher-dimensional matrix factorizations, which are commutative cubes consisting of free modules with edges being classical matrix factorizations. We characterize the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over a complete intersection via higher-dimensional matrix factorizations over the corresponding regular local ring. The result generalizes to noncommutative rings, including quantum complete intersections.</description>

      <title>Gauge Origami and BPS/CFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\times \mathbb{C}^{4}$ and its BPS/CFT correspondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system arise from D0-branes bound to D$(2p)$-branes wrapping cycles in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is understood as an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten index of it produces the instanton partition function. We define a $q$-deformed quiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and introduce vertex operators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral formula for the Witten index has a nice free field realization. Such free field realization leads to the concept of BPS $qq$-characters or BPS quiver W-algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

      <title>A uniform trigonometric R-matrix for the exceptional series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exceptional series is a finite list of points on a projective line with a simple Lie algebra attached to each point. This list of Lie algebras includes the five exceptional Lie algebras. We give a uniform trigonometric $R$-matrix for the exceptional series in the representation $L\oplus I$, where $L$ is the quantum deformation of the adjoint representation and $I$ is the trivial representation. We construct a sixteen dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit2)$, which interpolates the algebras $\mathrm{End}(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ and a 287 dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit3)$, which interpolates the algebras $\mathrm{End}(\otimes^3(L\oplus I))$. The $R$-matrix lives in $A^\square(\mathit2)$ and satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation in $A^\square(\mathit3)$; it interpolates the trigonometric $R$-matrices for the points in the exceptional series.</description>

      <title>Finiteness properties of generalized Montr\'eal functors with applications to mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second named author previously constructed a functor $\mathbb{V}^\vee\circ D^\vee_\Delta$ from the category of smooth $p$-power torsion representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to the category of inductive limits of continuous representations on finite $p$-primary abelian groups of the direct product $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p,\Delta}\times \mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ of $(n-1)$ copies of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and one copy of the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$. In the present work we show that this functor attaches finite dimensional representations on the Galois side to smooth $p$-power torsion representations of finite length on the automorphic side. This has some implications on the finiteness properties of Breuil's functor, too. Moreover, $\mathbb{V}^\vee\circ D^\vee_\Delta$ produces irreducible representations of $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p,\Delta}\times \mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ when applied to irreducible objects on the automorphic side and detects isomorphisms unless it vanishes. Further, we determine the kernel of $D^\vee_\Delta$ when restricted to successive extensions of subquotients of principal series. We use this to characterize representations that are parabolically induced from the product of a torus and $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Finally, we formulate a conjecture and prove partial results on the essential image.</description>
