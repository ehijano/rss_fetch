      <title>The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a future CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band, by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. The project is in the framework of the Italian Space Agency Alcor Program, which aims to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP is approved for a Phase B study that will last for 12 months, starting in mid-2024. We report on the current status of the CUSP mission project as the outcome of the Phase A.</description>

      <title>Towards imaging-spectro-polarimetry of solar flares in the X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry of solar flares is still a not well established field of observation of our star. Past polarimeters were not able to measure with a high significance the polarization in X-rays from solar flares. Moreover, they had no imaging capabilities and measured only the polarization by integrating on all the image of the source. We propose a mission concept based on a gas photoelectric polarimeter, coupled with multilayer lobster-eye optics, to perform imaging-spectro-polarimetry of solar flares while monitoring the entire solar disc.</description>

      <title>Vector beam mapping at millimeter wavelengths using a robot arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many experimental efforts are striving to provide deep maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to shed light on key questions in modern cosmology. The primary science goal for some of these experiments is to further constrain the energy scale of cosmic inflation. It has been shown that these experiments are particularly sensitive to optical systematics. Near-field vector beam mapping, or holography, is now employed in a variety of CMB-focused experimental efforts due to the technique's ability to provide full details of electromagnetic field propagation through complex systems. In this proceeding, we describe the development of a measurement bench for millimeter-wave phase-sensitive beam mapping with the goal of characterizing optical components for CMB experiments. We discuss the testing of a beam scanner based on a 6-axis robot arm, the related custom control software, the readout architecture, and the overall validation of the system through various testing procedures. Dynamic range of 70 dB is demonstrated for the presented setup. With the current mechanical setup, we derive an upper limits of 45 $\mu$m on the absolute positioning error and 10 $\mu$m on positional repeatability.</description>

      <title>Beam Maps of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Measured with a Drone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present beam measurements of the CHIME telescope using a radio calibration source deployed on a drone payload. During test flights, the pulsing calibration source and the telescope were synchronized to GPS time, enabling in-situ background subtraction for the full $N^{2}$ visibility matrix for one CHIME cylindrical reflector. We use the autocorrelation products to estimate the primary beam width and centroid location, and compare these quantities to solar transit measurements and holographic measurements where they overlap on the sky. We find that the drone, solar, and holography data have similar beam parameter evolution across frequency and both spatial coordinates. This paper presents the first drone-based beam measurement of a large cylindrical radio interferometer. Furthermore, the unique analysis and instrumentation described in this paper lays the foundation for near-field measurements of experiments like CHIME.</description>

      <title>Panopticon: a telescope for our times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a design for a wide-field spectroscopic telescope. The only large powered mirror is spherical, the resulting spherical aberration is corrected for each target separately, giving exceptional image quality. The telescope is a transit design, but still allows all-sky coverage. Three simultaneous modes are proposed: (a) natural seeing multi-object spectroscopy with 12m aperture over 3dg FoV with ~25,000 targets; (b) multi-object AO with 12m aperture over 3dg FoV with ~100 AO-corrected Integral Field Units each with 4 arcsec FoV; (c) ground layer AO-corrected integral field spectroscopy with 15m aperture and 13 arcmin FoV. Such a telescope would be uniquely powerful for large-area follow-up of imaging surveys; in each mode, the AOmega and survey speed exceed all existing facilities combined. The expected cost of this design is relatively modest, much closer to $500M than $1000M.</description>

      <title>Additive manufacturing in ceramics: targeting lightweight mirror applications in the visible, ultraviolet and X-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D printing) has clear benefits in the production of lightweight mirrors for astronomy: it can create optimised lightweight structures and combine multiple components into one. New capabilities in AM ceramics, silicon carbide infiltrated with silicon and fused silica, offer the possibility to combine the design benefits of AM with a material suitable for visible, ultraviolet and X-ray applications. This paper will introduce the printing methods and post-processing steps to convert AM ceramic samples into reflective mirrors. Surface roughness measurements after abrasive polishing of the AM ceramics will be presented.</description>

      <title>Imaging reconstruction method on X-ray data of CMOS polarimeter combined with coded aperture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarization is a powerful tool for unveiling the anisotropic characteristics of high-energy celestial objects. We present a novel imaging reconstruction method designed for hard X-ray polarimeters employing a Si CMOS sensor and coded apertures, which function as a photoelectron tracker and imaging optics, respectively. Faced with challenges posed by substantial artifacts and background noise in the coded aperture imaging associated with the conventional balanced correlation method, we adopt the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm as the foundation of our imaging reconstruction method. The newly developed imaging reconstruction method is validated with imaging polarimetry and a series of X-ray beam experiments. The method demonstrates the capability to accurately reproduce an extended source comprising multiple segments with distinct polarization degrees. Comparative analysis exhibits a significant enhancement in imaging reconstruction accuracy compared to the balanced correlation method, with the background noise levels reduced to 17%. The outcomes of this study enhance the feasibility of Cube-Sat imaging polarimetry missions in the hard X-ray band, as the combination of Si CMOS sensors and coded apertures is a promising approach for realizing it.</description>

      <title>Reflectance measurements of mm-wave absorbers using frequency-domain continuous wave THz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to high dynamic range and ease of use, continuous wave terahertz spectroscopy is an increasingly popular method for optical characterization of components used in cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. In this work, we describe an optical testbed that enables simultaneous measurements of transmission and reflection properties of various radiation absorbing dielectric materials, essential components in the reduction of undesired optical loading. To demonstrate the performance of the testbed, we have measured the reflection response of five absorbers commonly used for such applications: TKRAM, carbon- and iron-loaded Stycast, HR10, AN72, and an in-house 3D printed absorber across a frequency range of 100 to 500 GHz, for both S- and P-polarization, with incident angles varying from 15 to 45 degrees. We present results on both the specular and scattered reflection response of these absorbers.</description>

      <title>TransformerPayne: enhancing spectral emulation accuracy and data efficiency by capturing long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a plateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when inferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models to capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to The Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these models on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference. The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when trained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing 2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne. Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on the full dataset, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across all tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Tilt-to-length coupling in LISA Pathfinder: long-term stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tilt-to-length coupling during the LISA Pathfinder mission has been numerically and analytically modeled for particular timespans. In this work, we investigate the long-term stability of the coupling coefficients of this noise. We show that they drifted slowly (by 1\,$\mu$m/rad and 6$\times10^{-6}$ in 100 days) and strongly correlated to temperature changes within the satellite (8\,$\mu$m/rad/K and 30$\times10^{-6}$/K). Based on analytical TTL coupling models, we attribute the temperature-driven coupling changes to rotations of the test masses and small distortions in the optical setup. Particularly, we show that LISA Pathfinder's optical baseplate was bent during the cooldown experiment, which started in late 2016 and lasted several months.</description>

      <title>The path toward 500 $\mu$m depletion of AstroPix, a pixelated silicon HVCMOS sensor for space and EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise reconstruction of Compton-scatter events is paramount for an imaging medium-energy gamma-ray telescope. The proposed AMEGO-X is enabled by a silicon tracker utilizing AstroPix chips - a pixelated silicon HVCMOS sensor novel for space use. To achieve science goals, each 500 x 500 $\mu$m$^2$ pixel must be sensitive for energy deposits ranging from 25 - 700 keV with an energy resolution of 5 keV at 122 keV (&lt; 10%). This is achieved through depletion of the 500 $\mu$m thick sensor, although complete depletion poses an engineering and design challenge. This work will summarize the current status of depletion measurements highlighting direct measurement with TCT laser scanning and the agreement with simulation. Future plans for further testing will also be identified.</description>

      <title>The first catalogue of candidate white dwarf-main sequence binaries in open star clusters: A new window into common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close binary systems are the progenitors to both Type Ia supernovae and the compact object mergers that can be detected via gravitational waves. To achieve a binary with a small radial separation, it is believed that the system likely undergoes common envelope (CE) evolution. Despite its importance, CE evolution may be one of the largest uncertainties in binary evolution due to a combination of computational challenges and a lack of observed benchmarks where both the post-CE and pre-CE conditions are known. Identifying post-CE systems in star clusters can partially circumvent this second issue by providing an independent age constraint on the system. For the first time, we conduct a systematic search for white dwarf (WD) and main-sequence (MS) binary systems in 299 Milky Way open star clusters. Coupling Gaia DR3 photometry and kinematics with multi-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS, we apply a machine learning based approach and find 52 high-probability candidates in 38 open clusters. For a subset of our systems, we present follow-up spectroscopy from the Gemini and Lick Observatories and archival light curves from TESS, Kepler/K2 and the Zwicky Transient Facility. Examples of M-dwarfs with hot companions are spectroscopically observed, along with regular system variability. While the kinematics of our candidates are consistent with their host clusters, some systems have spatial positions offset relative to their hosts, potentially indicative of natal kicks. Ultimately, this catalogue is a first step to obtaining a set of observational benchmarks to better link post-CE systems to their pre-CE progenitors.</description>

      <title>Lunar Time in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the general-relativistic definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) based on the IAU 2000 resolutions that provide a framework of relativistic reference systems. From this foundation, we derive a transformation equation that describes the relative rate of TCL with respect to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG). This equation serves as the cornerstone for constructing a relativistic TCL--TCG time conversion algorithm. Using this algorithm, we can compute both secular and periodic variations in the rate of an atomic clock placed on the Moon, relative to an identical clock on Earth. The algorithm accounts for various effects, including time dilation caused by the Moon's orbital motion around Earth, gravitational potentials of both Earth and Moon, and direct and indirect time dilation effects due to tidal perturbations caused by the Sun. Our approach provides exquisite details of the TCL--TCG transformation, accurate to a precision of 1 nanosecond. To validate our methodology for lunar coordinate time, we compare it with the formalism of local inertial frames applied to the Earth-Moon system and confirm their equivalence.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: first data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first public data release of the S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS), a photometric survey with short exposure times, covering approximately 9300 deg$^{2}$ of the Southern sky. The USS utilizes the Javalambre 12-band magnitude system, including narrow and medium-band and broad-band filters targeting prominent stellar spectral features. The primary objective of the USS is to identify bright, extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -3$) and ultra metal-poor (UMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -4$) stars for further analysis using medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy.}{This paper provides an overview of the survey observations, calibration method, data quality, and data products. Additionally, it presents the selection of EMP and UMP candidates.}{The data from the USS were reduced and calibrated using the same methods as presented in the S-PLUS DR2. An additional step was introduced, accounting for the offset between the observed magnitudes off the USS and the predicted magnitudes from the very low-resolution Gaia XP spectra.}{This first release contains data for 163 observed fields totaling $\sim$324 deg$^{2}$ along the Celestial Equator. The magnitudes obtained from the USS are well-calibrated, showing a difference of $\sim 15$ mmag compared to the predicted magnitudes by the GaiaXPy toolkit. By combining colors and magnitudes, 140 candidates for EMP or UMP have been identified for follow-up studies.}{The S-PLUS USS DR1 is an important milestone in the search for bright metal-poor stars, with magnitudes in the range 10 $ &lt; r \leq 14$. The USS is an ongoing survey; in the near future, it will provide many more bright metal-poor candidate stars for spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>Signature of high-amplitude pulsations in seven Delta Sct stars via TESS observations</title>

Abstract: The regular behavior of the pulsations of high-amplitude Delta Sct (HADS) stars gives a greater chance to investigate the interiors of stars. We analyzed seven HADS stars showing peak-to-peak amplitudes of more than 0.3 mag that were newly observed by TESS. We obtained that TIC374753270, TIC710783, and TIC187386415 pulsate in fundamental radial mode, also, TIC130474019 and TIC160120432 show double radial modes. On the other hand, TIC148357344 and TIC 278119167 demonstrate triple-mode behavior. Our analysis shows that these seven stars are close to the red edge of the (inside) instability strip in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram. The fundamental mode of these seven targets follows the period-luminosity (PL) relation for Delta Sct stars. However, TIC278119167 deviates slightly from the fundamental PL relation. The double-mode and triple-mode HADS stars (TIC130474019, TIC160120432, TIC148357344, and TIC278119167) are in agreement with the period ratio ranges (fundamental to first and second overtones). Using the information of 176 HADS stars (Netzel and Smolec), we find a scaling relation ([Fe/H] ~log((M**7.95+-0.15)(L**-1.83+-0.11)(P0**0.79+-0.14)(Teff**0.047+-0.02))) between the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and mass (M), luminosity (L), effective temperature (Teff), and the fundamental period (P0). We estimate the metallicity of the seven newly identified HADS stars ranging from -0.62 to 0.37 dex.</description>

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale ejections of magnetized plasma from the Sun and are associated with the most extreme space weather events. The geoeffectiveness of a CME is primarily determined by the southward component of its magnetic fields (CME-$B_z$). Recent studies have shown that CMEs evolve significantly in the inner heliosphere ($\sim20-90\ R_\odot$), and relying on extrapolations from low coronal heights can lead to wrong predictions of CME-$B_z$ in the vicinity of Earth. Hence, it is important to measure CME magnetic fields at these heights to improve CME-$B_z$ prediction. A promising method to measure the CME-entrained magnetic field in the inner heliosphere is by measuring the changes in Faraday rotation (FR) of linearly polarized emission from background radio sources as their line-of-sight crosses the CME plasma. Here, we present the current preparation of new-generation ground-based radio telescopes for this purpose.</description>

      <title>SSPARE: Space Solar Power Autonomously Reconfigurable Elements</title>

Abstract: GEO communication satellites generate significant revenue but can only function reliably for approximately 10 years on orbit. One of the main drivers that limits the reliability of a GEO satellite is the electric power system, and in particular, anomalies related to batteries and degradation of the solar arrays. Given the high cost and relatively short lifespan of GEO satellites, there has been increased research activity towards developing on-orbit servicing systems. However, most of the existing servicing systems are expensive, highly customized, and focus on refueling tasks. On-orbit refueling can be very useful, however, it does not improve satellite reliability which is crucial for long-term missions. Therefore, we propose SSPARE (Space Solar Power Autonomously Reconfigurable Elements), a cost-effective, self-servicing power system. Aside from improving satellite reliability, SSPARE enables to generate up to 6 times more power per launch compared to a traditional GEO communication satellite. This study explores why GEO satellites fail and elaborates on the SSPARE concept. A comparison of SSPARE against a traditional on-orbit servicing mission highlights the benefits of the proposed concept. With humanity striving to become more and more Earth-independent, this work aims to build a foundation for future systems such as large solar power farms on-orbit.</description>

      <title>A deep analysis for New Horizons' KBO search images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observation datasets acquired by the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope for NASA's New Horizons mission target search were analyzed through a method devised by JAXA. The method makes use of Field Programmable Gate arrays and was originally used to detect fast-moving objects such as space debris or near-Earth asteroids. Here we present an application of the method to detect slow-moving Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) in the New Horizons target search observations. A cadence that takes continuous images of one HSC field of view for half a night fits the method well. The observations for the New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (NH/KEM) using HSC began in May 2020, and are ongoing. Here we show our result of the analysis of the dataset acquired from May 2020 through June 2021 that have already passed the proprietary period and are open to the public. We detected 84 KBO candidates in the June 2020 and June 2021 datasets, when the observation field was close to opposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and the prototype of a multisensory planetarium. The goal of this project is to offer a common perceptual and cognitive framework to all users, both sighted, deaf, and blind or visually impaired, concerning the experience of observing the night sky, but also to provide all equal access to scientific data regarding the observed objects, going beyond what can be sensed. The planetarium will consist of a Plexiglas hemisphere on which stars up to the fourth magnitude are represented by a brass bar that, when touched, activates visual, haptic, and acoustic stimuli. We mapped the magnitude of stars on acoustic and visual stimuli, while the distance of the star from us is mapped on a vibration. All the stimuli have been evaluated in pilot experiments using Plexiglas tablets representing some constellations, to assess their usability, intelligibility, and consistency with possible intuitive interpretations.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for assessing climatological surface habitability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary surface habitability has so far been, in the main, considered in its entirety. The increasing popularity of 3D modelling studies of (exo)planetary climate has highlighted the need for a new measure of surface habitability. Combining the observed thermal limits of modern Earth-based life with surface water fluxes, we introduce such a measure which can be calculated from the climatological outputs from general circulation model simulations. In particular, we pay attention to not only the thermal bounds of macroscopic complex life, but additionally the limits of microbial and extremophilic life which have been vital to the generation of Earth's own biosignatures. This new metric is validated on Earth, using ERA5 reanalysis data to predict the distribution of surface habitability which is compared to the observed habitability generated from satellite-derived data of photosynthetic life. The validation against observed habitability is additionally repeated for a selection of other defined metrics of surface habitability, allowing for the first time a comparison of metric performance with respect to Earth-based surface life, finding that future climatologically-based metric definitions should include both conditions for temperature and water/nutrient availability.</description>

      <title>1-arcsecond imaging of ELAIS-N1 field at 144MHz using the LoTSS survey with international LOFAR telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first wide area (2.5 x 2.5 deg^2) LOFAR High Band Antenna image at a resolution of 1.2'' x 2'' with a median noise of approximately 80 microJy per beam. It was made from an 8-hour International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) observation of the ELAIS-N1 field at frequencies ranging from 120 to 168 MHz with the most up-to-date ILT imaging methods. This intermediate resolution falls between the highest possible resolution (0.3'') achievable by using all International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) baselines and the standard 6-arcsecond resolution in the LoTSS (LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey) image products utilising the LOFAR Dutch baselines only. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility of imaging using the ILT at a resolution of around 1'', which provides unique information on source morphology at scales that fall below the surface brightness limits at higher resolutions. The total calibration and imaging computational time is approximately 52,000 core hours, nearly 5 times more than required to produce a 6'' resolution image. We also present a radio source catalogue containing 2263 sources detected over the 2.5 x 2.5 deg^2 image of the ELAIS-N1 field, with a peak intensity threshold of 5.5 sigma. The catalogue has been cross-matched with the LoTSS deep ELAIS-N1 field radio catalogue, and its flux density and positional accuracy have been investigated and corrected accordingly. We find that approximately 80% of sources which we expect to be detectable based on their peak brightness in the LoTSS 6'' resolution image are detected in this image, which is approximately a factor of two higher than for 0.3'' resolution imaging in the Lockman Hole, implying there is a wealth of information on these intermediate scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key to detecting neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR) is to separate the cosmological signal from the dominating foreground radiation. We developed direct optimal mapping (DOM) to map interferometric visibilities; it contains only linear operations, with full knowledge of point spread functions from visibilities to images. Here, we demonstrate a fast Fourier transform-based image power spectrum and its window functions computed from the DOM images. We use noiseless simulation, based on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array Phase I configuration, to study the image power spectrum properties. The window functions show $&lt;10^{-11}$ of the integrated power leaks from the foreground-dominated region into the EoR window; the 2D and 1D power spectra also verify the separation between the foregrounds and the EoR.</description>

Abstract: The microseismic motion, ambient ground vibration caused by ocean waves, affects ground-based gravitational wave detectors. In this study, characteristics of the ocean waves including seasonal variations and correlation coefficients were investigated for the significant wave heights at 13 coasts in Japan. The relationship between the ocean waves and the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site was also evaluated. As a result, it almost succeeded in explaining the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site by the principal components of the ocean wave data. One possible application of this study is microseismic forecasting, an example of which is also presented.</description>

      <title>The Resident Space Objects Network: a complex system approach for shaping space sustainability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14795v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-Earth space continues to be the focus of critical services and capabilities provided to the society. With the steady increase of space traffic, the number of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) has recently boomed in the context of growing concern due to space debris. The need of a holistic and unified approach for addressing orbital collisions, assess the global in-orbit risk, and define sustainable practices for space traffic management has emerged as a major societal challenge. Here, we introduce and discuss a versatile framework rooted on the use of the complex network paradigm to introduce a novel risk index for space sustainability criteria. With an entirely data-driven, but flexible, formulation, we introduce the Resident Space Object Network (RSONet) by connecting RSOs that experience near-collisions events over a finite-time window. The structural collisional properties of RSOs are thus encoded into the RSONet and analysed with the tools of network science. We formulate a geometrical index highlighting the key role of specific RSOs in building up the risk of collisions with respect to the rest of the population. Practical applications based on Two-Line Elements and Conjunction Data Message databases are presented.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Atmosphere-Skimming Cosmic-Ray Showers in High-Altitude Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmosphere-skimming showers are initiated by cosmic rays with incoming directions such that the full development of the cascade occurs inside the atmosphere without ever reaching the ground. This new class of showers has been observed in balloon-borne experiments such as ANITA, but a characterisation of their properties is lacking. The interplay between the Earth's magnetic field, the long distances over which atmosphere-skimming showers develop, and the low density of the atmosphere they traverse gives rise to several effects that are not seen in downward-going cascades, and require detailed modeling. In this article, we used the latest version of the ZHAireS-RASPASS shower simulation program to tackle this problem, and dwell on the particular phenomena that arises from the peculiar environment on which these showers develop. We focus in particular on the properties of the longitudinal profile of the shower and its fluctuations as a function of cosmic-ray energy, direction and primary mass. We have also studied the phase-space of cosmic-ray arrival directions where detection in high-altitude experiments is more likely, and have found that only in a small range of directions the showers are sufficiently developed before reaching the altitude of the detector. Our results are relevant for the design of high-altitude and in particular balloon-borne experiments, and for the interpretation of the data they collect.</description>

      <title>Infrared-Radio-follow-up Observations for Detection of the Magnetic Radio Emission of Extra-Solar Planets: A New Window to Detect Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are several methods for indirectly detecting exoplanets, such as transit, radial velocity, astrometry, and the conventional gravitational microlensing approach. These methods rely on observing the effects of exoplanets on the emission or motion of observed stars. All these techniques have focused on the optical or infrared domains. However, an alternative method for exoplanet detection via microlensing events involves planets orbiting the source star, creating a binary source system. In this study, we explore a novel approach to detecting and studying exoplanets exclusively through their radio emissions resulting from magnetospheric processes. We propose utilizing the Roman telescope as a survey observer to detect microlensing events. Subsequently, we investigate the potential for detecting planetary radio signals through follow-up observations of these microlensing events in the radio band using the SKA telescope. This method is viable due to the comparable radio emission levels of exoplanets and their parent stars, unlike optical and infrared emissions. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to replicate the observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope, followed by a follow-up observation in radio frequencies using the SKA telescope. We determine that approximately 1317 exoplanets exhibit detectable signals by the SKA telescope during the 7-season observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope. This result indicates that such a method cannot only facilitate the direct detection of exoplanets but also enable the measurement of their magnetic field strength through analysis of their radio emissions.</description>

      <title>Archetype-Based Redshift Estimation for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient galaxy archetype-based redshift estimation and spectral classification method for the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) survey. The DESI survey currently relies on a redshift fitter and spectral classifier using a linear combination of PCA-derived templates, which is very efficient in processing large volumes of DESI spectra within a short time frame. However, this method occasionally yields unphysical model fits for galaxies and fails to adequately absorb calibration errors that may still be occasionally visible in the reduced spectra. Our proposed approach improves upon this existing method by refitting the spectra with carefully generated physical galaxy archetypes combined with additional terms designed to absorb data reduction defects and provide more physical models to the DESI spectra. We test our method on an extensive dataset derived from the survey validation (SV) and Year 1 (Y1) data of DESI. Our findings indicate that the new method delivers marginally better redshift success for SV tiles while reducing catastrophic redshift failure by $10-30\%$. At the same time, results from millions of targets from the main survey show that our model has relatively higher redshift success and purity rates ($0.5-0.8\%$ higher) for galaxy targets while having similar success for QSOs. These improvements also demonstrate that the main DESI redshift pipeline is generally robust. Additionally, it reduces the false positive redshift estimation by $5-40\%$ for sky fibers. We also discuss the generic nature of our method and how it can be extended to other large spectroscopic surveys, along with possible future improvements.</description>

Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>
