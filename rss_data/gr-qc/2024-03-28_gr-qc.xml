      <title>Neural Post-Einsteinian Framework for Efficient Theory-Agnostic Tests of General Relativity with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework and its variants are widely used to probe gravity through gravitational-wave tests that apply to a large class of theories beyond general relativity. However, the ppE framework is not truly theory-agnostic as it only captures certain types of deviations from general relativity: those that admit a post-Newtonian series representation in the inspiral of coalescencing compact objects. Moreover, each type of deviation in the ppE framework has to be tested separately, making the whole process computationally inefficient and expensive, possibly obscuring the theoretical interpretation of potential deviations that could be detected in the future. We here present the neural post-Einsteinian (npE) framework, an extension of the ppE formalism that overcomes the above weaknesses using deep-learning neural networks. The core of the npE framework is a variantional autoencoder that maps the discrete ppE theories into a continuous latent space in a well-organized manner. This design enables the npE framework to test many theories simultaneously and to select the theory that best describes the observation in a single parameter estimation run. The smooth extension of the ppE parametrization also allows for more general types of deviations to be searched for with the npE model. We showcase the application of the new npE framework to future tests of general relativity with the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. In particular, the npE framework is demonstrated to efficiently explore modifications to general relativity beyond what can be mapped by the ppE framework, including modifications coming from higher-order curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high post-Newtonian order, and dark-photon interactions in possibly hidden sectors of matter that do not admit a post-Newtonian representation.</description>

      <title>Fast and faithful interpolation of numerical relativity surrogate waveforms using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several theoretical waveform models have been developed over the years to capture the gravitational wave emission from the dynamical evolution of compact binary systems of neutron stars and black holes. As ground-based detectors improve their sensitivity at low frequencies, the real-time computation of these waveforms can become computationally expensive, exacerbating the steep cost of rapidly reconstructing source parameters using Bayesian methods. This paper describes an efficient numerical algorithm for generating high-fidelity interpolated compact binary waveforms at an arbitrary point in the signal manifold by leveraging computational linear algebra techniques such as singular value decomposition and meshfree approximation. The results are presented for the time-domain \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveform model that is fine tuned to numerical relativity simulations and parameterized by the two component-masses and two aligned spins. For demonstration, we target a specific region of the intrinsic parameter space inspired by the previously inferred parameters of the \texttt{GW200311\_115853} event -- a binary black hole system whose merger was recorded by the network of advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors during the third observation run. We show that the meshfree interpolated waveforms can be evaluated in $\sim 2.3$ ms, which is about $\times 38$ faster than its brute-force (frequency-domain tapered) implementation in the \textsc{PyCBC} software package at a median accuracy of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales favourably with an increasing number of dimensions of the parameter space. This technique may find use in rapid parameter estimation and source reconstruction studies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical reconstruction of the $\Lambda$CDM model in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply the formalism of dynamical systems to analyze the viability of the $\Lambda$CDM model in a generalized form of the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity theory written in terms of its dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor representation. Adopting a matter distribution composed of two relativistic fluids described by the equations of state of radiation and pressureless dust, one verifies that the cosmological phase space features the usual curvature-dominated, radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and exponentially accelerated fixed points, even in the absence of a dark energy component. A numerical integration of the dynamical equations describing the system, subjected to initial conditions consistent with the cosmographic observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, shows that cosmological solutions with the same behavior as the $\Lambda$CDM model in General Relativity (GR) are attainable in this theory, with the deviations from GR being exponentially suppressed at early-times and the scalar-field potential effectively playing the role of dark energy at late times.</description>

      <title>Exploring critical behavior of thermodynamic variables of the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole in the restricted phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work delves into examining the thermodynamic properties of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newmann-AdS black hole, employing the recently proposed framework of restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST). This approach introduces a novel set of paired thermodynamic variables: the central charge $C$ of the corresponding dual conformal field theory (CFT) and the chemical potential $\mu$. Through simple analysis, we establish fundamental relationships such as the Euler relation, Gibbs-Duhem relation, and the zeroth order homogeneity of intensive variables. Employing numerical techniques, we explore the thermodynamic processes between these conjugate variables. Our investigation reveals the first-order and second-order phase transitions across various macroscopic processes. Despite the absence of complete analytical expressions, our findings unveil striking similarities in behavior between RN-AdS and Kerr-AdS, underscoring the presence of underlying universality within the RPST formalism.</description>

      <title>Mass fluctuations in non-rotating BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of oscillations of a black-hole mass around its average value on the three-dimensional black hole geometry. Drawing on a classical framework that conceptualizes fluctuations near an event horizon as mass variations, we introduce a model where the metric of a black hole, formed from the collapse of a massive null shell, exhibits oscillatory behavior in spherical modes. This dynamic is encapsulated by a non-rotating BTZ-Vaidya solution, characterized by the black hole mass fluctuating at a resonant frequency $\omega$ and a small amplitude parameter $\mu_0$. Using a perturbative approach, solutions to the null geodesic equation are determined up to the second order in $\mu_0$. The temporal fluctuations of the event horizon's location induce alterations in the thermodynamic variables' values. Upon calculating the time-averaged values, it is observed that the mean Hawking temperature experiences a slight decrease due to these fluctuations, while the mean entropy exhibits an increase, deviating from trends observed in four- and higher-dimensional spacetimes. Further, the study delves into the influence of these fluctuations on the trajectories of null rays near the horizon, ultimately reaching the anti-de Sitter boundary at late times. The analytical computation of the general solution for the perturbed rays up to the second order underscores the novel approach of this study in examining the effects of mass oscillations on black hole thermodynamics and geometry, contributing a unique perspective to the field.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Petrov type D horizons of non-trivial $U(1)$ bundle structure over Riemann surfaces with genus $&gt; 0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider isolated horizons (Killing horizons up to the second order) whose null flow has the structure of a U(1) principal fiber bundle over a compact Riemann surface. We impose the vacuum Einstein equations (with the cosmological constant) and the condition that the spacetime Weyl tensor is of Petrov D type on the geometry of the horizons. We derive all the solutions in the case when the genus of the surface is $&gt;1$. By doing so for all the non-trivial bundles, we complete the classification. We construct the embedding spacetimes and show that they are locally isometric to the toroidal or hyperbolic generalization of the Taub-NUT-(anti-) de Sitter spacetimes for horizons of genus $1$ or $&gt;1$ respectively, after performing Misner's identification of the spacetime. The horizon bundle structure can be naturally extended to bundle structure defined on the entire spacetime.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic instability and spontaneous scalarization in parameterized Schwarzschild-like black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization in parameterized Schwarzschild-like black holes. Two metrics are considered, the Konoplya-Zhidenko metric and the Johannsen-Psaltis metric. While these metrics can mimic the Schwarzschild black hole well in the weak-field regime, they have deformed geometries in the near-horizon strong-field region. Such deformations notably influence the emergence of tachyonic instability and subsequent spontaneous scalarization, enabling a clear distinction between these parameterized metrics and the standard Schwarzschild metric. These results suggest a possible way to test the parameterized black holes and thus the Kerr hypothesis by observing the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Maximum Masses of White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, and Exotic Stars in Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of astronomical observations opens the possibility of testing our current understanding of gravitational theory in the strong-field regime and probing any deviation from general relativity. We explore to what extent compact stars predicted by non-minimal derivative coupling (NMDC) gravity theory agree with observed data. We investigate white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), and quark stars (QSs) mass and radius in various values of constant scalar $|Q_{\infty}|$ at coupling strength of $\eta=\pm1$. This study focuses on the astrophysical impacts of altering maximum masses by values of $|Q_{\infty}|$ and $\eta$. From an observational point of view, we found that WD stars are consistent with ultra-cold WD data at $|Q_{\infty}| \lesssim 0.2$. We also found that QS has a similar impact of mass-radius to NS, where the modification is more significant at higher (central) density. For NS and QS EoSs, the value $|Q_{\infty}|$ strongly alters the critical mass and might eliminate the $M-\rho_c$ turning point in the negative $\eta$ case. In that case, the sufficiently large $|Q_{\infty}|$ could predict $M&gt;2.6 M_\odot$ NS and QS, i.e., larger than GW190814 secondary counterpart. We suggest that the lower mass gap in the gravitational wave and x-ray binary mass population data might restrict the theory's $|Q_{\infty}|$.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Transit cosmological model in $f(R,T^{\phi})$ theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have explored a transitioning cosmic model, depicting late-time accelerated expansion in $f(R,T^{\phi})$ theory of gravity for an isotropic and homogeneous universe, where the trace of energy-momentum tensor $T^{\phi}$ is the function of the self-interacting scalar field $\phi$. We have proposed an explicit solution to the derived model by utilizing a scale factor of the hybrid form $a(t) = t^{\alpha} e^{\beta t}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants. To evaluate the best-fit values of free parameters of the suggested model, the statistical analysis based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been employed on 57 OHD points. We have described the dynamical features of the model like energy density, cosmic pressure, and equation of state parameter in the context of scalar field $\phi$. We have also described the potential and behavior of the scalar field for quintessence and phantom scenarios. The deceleration parameter depicts a transitioning universe with signature flipping at $z_t = 0.82$ with the present value of deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.41$. The violation of SEC for the derived model indicates the cosmic expansion at a faster rate. We have used statefinders to diagnose the model. The findings for our theoretical model indicate that the derived model agrees with observed findings within a particular range of limitations.</description>

      <title>Effects of lunisolar perturbations on TianQin constellation: An analytical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational-wave observatory mission that critically relies on the stability of an equilateral-triangle constellation. Comprising three satellites in high Earth orbits of a $ 10^5 $ km radius, this constellation's geometric configuration is significantly affected by gravitational perturbations, primarily originating from the Moon and the Sun. In this paper, we present an analytical model to quantify the effects of lunisolar perturbations on the TianQin constellation, derived using Lagrange's planetary equations. The model provides expressions for three kinematic indicators of the constellation: arm-lengths, relative line-of-sight velocities, and breathing angles. Analysis of these indicators reveals that lunisolar perturbations can distort the constellation triangle, resulting in three distinct variations: linear drift, bias, and fluctuation. Furthermore, it is shown that these distortions can be optimized to display solely fluctuating behavior, under certain predefined conditions. These results can serve as the theoretical foundation for numerical simulations and offer insights for engineering a stable constellation in the future.</description>

      <title>Classical Kerr-Schild double copy in bigravity for maximally symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz is proposed for the two metrics in bigravity which leads to linear interactions between the metrics and can be studied in the context of the double copy. By contracting the resulting spin-2 field bigravity equations of motion using Killing vector fields, we arrive to the single and zeroth copy equations for our ansatz. For the case of stationary solutions, we obtain two Maxwell and two conformally coupled equations for the single and zeroth copy respectively, and we do not have linear interactions. In the time-dependent case we obtain equations for our fields which are coupled. By decoupling these equations and at the zeroth copy level, we obtain a massless and a massive field whose mass is proportional to the Fierz-Pauli mass and depends on the interaction coefficients of the interaction potential between the metrics.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the leading ideas for the beginning of the Universe is the Hartle-Hawking `No-Boundary Proposal.' Since the Cobordism Conjecture claims that any spacetime allows for a dynamical boundary, we suggest that one may equally well consider a `Boundary Proposal'. Specifically, the corresponding euclidean instanton is a sphere with two holes around north and south pole cut out. Analogously to the Hartle-Hawking proposal, the sphere is then cut in two at the equator and half of it is dropped. The equator is glued to an expanding Lorentzian de Sitter space, implementing a beginning of the Universe with a spacelike spherical boundary at its earliest moment. This process is in principle on equal footing with the one based on the no-boundary instanton. In fact, if the Linde-Vilenkin sign choice is used, this `Boundary' creation process may even dominate. An intriguing implication arises if tensionless end-of-the-world branes, as familiar from type-IIA or M-theory, are available: Analogously to the Boundary Proposal, one may then be able to create a compact, flat torus universe from nothing, without any exponential suppression or enhancement factors.</description>

      <title>Holographic description of closed FRW cosmologies and time-dependent ER=EPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a covariant holographic entanglement entropy prescription for a class of closed FRW cosmologies, generalizing a recent holographic proposal in de Sitter space. Starting from the Bousso covariant entropy bound, we describe the location of two holographic screens associated with a pair of antipodal observers, and then state our holographic proposal. We then apply our prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the two-screen and the single screen systems, focusing on the leading classical contributions of order $(G\hbar)^{-1}$. First, we show how the full spacetime is expected to be holographically encoded on the two screens. Second, we argue that the exterior region between the two screens behaves as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, arising from the entanglement between the holographic degrees of freedom as suggested by the ER=EPR conjecture. The entanglement between the two screens, or from the geometric point of view the area of the minimal extremal surface, varies during the cosmological evolution, hence entailing a time-dependent ER=EPR realization.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae have become increasingly mature and important in recent years. Magnetic fields take center stage in scenarios for explaining hypernova explosions, but are now also considered in supernova theory more broadly as an important factor even in neutrino-driven explosions, especially in the context of neutron star birth properties. Here we present an overview of simulation approaches currently used for magnetohydrodynamic supernova simulations and sketch essential physical concepts for understanding the role of magnetic fields in supernovae of slowly or rapidly rotating massive stars. We review progress on simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae, magnetorotational supernovae, and the relevant field amplification processes. Recent results on the nucleosynthesis and gravitational wave emission from magnetorotational supernovae are also discussed. We highlight efforts to provide better initial conditions for magnetohydrodynamic supernova models by simulating short phases of the progenitor evolution in 3D to address uncertainties in the treatment of rotation and magnetic fields in current stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Oscillating dark energy in light of the latest observations and its impact on the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we have performed a comparative study of different types of oscillating dark energy models using the Metropolis algorithm of MCMC. Eight different oscillating parameterization being examined herein which have demonstrated considerable ability to fit the overall cosmological observations including Pantheon sample of SnIa, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Chronometer Hubble data and distance priors of Planck CMB. In order to compare the consistency of these models with observations, we have used both Akaike and Deviation information criteria. Although, the values of Akaike information criteria for different models indicate that there is no support for oscillating DE models, Deviation information criteria showed that there is significant support for some of these models. Our results showed that these models are capable of solving cosmic coincidence problem and alleviating the Hubble tension. Comparing the $H_0$ values obtained for different oscillating scenarios, with that of $\Lambda$CDM, we observe that our oscillating models led to $\bar{H_0}=69.78$ which is $0.29$ greater than $H_{0,\Lambda}$ and thus reduce the Hubble tension. Among all of models, Model(1) with $H_0=70.00 \pm 0.71$ is the most capable of alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we examined our models assuming $H_0=73.0 \pm 1.4$ from SHoES measurements. We find that adding this data point to our data combination, led to a $\Delta \bar{H_0}=0.95$ increase in $H_0$ value for different models.</description>

      <title>Quantum focusing conjecture in two-dimensional evaporating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) for two-dimensional evaporating black holes. The QFC is closely related to the behavior of the generalized entropy -- the sum of the area entropy for a given co-dimension two surface and the entanglement entropy for quantum fields outside the area. In the context of the black hole evaporation, the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation is decreasing after the Page time, and therefore it is not obvious whether the QFC holds in the black hole evaporation process especially after the Page time. One of the present authors previously addressed this problem in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric dynamical black hole model and showed that the QFC is satisfied. However the background spacetime considered was approximated by the Vaidya metric, and quantum effects of matters in the semiclassical regime is not fully taken into consideration. It remains to be seen if the QFC in fact holds for exact solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this paper, we address this problem in a two-dimensional dynamical black hole of the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius (RST) model, which allows us to solve the semiclassical equations of motion exactly. We first give a suitable definition of the quantum expansion in two-dimensions and then prove that the QFC is satisfied for evaporating black holes in the RST model with the island formation taken into account.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Formalism: Concrete Realization of Joint Measurement for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation for Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, $0=0$, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

      <title>Doubly special relativity as a non-local quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the technical details of the discussion presented in [J.J. Relancio, L.Santamar\'ia-Sanz (2024) arXiv:2403.18772], where we establish the basis of quantum theories of the free massive scalar, the massive fermionic, and the electromagnetic fields, in a doubly special relativity scenario. This construction is based on a geometrical interpretation of the kinematics of these kind of theories. In order to describe the modified actions, we find that a higher (indeed infinite) derivative field theory is needed, from which the deformed kinematics can be read. From our construction we are able to restrict the possible models of doubly special relativity to particular bases that preserve linear Lorentz invariance. We quantize the theories and also obtain a deformed version of the Maxwell equations. We analyze the electromagnetic vector potential either for an electric point-like source and a magnetic dipole. We observe that the electric and magnetic fields do not diverge at the origin for some models described with an anti de Sitter space but do for the de Sitter one in both problems.</description>

      <title>On the definition of the spin charge in asymptotically-flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a solution to a classic problem in gravitational physics consisting of defining the spin associated with asymptotically-flat spacetimes. We advocate that the correct asymptotic symmetry algebra to approach this problem is the generalized-BMS algebra $\textsf{gbms}$ instead of the BMS algebra used hitherto in the literature for which a notion of spin is generically unavailable. We approach the problem of defining the spin charges from the perspective of coadjoint orbits of $\textsf{gbms}$ and construct the complete set of Casimir invariants that determine $\textsf{gbms}$ coadjoint orbits, using the notion of vorticity for $\textsf{gbms}$. This allows us to introduce spin charges for $\textsf{gbms}$ as the generators of area-preserving diffeomorphisms forming its isotropy subalgebra. To elucidate the parallelism between our analysis and the Poincar\'e case, we clarify several features of the Poincar\'e embedding in $\textsf{gbms}$ and reveal the presence of condensate fields associated with the symmetry breaking from $\textsf{gbms}$ to Poincar\'e. We also introduce the notion of a rest frame available only for this extended algebra. This allows us to construct, from the spin generator, the gravitational analog of the Pauli--Luba\'nski pseudo-vector. Finally, we obtain the $\textsf{gbms}$ moment map, which we use to construct the gravitational spin charges and gravitational Casimirs from their dual algebra counterparts.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Matter Power Spectrum Modeling in Interacting Dark Energy Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model is crucial for accurately predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe in non-standard cosmologies. In this work, we present an analysis of the non-linear matter power spectrum within the framework of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmologies (IDE). We employ N-body simulations and theoretical models to investigate the impact of IDE on these non-linear scales. Beginning with N-body simulations characterized by a fixed parameter space delineated by prior observational research, we adeptly fit the simulated spectra with a simple parametric function, achieving accuracy within 5\%. Subsequently, we refine a modified halo model tailored to the IDE cosmology, exhibiting exceptional precision in fitting the simulations down to scales of approximately 1 h/Mpc. To assess the model's robustness, we conduct a forecast analysis for the Euclid survey, employing our refined model. We find that the coupling parameter $\xi$ will be constrained to $\sigma(\xi) = 0.0046$. This marks a significant improvement by an order of magnitude compared to any other current observational tests documented in the literature. These primary findings pave the way for a novel preliminary approach, enabling the utilization of IDE models for observational constraints concerning LSS data on non-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Consistency of JWST Black Hole Observations with NANOGrav Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have opened a new chapter in studies of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of SMBHs in the early Universe and the fraction of dual AGNs. In this paper we argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nHz gravitational wave (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in terms of SMBH binaries losing energy by interactions with their environments as well as by GW emission. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-$z$ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of the local SMBH population, which are mainly in inactive galaxies. This interpretation would favour the observability of GW signals from BH binaries in LISA and deciHz GW detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can generate electromagnetic effects inside a strong electric or magnetic field within the Standard Model and general relativity. Here we propose using a quarterly split cavity and LC(inductor and capacitor)-resonance circuit to detect a high-frequency gravitational wave from 0.1 MHz to GHz. We perform a full 3D simulation of the cavity's signal for sensitivity estimate. Our sensitivity depends on the coherence time scale of the high-frequency gravitational wave sources and the volume size of the split cavity. We discuss the resonant measurement schemes for narrow-band gravitational wave sources and also a non-resonance scheme for broadband signals. For a meter-sized split cavity under a 14 Tesla magnetic field, the LC resonance enhanced sensitivity to the gravitational wave strain is expected to reach $h\sim 10^{-20}$ around $10$ MHz.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the real-time dynamics during the spontaneous deformation of an unstable spherical black hole in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. For the initial value, the static solutions with spherical symmetry are obtained numerically, revealing the presence of a spinodal region in the phase diagram. From the linear stability analysis, we find that only the central part of such a thermodynamically unstable spinodal region leads to the emergence of a type of axial instability. To trigger the dynamical instability, an axial perturbation is imposed on the scalar field. As a result, by the fully nonlinear dynamical simulation, the spherical symmetry of the gravitational system is broken spontaneously, leading to the formation of an axisymmetric black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we have explored a scalar field cosmological model in the axially symmetric Bianchi type-I universe. In this study, our aim is to constrain the scalar field dark energy model in an anisotropic background. For this purpose, the explicit solution of the developed field equations for the model is determined and analysed. Constraints on the cosmological model parameters are established utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and using the latest observational data sets of OHD, BAO, and Pantheon. For the combined dataset (OHD, BAO, and Pantheon), the best-fit values of Hubble and density parameters are estimated as $ H_{0} = 71.54\pm 0.28$, $\Omega_{m0}=0.2622\pm0.0021$ $\Omega_{\phi0} = 0.7331\pm0.0046$, and $\Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.000162\pm0.000063$. The model shows a flipping nature and redshift transition occurs at $z_{t} = 0.6964^{+0.0136}_{-0.0006}$, and the present value of decelerated parameter is computed to be $q_{0} = -0.6964\pm0.028$ for the combined dataset. We have explored characteristics like the universe's age, particle horizon, deceleration parameter, and jerk parameter. The dynamical properties such as energy density $\rho_{\phi}$, scalar field pressure $p_{\phi}$, and equation of state parameter $\omega_{\phi}$ are analyzed and presented. We have also described the behavior of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ and scalar fields. Furthermore, the authors also described the behavior of energy conditions in scalar-tensor cosmology. The scenario of the present accelerated expansion of the universe is described by the contribution of the scalar field.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-Induced Quadrupole Moments in Precessing Compact Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-induced quadrupole moments provide an important characterization of compact objects, such as black holes, neutron stars and black hole mimickers inspired by additional fields and/or modified theories of gravity. Black holes in general relativity have a specific spin-induced quadrupole moment, with other objects potentially having differing values. Different values of this quadrupole moment lead to modifications of the spin precession dynamics, and consequently modifications to the inspiral waveform. Based on the spin-dynamics and the associated precessing waveform developed in our previous work, we assess the prospects of measuring spin-induced moments in various black hole, neutron star, and black-hole mimicker binaries. We focus on binaries in which at least one of the objects is in the mass gap (similar to the $2.6 M_\odot$ object found in GW190814). We find that for generic precessing binaries, the effect of the spin-induced quadrupole moments on the precession is sensitive to the nature of the mass-gap object, i.e., whether it is a light black hole or a massive neutron star. So that this is a good probe of the nature of these objects. For precessing black-hole mimicker binaries, this waveform also provides significantly tighter constraints on their spin-induced quadrupole moments than the previous results obtained without incorporating the precession effects of spin-induced quadrupole moments. We apply the waveform to sample events in GWTC catalogs to obtain better constraints on the spin-induced quadrupole moments, and discuss the measurement prospects for events in the O$4$ run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

Abstract: We study no-hair properties of static black holes in four and higher dimensional spacetimes with a cosmological constant. For the vanishing cosmological constant case, we show a no-hair theorem and also a no-short-hair theorem under certain conditions for the energy-momentum of matter fields. For the positive cosmological constant case, we discuss conditions for hairy static black holes to exist in terms of the energy density of matter fields evaluated at the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon. For the negative cosmological constant case, we study conditions for hairy black holes by presenting a no-hair theorem in which the asymptotic structure is assumed to be determined by the true cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We revise the dynamics of interacting vector-like dark energy, a theoretical framework proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. By investigating the interaction between vector-like dark energy and dark matter, we analyze its effects on the cosmic expansion history and the thermodynamics of the accelerating universe. Our results demonstrate that the presence of interaction significantly influences the evolution of vector-like dark energy, leading to distinct features in its equation of state and energy density. We compare our findings with observational data and highlight the importance of considering interactions in future cosmological studies.</description>

Based on generalized exact solutions of the equations of cosmological dynamics, the type of scalar-torsion gravity was reconstructed. Also, based on observational constraints on the values of the parameters of cosmological perturbations, the type of the coupling function was determined. It was noted that any models of cosmological inflation obtained on the basis of the proposed approach can be verified by observational constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational memory effects are predictions of general relativity that are characterized by an observable effect that persists after the passage of gravitational waves. In recent years, they have garnered particular interest, both due to their connection to asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems and because their observation would serve as a unique test of the nonlinear nature of general relativity. Apart from the more commonly known displacement and spin memories, however, there are other memory effects predicted by Einstein's equations that are associated with more subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the Bondi-Sachs metric. In this paper, we write explicit expressions for these higher memory effects in terms of their charge and flux contributions. Further, by using a numerical relativity simulation of a binary black hole merger, we compute the magnitude and morphology of these terms and compare them to those of the displacement and spin memory. We find that, although these terms are interesting from a theoretical perspective, due to their small magnitude they will be particularly challenging to observe with current and future detectors.</description>

      <title>Persistent gravitational wave observables: Nonlinearities in (non-)geodesic deviation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual gravitational wave memory effect can be understood as a change in the separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of gravitational waves. Over the past few decades, a wide variety of other, "persistent" observables which measure permanent effects on idealized detectors have been introduced, each probing distinct physical effects. These observables can be defined in (regions of) any spacetime where there exists a notion of radiation, such as perturbation theory off of a fixed background, nonlinear plane wave spacetimes, or asymptotically flat spacetimes. Many of the persistent observables defined in the literature have been considered only in asymptotically flat spacetimes, and the perturbative nature of such calculations has occasionally obscured deeper relationships between these observables that hold more generally. The goal of this paper is to show how these more general results arise, and to do so we focus on two observables related to the separation between two, potentially accelerated observers. The first is the curve deviation, which is a natural generalization of the displacement memory, and also contains what this paper proposes to call drift memory (previously called "subleading displacement memory") and ballistic memory. The second is a relative proper time shift that arises between the two observers, either at second order in their initial separation and relative velocity, or in the presence of relative acceleration. The results of this paper are, where appropriate, entirely non-perturbative in the curvature of spacetime, and so could be used beyond leading order in asymptotically flat spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Kerr Memory Effect at Null Infinity</title>

Abstract: We compute the memory effect due to a gravitational wave striking a Kerr black hole as seen by an observer at null infinity. This is done by working in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. It was shown by Hawking, Perry, and Strominger (HPS) that the memory effect due to a gravitational shockwave is seen as a pure BMS supertranslation from null infinity. Hence, it is of interest to compute the supertranslated Kerr solution in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. Finally, the gravitational wave is said to implant soft supertranslation hair on the event horizon of the black hole which carries superrotation charge. We will explicitly calculate the change in superrotation charge on the event horizon due to the supertranslation hair.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the matching of black hole tidal responses: a systematic study of relativistic and logarithmic corrections</title>

Abstract: The worldline effective field theory (EFT) gives a gauge-invariant definition of black hole conservative tidal responses (Love numbers), dissipation numbers, and their spin-0 and spin-1 analogs. In the first part of this paper we show how the EFT allows us to circumvent the source/response ambiguity without having to use the analytic continuation prescription. The source/response ambiguity appears if Post-Newtonian (PN)corrections to external sources overlap with the response. However, these PN corrections can be clearly identified and isolated using the EFT. We illustrate that by computing static one-point functions of various external fields perturbing the four-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry. Upon resumming all relevant Feynman diagrams, we find that the PN terms that may mimic the response actually vanish for static black holes. Thus, the extraction of Love numbers from matching the EFT and general relativity (GR) calculations is completely unambiguous, and it implies that the Love numbers vanish identically for all types of perturbations. We also study in detail another type of fine tuning in the EFT, the absence of Love numbers' running. We show that logarithmic corrections to Love numbers do stem from individual loop diagrams in generic gauges, but cancel after all diagrams are summed over. In the particular cases of spin-0 and spin-2 fields the logarithms are completely absent if one uses the Kaluza-Klein metric decomposition. In the second part of the paper we compute frequency-dependent dissipative response contributions to the one-point functions using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We extract black hole dissipation numbers by comparing the one-point functions in the EFT and GR. Our results are in perfect agreement with those obtained from a manifestly gauge-invariant matching of absorption cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Review of the No-Boundary Wave Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the universe is treated as a quantum system, it is described by a wave function. This wave function is a function not only of the matter fields, but also of spacetime. The no-boundary proposal is the idea that the wave function should be calculated by summing over geometries that have no boundary to the past, and over regular matter configurations on these geometries. Accordingly, the universe is finite, self-contained and the big bang singularity is avoided. Moreover, given a dynamical theory, the no-boundary proposal provides probabilities for various solutions of the theory. In this sense it provides a quantum theory of initial conditions.
  This review starts with a general overview of the framework of quantum cosmology, describing both the canonical and path integral approaches, and their interpretations. After recalling several heuristic motivations for the no-boundary proposal, its consequences are illustrated with simple examples, mainly in the context of cosmic inflation. We review how to include perturbations, assess the classicality of spacetime and how probabilities may be derived. A special emphasis is given to explicit implementations in minisuperspace, to observational consequences, and to the relationship of the no-boundary wave function with string theory. At each stage, the required analytic and numerical techniques are explained in detail, including the Picard-Lefschetz approach to oscillating integrals.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Kerr Black Holes from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We match scattering amplitudes in point particle effective field theory (EFT) and general relativity to extract low frequency dynamical tidal responses of rotating (Kerr) black holes to all orders in spin. In the conservative sector, we study local worldline couplings that correspond to the time-derivative expansion of the black hole tidal response function. These are dynamical (frequency-dependent) generalizations of the static Love numbers. We identify and extract couplings of three types of subleading local worldline operators: the curvature time derivative terms, the spin - curvature time derivative couplings, and quadrupole - octupole mixing operators that arise due to the violation of spherical symmetry. The first two subleading couplings are non-zero and exhibit a classical renormalization group running; we explicitly present their scheme-independent beta functions. The conservative mixing terms, however, vanish as a consequence of vanishing static Love numbers. In the non-conservative sector, we match the dissipation numbers at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to leading orders in frequency. In passing, we identify terms in the general relativity absorption probabilities that originate from tails and short-scale logarithmic corrections to the lowest order dissipation contributions.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Invariance Violation Limits from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been long conjectured that a signature of Quantum Gravity will be Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) that could be observed at energies much lower than the Planck scale. One possible signature of LIV is an energy-dependent speed of photons. This can be tested with a distant transient source of very high-energy photons. We explore time-of-flight limits on LIV derived from LHAASO's observations of tens of thousands of TeV photons from GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time. For a linear ($n=1$) dependence of the photon velocity on energy, we find a lower limit on the subluminal (superluminal) LIV scale of ${5.9} (6.2) mpl$. These are comparable to the stringent limits obtained so far and, as an independent bound obtained from a different redshift, confirm their robustness. For a quadratic model ($n=2$, corresponding to $d=6$ SME operators), the limits, which are currently the best available with the time-of-flight method, are $5.8 (4.6) \times 10^{-8} mpl$. Our analysis uses the publicly available LHAASO data, which is only in the $0.2-7$ TeV range. Higher energy data would enable us to improve these limits by a factor of 3 for $n=1$ and by an order of magnitude for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Amplitudes from Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carrollian holography is supposed to describe gravity in four-dimensional asymptotically flat space-time by the three-dimensional Carrollian CFT living at null infinity. We transform superstring scattering amplitudes into the correlation functions of primary fields of Carrollian CFT depending on the three-dimensional coordinates of the celestial sphere and a retarded time coordinate. The power series in the inverse string tension is converted to a whole tower of both UV and IR finite descendants of the underlying field-theoretical Carrollian amplitude. We focus on four-point amplitudes involving gauge bosons and gravitons in type I open superstring theory and in closed heterotic superstring theory at the tree-level. We also discuss the limit of infinite retarded time coordinates, where the string world-sheet becomes celestial.</description>
