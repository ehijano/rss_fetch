      <title>Ideals of \'etale groupoid algebras with coefficients in a sheaf with applications to topological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Effros-Hahn conjecture for groupoid algebras with coefficients in a sheaf, obtaining as a consequence a description of the ideals in skew inverse semigroup rings. We also use the description of the ideals to characterize when the groupoid algebras with coefficients in a sheaf are von Neumann regular, primitive, semiprimitive, or simple. We apply our results to the topological dynamics of actions of inverse semigroups, describing the existence of dense orbits and minimality in terms of primitivity and simplicity, respectively, of the associated algebra. Moreover, we apply our results to the usual complex groupoid algebra of continuous functions with compact support, used to build the C*-algebra associated with a groupoid, and describe criteria for its simplicity.</description>

      <title>A Note on Centralizers and Twisted Centralizers in Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates centralizers and twisted centralizers in degenerate and non-degenerate Clifford (geometric) algebras. We provide an explicit form of the centralizers and twisted centralizers of the subspaces of fixed grades, subspaces determined by the grade involution and the reversion, and their direct sums. The results can be useful for applications of Clifford algebras in computer science, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Minimal semiinjective resolutions in the $Q$-shaped derived category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Injective resolutions of modules are key objects of homological algebra, which are used for the computation of derived functors. Semiinjective resolutions of chain complexes are more general objects, which are used for the computation of $\operatorname{Hom}$ spaces in the derived category $\mathscr{D}( A )$ of a ring $A$. Minimal semiinjective resolutions have the additional property of being unique.
  The $Q$-shaped derived category $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$ consists of $Q$-shaped diagrams for a suitable preadditive category $Q$, and it generalises $\mathscr{D}( A )$. Some special cases of $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$ are the derived categories of differential modules, $m$-periodic chain complexes, and $N$-complexes, and there are many other possibilities. The category $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$ shares some key properties of $\mathscr{D}( A )$; for instance, it is triangulated and compactly generated.
  This paper establishes a theory of minimal semiinjective resolutions in $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$. As a sample application, it generalises a theorem by Ringel--Zhang on differential modules.</description>

      <title>Reflections on the Larson-Sweedler theorem for (weak) multiplier Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an algebra with identity and $\Delta:A\to A\otimes A$ a coproduct that admits a counit. If there exist a faithful left integral and a faithful right integral, one can construct an antipode and $(A,\Delta)$ is a Hopf algebra. This is the Larson-Sweedler theorem. There are generalizations of this result for multiplier Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras and weak multiplier Hopf algebras. In the case of a multiplier Hopf algebra, the existence of a counit can be weakened and can be replaced by the requirement that the coproduct is full. A similar result is true for weak multiplier Hopf algebras. What we show in this note is that in fact the result for multiplier Hopf algebras can still be obtained without the condition of fullness of the coproduct. As it turns out, this property will already follow from the other conditions. Consequently, also in the original theorem for Hopf algebras, the existence of a counit is a consequence of the other conditions. This slightly generalizes the original result. The situation for weak multiplier Hopf algebras seems to be more subtle. We discuss the problems and see what is still possible here. We consider these results in connection with the development of the theory of locally compact quantum groups. This is discussed in an appendix.</description>

      <title>Representations of $\mathbb{N}^{\infty}$-type combinatorial categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider representations of certain combinatorial categories, including the poset $\D$ of positive integers and division, the Young lattice $\mathscr{Y}$ of partitions of finite sets, the opposite category of the orbit category $\mathscr{Z}$ of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ with respect to nontrivial subgroups, and the category $\mathscr{CI}$ of finite cyclic groups and injective homomorphisms. We describe explicit upper bounds for homological degrees of their representations, and deduce that finitely presented representations (resp., representations presented in finite degrees) over a field form abelian subcategories of the representation categories. We also give an explicit description for the category of sheaves over the ringed atomic site $(\mathscr{Z}, \, J_{at}, \, \underline{\mathbb{C}})$, and show that irreducible sheaves are parameterized by primitive roots of the unit.</description>

      <title>Hilbert spaces over $C^*$-tensor categories, Fredholm modules and cyclic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Fredholm modules over an algebra taking values in generalized Hilbert spaces over a rigid $C^*$-tensor category. Using methods of Connes, we obtain Chern characters taking values in cyclic cohomology. These Chern characters are well behaved with respect to the periodicity operator, and depend only on the homotopy class of the Fredholm module.</description>

      <title>The contravariant functoriality of graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unions of directed graphs are the simplest examples of pushouts of directed graphs. The conditions under which they contravariantly induce surjective gauge-equivariant pullbacks of graph C*-algebras have been well studied and vastly instantiated in noncommutative topology (e.g., quantum balls and spheres). Herein, we go beyond the unions of graphs to systematically determine optimal conditions for more general pushouts of graphs under which they contravariantly induce graded pullbacks of path algebras, Leavitt path algebras, and graph C*-algebras. Our pullbacks are surjective only on one side, as dictated by natural examples and K-theory. The proposed new approach enlarges the scope of applications from admissible subgraphs (also called quotient graphs) to generalizations of unlabeled foldings of Stallings, collapsing the line graphs of graphs to initial graphs, and shrinking loops (or cycles).</description>

      <title>Flipped non-associative polynomial rings and the Cayley-Dickson construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study flipped non-associative polynomial rings. In particular, we show that all Cayley-Dickson algebras naturally appear as quotients of a certain type of such rings; this extends the classical construction of the complex numbers (and quaternions) as a quotient of a (skew) polynomial ring to the octonions, and beyond. We also extend some classical results on algebraic properties of Cayley-Dickson algebras by McCrimmon to a class of flipped non-associative polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>Solid lines in axial algebras of Jordan type $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a primitive axial algebra of Jordan type $\eta = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a Jordan algebra if and only if every $2$-generated subalgebra is \emph{solid}, a notion introduced recently by Ilya Gorshkov, Sergey Shpectorov and Alexei Staroletov.
  As a byproduct, we show that a subalgebra generated by axes $a,b$ is solid if and only if the associator $[L_a,L_b]$ is a derivation. Moreover, we show that $2$-generated subalgebras that are not solid contain precisely $3$ axes.</description>

      <title>The coproduct for the affine Yangian and the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Odd Periodic derived Hall algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $m$ be an odd positive integer and $D_m(\mathcal {A})$ be the $m$-periodic derived category of a finitary hereditary abelian category $\mathcal {A}$. In this note, we prove that there is an embedding of algebras from the derived Hall algebra of $D_m(\mathcal {A})$ defined by Xu-Chen [13] to the extended derived Hall algebra of $D_m(\mathcal {A})$ defined in [16]. This homomorphism is given on basis elements, rather than just on generating elements.</description>
