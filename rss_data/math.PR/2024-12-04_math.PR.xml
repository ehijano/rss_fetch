      <title>Exciting games and Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a competition between $d+1$ players, and aim to identify the "most exciting game'' of this kind. This is translated, mathematically, into a stochastic optimization problem over martingales that live on the $d$-dimensional subprobability simplex $\Delta$ and terminate on the vertices of $\Delta$ (so-called win-martingales), with a cost function related to a scaling limit of Shannon entropies. We uncover a surprising connection between this problem and the seemingly unrelated field of Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations: If $g$ solves \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} g(x)=\log \det\left(\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 g(x)\right), \quad \, \ \ \ \ \, \, \, \, x \in \Delta, \\ g(x)=\infty, \quad \quad \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \quad \quad \, \ \ \ \ \ x\in \partial \Delta, \end{cases} \end{equation*} then the winning-probability of the players in the most exciting game is described by $$dM_s=\sqrt{\frac{2 (\nabla^2 g(M_s))^{-1}}{1-s} } \, dB_s.$$ To formalize this, a detailed quantitative analysis of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for $g$ is crucial. This is then leveraged to prove that $M$ is indeed an optimal win-martingale.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Distribution of Random Graphs with Given Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study random graphs with a given degree sequence $d_1, d_2, \cdots, d_n$ from the configuration model. We show that under mild assumptions of the degree sequence, the spectral distribution of the normalized Laplacian matrix of such random graph converges in distribution to the semicircle distribution as the number of vertices $n\rightarrow \infty$. This extends work by McKay (1981) and Tran, Vu and Wang (2013) which studied random regular graphs ($d_1=d_2=\cdots=d_n=d$). Furthermore, we extend the assumption to show that a slightly more general condition is equivalent to the weak convergence to semicircle distribution. The equivalence is also illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A functional central limit theorem for weighted occupancy processes of Karlin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A functional central limit theorem is established for weighted occupancy processes of the Karlin model. The weighted occupancy processes take the form of, with $D_{n,j}$ denoting the number of urns with $j$-balls after first $n$ samplings, $\sum_{j=1}^na_jD_{n,j}$ for a prescribed sequence of real numbers $(a_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}$. The main applications are limit theorems for random permutations induced by Chinese restaurant processes with $(\alpha,\theta)$-seating with $\alpha\in(0,1), \theta&gt;-\alpha$. An example is briefly mentioned here, and full details are provided in an accompanying paper.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for random permutations induced by Chinese restaurant processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the random permutation matrices induced by the Chinese restaurant processes with $(\alpha,\theta)$-seating. When $\alpha=0,\theta&gt;0$, the permutations are those following Ewens measures on symmetric groups, and have been extensively studied in the literature. Here, we consider $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$. In an accompanying paper, a functional central limit theorem is established for partial sum of weighted cycle counts in the form of $\sum_{j=1}^n a_jC_{n,j}$, where $C_{n,j}$ is the number of $j$-cycles of the permutation matrix of size $n$. Two applications are presented. One is on linear statistics of the spectrum, and the other is on the characteristic polynomials outside the unit circle.</description>

      <title>On the curvatures of random complex submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any integers $n\geq 2$ and $1\leq r\leq n-1$ satisfying $3r\geq 2n-1$, we show that the expected volume fraction of a random degree $d$ complex submanifold of $\C\mathbb{P}^n$ of codimension $r$  where the bisectional holomorphic curvature (for the induced ambient metric) is negative tends to one when $d$ goes to infinity. Here, the probability measure is the natural one associated with the Fubini--Study metric. We provide similar estimates for the holomorphic sectional curvature, the Ricci curvature, and the scalar curvature. Our results hold more generally for random submanifolds within any complex projective manifold.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of first passage percolation geodesics on planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the scaling limit of the geodesics to the root for the first passage percolation distance on random planar maps. We first describe the scaling limit of the number of faces along the geodesics. This result enables to compare the metric balls for the first passage percolation and the dual graph distance. It also enables to upperbound the diameter of large random maps. Then, we describe the scaling limit of the tree of first passage percolation geodesics to the root via a stochastic coalescing flow of pure jump diffusions. This stochastic flow also enables us to construct some random metric spaces which we conjecture to be the scaling limit of random planar maps with high degrees. The main tool in this work is a time-reversal of the uniform peeling exploration.</description>

      <title>Schauder Estimates for Germs by Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this expository note, we show that the blow-up arguments of L. Simon adapt well to the corresponding Schauder theory of germs used in the study of singular SPDEs. We illustrate this through some representative examples. As in the classical PDE framework, the argument relies only on the scaling properties of the germ semi-norms and the Liouville principle for the operator.</description>

      <title>Selective Reviews of Bandit Problems in AI via a Statistical View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. We also extend the discussion to $K$-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, examining their methodologies, regret analyses, and discussing the relation between the SCAB problems and the functional data analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Tensorial free convolution, semicircular, free Poisson and R-transform in high order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work builds on our previous developments regarding a notion of freeness for tensors. We aim to establish a tensorial free convolution for compactly supported measures. First, we define higher-order analogues of the semicircular (or Wigner) law and the free Poisson (or Marcenko-Pastur) law, giving their moments and free cumulants. We prove the convergence of a Wishart-type tensor to the free Poisson law and recall the convergence of a Wigner tensor to the semicircular law. We also present a free Central Limit Theorem in this context. Next, we introduce a tensorial free convolution, define the $R$-transform, and provide the first examples of free convolution of measures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Graph Matching for Correlated Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learning problems on correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Our main result gives the first efficient algorithm for graph matching in this setting. In the most interesting regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high probability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 &gt; \alpha \approx 0.338$, where $\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant. Moreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching whenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an open problem of R\'acz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes the recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based on centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A major technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional estimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in relevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly recovered from a single graph. As an application of our results, we give an efficient algorithm for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs in parameter regimes where it is information-theoretically impossible to do so using just a single graph.</description>

      <title>The constant coefficient in precise Laplace asymptotics for gPAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article resumes the analysis of precise Laplace asymptotics for the generalised Parabolic Anderson Model (gPAM) initiated by Peter Friz and the author. More precisely, we provide an explicit formula for the constant coefficient in the asymptotic expansion in terms of traces and Carleman-Fredholm determinants of certain explicit operators. The proof combines classical Gaussian analysis in abstract Wiener spaces with arguments from the theory of regularity structures. As an ingredient, we prove that the minimiser in the (extended) phase functional of gPAM has better than just Cameron-Martin regularity.</description>

      <title>Color-avoiding percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced model of color-avoiding percolation defined as follows. Every edge in a graph $G$ is colored in some of $k\ge 2$ colors. Two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ are said to be CA-connected if $u$ and $v$ may be connected using any subset of $k-1$ colors. CA-connectivity defines an equivalence relation on the vertex set of $G$ whose classes are called CA-components.
  We study the component structure of a randomly colored Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph of constant average degree. We distinguish three regimes for the size of the largest component: a supercritical regime, a so-called intermediate regime, and a subcritical regime, in which the largest CA-component has respectively linear, logarithmic, and bounded size. Interestingly, in the subcritical regime, the bound is deterministic and given by the number of colors.</description>

      <title>Fox-H densities and completely monotone generalized Wright functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their flexibility, Fox-$H$ functions are widely studied and applied to many research topics, such as astrophysics, mechanical statistic, probability, etc. Well-known special cases of Fox-$H$ functions, such as Mittag-Leffler and Wright functions, find a wide application in the theory of stochastic processes, anomalous diffusions and non-Gaussian analysis. In this paper, we focus on certain explicit assumptions that allow us to use the Fox-$H$ functions as densities. We then provide a subfamily of the latter, called Fox-$H$ densities with all moments finite, and give their Laplace transforms as entire generalized Wright functions. The class of random variables with these densities is proven to possess a monoid structure. We present eight subclasses of special cases of such densities (together with their Laplace transforms) that are particularly relevant in applications, thanks to their probabilistic interpretation. To analyze the existence conditions of Fox-$H$ functions red as well as their sign, we derive asymptotic results and their analytic extension.</description>

      <title>From Market Saturation to Social Reinforcement: Understanding the Impact of Non-Linearity in Information Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion of information in networks is at the core of many problems in AI. Common examples include the spread of ideas and rumors as well as marketing campaigns. Typically, information diffuses at a non-linear rate, for example, if markets become saturated or if users of social networks reinforce each other's opinions. Despite these characteristics, this area has seen little research, compared to the vast amount of results for linear models, which exhibit less complex dynamics. Especially, when considering the possibility of re-infection, no fully rigorous guarantees exist so far.
  We address this shortcoming by studying a very general non-linear diffusion model that captures saturation as well as reinforcement. More precisely, we consider a variant of the SIS model in which vertices get infected at a rate that scales polynomially in the number of their infected neighbors, weighted by an infection coefficient $\lambda$. We give the first fully rigorous results for thresholds of $\lambda$ at which the expected survival time becomes super-polynomial. For cliques we show that when the infection rate scales sub-linearly, the threshold only shifts by a poly-logarithmic factor, compared to the standard SIS model. In contrast, super-linear scaling changes the process considerably and shifts the threshold by a polynomial term. For stars, sub-linear and super-linear scaling behave similar and both shift the threshold by a polynomial factor. Our bounds are almost tight, as they are only apart by at most a poly-logarithmic factor from the lower thresholds, at which the expected survival time is logarithmic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10513v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of height functions in asymmetric simple exclusion processes with drift that depends on the local particle configuration. We do so in the entire "sub-critical phase" (with respect to the drift speed). To our knowledge, it is a first such result for a class of particle systems without duality or explicit invariant measures. The tools developed in this paper consist of estimates on the corresponding Kolmogorov equations, giving a more robust proof of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. These tools are not exclusive to KPZ.</description>

      <title>The largest fragment in self-similar fragmentation processes of positive index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Take a self-similar fragmentation process with dislocation measure $\nu$ and index of self-similarity $\alpha &gt; 0$. Let $e^{-m_t}$ denote the size of the largest fragment in the system at time $t\geq 0$. We prove fine results for the asymptotics of the stochastic process $(m_t)_{t \geq 0}$ for a broad class of dislocation measures satisfying $$\nu(1-s_1 &gt; \delta ) = \delta^{-\theta} \ell(1/\delta),$$ for some $\theta \in (0,1)$ and $\ell:(0,\infty) \to (0,\infty)$ slowly varying at infinity. Under this regularity condition, we find that if for $t \geq 0$ we have the almost-sure convergence $\lim_{t \to \infty} (m_t - g(t)) = 0$, where $$ g(t) :=\left( \log t - (1-\theta) \log \log t +f(t) \right)/\alpha$$ and $f(t) = o(\log \log t)$ can be given explicitly in terms of $\alpha,\theta$ and $\ell(\cdot)$. We prove a similar result in the finite activity case, which corresponds roughly speaking to the setting $\theta = 0$. Our results sharpen significantly the best prior result on general self-similar fragmentation processes, due to Bertoin, which states that $m_t = (1+o(1)) \log (t)/\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Cournot's principle revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cournot's principle states that a typical event (i.e., an event with probability very close to $1$) occurs nearly certainly in a single trial of an experiment. This principle has been considered by various authors as the only connection between mathematical probability and the real world of experiments.
  To make its logical structure clearer, in this paper a reformulation of Cournot's principle is proposed, the main novelty of which this is the explicit introduction of $\textit{practical certainty}$ as an objective empirical property of some events. The novel formulation then states that a probability measure $P$ $\textit{governs}$ an experiment $E$ if the events that are typical according to $P$ are practically certain according to $E$, and this property is also required to hold for the $n$-fold product of $P$ and for the experiment consisting of $n$ independent trials of $E$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
  The proposed reformulation highlights the possibility that two different probability measures govern the same experiment. However, this possibility is excluded by a theorem proven in the paper.</description>

      <title>Optimal Linear Sofic Approximations Of Countable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable group G is called k-linear sofic (for some 0 &lt;k \le 1) if finite subsets of G admit "approximate representations" by complex invertible matrices in the normalized rank metric, so that non-identity elements are k-away from the identity. This class of groups was systematically studied by Arzhantseva and Paunescu [AP17], where it is shown that such a group is always 1/4-linear sofic. In this paper, we will study the optimality of this result for general countable groups and show that every linear sofic group is 1/2-linear sofic, and 1/2 cannot be improved. However, if G is assumed to be torsion-free, then it is 1-linear sofic. These results answer a question posed by G. Arzhantseva in her talk in the IAS Stability and Testability lecture series. We also study the optimal linear sofic constant of finite groups over C and fields of positive characteristic. For the proof, we establish effective non-concentration estimates for random walks on finitely generated abelian groups, which may be of independent interest. Another ingredient of the proof involves bounding integrals of certain trigonometric sums.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Trek Rule for the Lyapunov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lyapunov equation is a linear matrix equation characterizing the cross-sectional steady-state covariance matrix of a Gaussian Markov process. We show a new version of the trek rule for this equation, which links the graphical structure of the drift of the process to the entries of the steady-state covariance matrix. In general, the trek rule is a power series expansion of the covariance matrix, though for acyclic models it simplifies to a polynomial in the off-diagonal entries of the drift matrix. Using the trek rule we can give relatively explicit formulas for the entries of the covariance matrix for some special cases of the drift matrix. These results illustrate notable differences between covariance models entailed by the Lyapunov equation and those entailed by linear additive noise models. To further explore differences and similarities between these two model classes, we use the trek rule to derive a new lower bound for the marginal variances in the acyclic case. This sheds light on the phenomenon, well known for the linear additive noise model, that the variances in the acyclic case tend to increase along a topological ordering of the variables.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime using the framework of Hairer's regularity structures theory. Assuming the model bounds our estimates imply global existence of solutions and existence of an invariant measure. We extend the method developed for the usual heat operator by Chandra, Moinat and Weber [CMW23] to the fractional heat operator, thereby treating a more physically relevant model. A key ingredient in this work is the development of localised multilevel Schauder estimates for the fractional heat operator which is not covered by Hairer's original work. Furthermore, the algebraic arguments from [CMW23] are streamlined significantly.</description>
