      <title>Discounting under inequality and lobbyists disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appropriate discount rate for evaluating policies is a critical consideration in economic decision-making. This paper presents a new model for calculating the derived discount rate for a society that includes different groups with varying desirable discount rates. The model takes into account equality in society and is designed to be used by social planners. The derived discount rate is a useful tool for examining the social planner's approach to policies related to the future of society. If the discount rate is determined correctly, it can help determine the amount of growth and equality in society, as well as the level of attention paid to long-term public projects. The model can be customized for different distributions of wealth and discount rates, allowing researchers to extract desired results. Analysis of the model shows that when equality in society is considered, the derived discount rate is lower than the result obtained using Hamilton's method. Social planners must consider that this may increase disagreement in more consuming groups of society at first.</description>

      <title>Full Implementation via Information Design in Nonatomic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the implementation of Bayes correlated equilibria in symmetric Bayesian nonatomic games, using direct information structures and obedient strategies. The main results demonstrate full implementation in a class of games with positive cost externalities. Specifically, if the game admits a strictly convex potential in every state, then for every Bayes correlated equilibrium outcome with finite support and rational action distributions, there exists a direct information structure that implements this outcome under all equilibria. When the potential is only weakly convex, we show that all equilibria implement the same expected social cost. Additionally, all Bayes correlated equilibria, including those with infinite support or irrational action distributions, are approximately implemented.</description>

      <title>Weak independence of irrelevant alternatives and generalized Nash bargaining solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Nash's (1950) seminal result, independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) plays a central role, but it has long been a subject of criticism in axiomatic bargaining theory. This paper examines the implication of a weak version of IIA in multi-valued bargaining solutions defined on non-convex bargaining problems. We show that if a solution satisfies weak IIA together with standard axioms, it can be represented, like the Nash solution, using weighted products of normalized utility levels. In this representation, the weight assigned to players for evaluating each agreement is determined endogenously through a two-stage optimization process. These solutions bridge the two dominant solution concepts, the Nash solution and the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution (Kalai and Smorodinsky, 1975). Furthermore, we consider special cases of these solutions in the context of bargaining over linear production technologies.</description>

      <title>Marginal Mechanisms For Balanced Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the balanced exchange of bundles of indivisible goods. We are interested in mechanisms that only rely on marginal preferences over individual objects even though agents' actual preferences compare bundles. Such mechanisms play an important role in two-sided matching but have not received much attention in exchange settings. We show that individually rational and Pareto-efficient marginal mechanisms exist if and only if no agent ever ranks any of her endowed objects lower than in her second indifference class. We call such marginal preferences trichotomous. In proving sufficiency, we define mechanisms, which are constrained versions of serial dictatorship, that achieve both desiderata based only agents' marginal preferences.
  We then turn to strategy-proofness. An individually rational, efficient and strategy-proof mechanism-marginal or not-exists if and only if each agent's marginal preference is not only trichotomous, but does not contain a non-endowed object in her second indifference class. We call such marginal preferences strongly trichotomous. For such preferences, our mechanisms reduce to the class of strategy-proof mechanisms introduced in Manjunath and Westkamp (2018). For trichotomous preferences, while our variants of serial dictatorship are not strategy-proof, they are truncation-proof and not obviously manipulable (Troyan and Morrill, 2020).</description>

      <title>Experiments in the Linear Convex Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two rankings of statistical experiments based on the linear convex order, providing simpler and more tractable characterizations than Blackwell order, which relies on the convex order. We apply these rankings to compare statistical experiments in decision problems with a binary-action space and in decision problems that aggregate payoffs over a collection of binary-action decision problems. Furthermore, these rankings can be used to compare statistical experiments in moral hazard problems without requiring the first-order approach to be valid, thereby complementing the results in Holmstr\"om (1979) and Kim (1995).</description>

      <title>How Humans Help LLMs: Assessing and Incentivizing Human Preference Annotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-annotated preference data play an important role in aligning large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we investigate the questions of assessing the performance of human annotators and incentivizing them to provide high-quality annotations. The quality assessment of language/text annotation faces two challenges: (i) the intrinsic heterogeneity among annotators, which prevents the classic methods that assume the underlying existence of a true label; and (ii) the unclear relationship between the annotation quality and the performance of downstream tasks, which excludes the possibility of inferring the annotators' behavior based on the model performance trained from the annotation data. Then we formulate a principal-agent model to characterize the behaviors of and the interactions between the company and the human annotators. The model rationalizes a practical mechanism of a bonus scheme to incentivize annotators which benefits both parties and it underscores the importance of the joint presence of an assessment system and a proper contract scheme. From a technical perspective, our analysis extends the existing literature on the principal-agent model by considering a continuous action space for the agent. We show the gap between the first-best and the second-best solutions (under the continuous action space) is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log n})$ for the binary contracts and $\Theta(1/n)$ for the linear contracts, where $n$ is the number of samples used for performance assessment; this contrasts with the known result of $\exp(-\Theta(n))$ for the binary contracts when the action space is discrete. Throughout the paper, we use real preference annotation data to accompany our discussions.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Points of Fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work explores fusions, the multidimensional counterparts of mean-preserving contractions and their extreme and exposed points. We reveal an elegant geometric/combinatorial structure for these objects. Of particular note is the connection between Lipschitz-exposed points (measures that are unique optimizers of Lipschitz-continuous objectives) and power diagrams, which are divisions of a space into convex polyhedral ``cells'' according to a weighted proximity criterion. These objects are frequently seen in nature--in cell structures in biological systems, crystal and plant growth patterns, and territorial division in animal habitats--and, as we show, provide the essential structure of Lipschitz-exposed fusions. We apply our results to several questions concerning categorization.</description>

      <title>Diversification for infinite-mean Pareto models without risk aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic dominance between portfolios of independent and identically distributed (iid) extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) Pareto random variables. With the notion of majorization order, we show that a more diversified portfolio of iid extremely heavy-tailed Pareto random variables is larger in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result is further generalized for Pareto random variables caused by triggering events, random variables with tails being Pareto, bounded Pareto random variables, and positively dependent Pareto random variables. These results provide an important implication in investment: Diversification of extremely heavy-tailed Pareto profits uniformly increases investors' profitability, leading to a diversification benefit. Remarkably, different from the finite-mean setting, such a diversification benefit does not depend on the decision maker's risk aversion.</description>
