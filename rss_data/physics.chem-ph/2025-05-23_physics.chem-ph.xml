      <title>Vibrational Quantum States of Methanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methanol molecule is a sensitive probe of astrochemistry, astrophysics, and fundamental physics. The first-principles elucidation and prediction of its rotation-torsional-vibrational motions are enabled in this work by the computation of a full-dimensional, \emph{ab initio} potential energy surface (PES) and numerically exact quantum dynamics. An active-learning approach is used to sample explicitly correlated coupled-cluster electronic energies, and the datapoints are fitted with permutationally invariant polynomials to obtain a spectroscopic-quality PES representation. Variational vibrational energies and corresponding tunnelling splittings are computed up to the first overtone of the C-O stretching mode by direct numerical solution of the (ro)vibrational Schr\"odinger equation with optimal internal coordinates and efficient basis and grid truncation techniques. As a result, the computed vibrational band origins finally agree with experiment within $5\ \text{cm}^{-1}$, allowing for the exploration of the large-amplitude quantum mechanical motion and tunnelling splittings coupled with the small-amplitude vibrational dynamics. These developments open the route towards simulating rovibrational spectra used to probe methanol in outer space and in precision science laboratories, as well as for probing interactions with external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and selection rules in photoelectron chiral dichroism from tailored light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a method whereby randomly oriented chiral molecules are irradiated by circularly-polarized light, photoionizing electrons, which are measured in a momentum-resolved manner. This scheme permits chiral light-matter interactions within the electric-dipole approximation (avoiding weak magnetic-dipole interactions), yielding huge chiral signals in the form of a forwards-backwards asymmetry in photoemission. Recently, more intricate realizations of PECD have been explored where the circularly-polarized light is replaced with elaborate polarization-tailored light (e.g. bi-chromatic, non-collinear, etc.), some of which do not even require circularly-polarized components, but still lead to massive chiral signals. However, the connection between generalized symmetries and asymmetries of the laser drive and selection rules in PECD have not yet been derived. Here we formulate this connection analytically from group theory, also predicting two previously unknown selection rules for PECD from fields with dynamical inversion and improper-rotational symmetries. We further propose bi-chromatic bi-elliptical fields for breaking symmetries in typical spectra, yielding potentially more information for ultrafast-resolved measurements. We numerically demonstrate all of our results with state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations in the archetypal chiral molecule, Bromochlorofluoromethane, providing predictions for experiments. Our work presents a roadmap for analyzing PECD from tailored light and resolved a long-standing issue in the field. It should motivate theoretical and experimental investigations in novel PECD set-ups.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Direct Prediction of Molecular Dynamics Across Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of atomistic systems, but its reliance on sequential numerical integration limits simulation efficiency. We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the conventional ab initio MD. The model's flexible design supports diverse application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary conditions, and interaction types. By overcoming the intrinsic speed barrier of conventional MD, MDtrajNet-1 opens new frontiers in efficient and scalable atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Lineshapes in Pump-Probe Spectroscopy of Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forming new hybrid quasiparticles by strong light-matter coupling is a promising tool for tailoring photophysics and photochemistry of molecules. Thus, the ultrafast dynamics of polaritons formed upon strong light-matter coupling has been extensively studied by pump-probe spectroscopy. Although it was predicted that the partial photonic character of polaritons should shorten their lifetime compared to purely molecular excited states, many studies do not observe this effect. So far, the unexpected longevity of the spectral signatures was either explained by relaxation into a manifold of so-called dark states or by other uncontrolled effects that change the properties of cavity materials. In order to resolve these issues, we investigate here the dependence of the lineshape of pump-probe spectra of polaritons on the ratio of photonic and molecular character. Furthermore, by phenomenologically including relaxation to dark states, we find that it is possible to spectrally resolve this relaxation process by observing a characteristic phase flip in the pump-probe signal. Our results show that the signatures of various effects and their contributions to the polariton dynamics can be disentangled from the spectral lineshapes.</description>

      <title>NeuralTSNE: A Python Package for the Dimensionality Reduction of Molecular Dynamics Data Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning has recently gained much attention in the field of molecular dynamics (MD). Particularly, dimensionality reduction techniques have been regularly employed to analyze large volumes of high-dimensional MD data to gain insight into hidden information encoded in MD trajectories. Among many such techniques, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is particularly popular. A parametric version of t-SNE that employs neural networks is less commonly known, yet it has demonstrated superior performance in dimensionality reduction compared to the standard implementation. Here, we present a Python package called NeuralTSNE with our implementation of parametric t-SNE. The implementation is done using the PyTorch library and the PyTorch Lightning framework and can be imported as a module or used from the command line. We show that NeuralTSNE offers an easy-to-use tool for the analysis of MD data.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized alkali-metal trimers revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homonuclear spin-polarized alkali-metal trimers in their lowest-lying electronic state are investigated theoretically. Their equilibrium geometries and binding energies are determined with the state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods at three levels of approximation. The equilibrium geometries obtained $R_{\rm eq}({\rm Li}_3) = 3.100$ \r{A}, $R_{\rm eq}({\rm Na}_3) = 4.353$ \r{A}, $R_{\rm eq}({\rm K}_3) = 4.996$ \r{A}, $R_{\rm eq}({\rm Rb}_3) = 5.391$ \r{A}, and $R_{\rm eq}({\rm Cs}_3) = 5.730$ \r{A} are compared to the other theoretical results and also with the very recent experimental results obtained through the laser-induced Coulomb explosion. Further theoretical studies are proposed, which could help with better interpretation of the experimental results for the sodium and cesium trimers.</description>

      <title>Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Spin adaptation of the cumulant expansions of reduced density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for the spin adaptation of the cumulants of p-particle reduced density matrices (RDMs), with explicit constructions for p = 1 to 3. These spin-adapted cumulants enable rigorous treatment of both S_z and S^2 symmetries in quantum systems, providing a foundation for spin-resolved electronic structure methods. We show that complete spin adaptation -- referred to as complete S-representability -- can be enforced by constraining the variances of S_z and S^2, which require the 2-RDM and 4-RDM, respectively. Importantly, the cumulants of RDMs scale linearly with system size -- size-extensive -- making them a natural object for incorporating spin symmetries in scalable electronic structure theories. The developed formalism is applicable to density-based methods (DFT), one-particle RDM functional theories (RDMFT), and two-particle RDM methods. We further extend the approach to spin-orbit-coupled systems via total angular momentum adaptation. Beyond spin, the framework enables the adaptation of RDM theories to additional symmetries through the construction of suitable irreducible tensor operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling and high-density specific heat of simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original Rosenfeld-Tarazona (RT) scaling of the excess energy in simple dense fluids predicts a $\propto T^{3/5}$ thermal correction to the fluid Madelung energy. This implies that the excess isochoric heat capacity scales as $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-2/5}$. Careful examination performed in this paper demonstrates that the exponent $-2/5$ is not always optimal. For instance, in the Lennard-Jones fluid in some vicinity of the triple point, the exponent $-1/3$ turns out to be more appropriate. The analysis of the specific heat data in neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and liquid mercury reveals that no single value of the exponent exists, describing all the data simultaneously. Therefore we propose a generalized RT scaling in the form $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is a density- and material-dependent adjustable parameter. The question concerning which material properties and parameters affect the exponent $\alpha$ and whether it can be predicted from general physical arguments requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo for Electron-Photon Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid light-matter polaritonic states have shown great promise for altering already known and enabling novel chemical reactions and controlling photophysical phenomena. This field has recently become one of the most prominent and active areas of research that connects the communities of chemistry and quantum optics. The ab initio modeling of such polaritonic phenomena has led to updating commonly used electronic structure methods, such as Hartree-Fock, density functional, and coupled cluster theories, to explicitly include Bosonic degrees of freedom. In this work, we explore the quantum electrodynamic auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QED-AFQMC) method to accurately capture the polaritonic ground state of representative quantum chemical benchmark systems to explore electron-photon correlations. We analyze these correlations across multiple examples and benchmark the QED-AFQMC results against other ab initio quantum electrodynamics methods, including QED-coupled cluster and QED-full configuration interaction, demonstrating the method's accuracy and its potential for scalable simulations of strongly coupled light-matter systems.</description>

      <title>A finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model that accurately captures multicomponent ionic transport by incorporating key physical phenomena such as steric effects, solvation, and pressure coupling. The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD) is a proposed method for the resolution of molecular chirality, employing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. Going beyond the conventional assumptions about HD, this work proposes a rigid theoretical framework for the analysis of the HD, based on molecular symmetries and rotational eigenstates. We derive the rotational selection rules, which clearly establish that HD only emerges from the spin-orbit coupling of light, even for beams without far-field OAM. Our findings refine the conditions for observing HD, shedding light on the outcome of prior experiments and guiding future designs for chiral sensing using structured light.</description>

      <title>Silver Electrodeposition from Ag/AgCl Electrodes: Implications for Nanoscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of nanoscience, silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes have become widely utilised in microscale and nanoscale fluidic experiments, because of their stability. However, our findings reveal that the dissolution of AgCl from the electrode in \ch{Cl-}-rich solutions can lead to significant silver contamination, through the formation of silver complexes, \ch{[AgCl_{n+1}]^{n-}}. We demonstrate the electrodeposition of silver particles on graphene in KCl aqueous solution, with AgCl dissolution from the electrode as the sole source of silver. This unexpected electrodeposition process offers a more plausible interpretation of the recently reported ``ionic flow-induced current in graphene''. That is, the measured electronic current in graphene is due to the electrodeposition of silver, challenging the previously claimed ``ionic Coulomb drag''. More caution is called for when using Ag/AgCl electrodes in microfluidic, and especially nanofluidic systems, because AgCl dissolution should not be neglected.</description>

      <title>Improvement of H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for in-situ production of H$_2$O$_2$ is an attractive alternative to replace the methods based on anthraquinone oxidation. This study investigates the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$ in different molar proportions and its application as electrocatalysts in the ORR. One performed the characterization of the electrocatalysts using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the electrocatalysts were analyzed for the ORR and the Nb$_2$O$_5$ doped with 0.5% Ce showing the highest electrocatalytic response. This electrocatalyst was also employed as a gas diffusion electrode and exhibited more significant H$_2$O$_2$ production at all potentials than the Vulcan XC72 carbon modified solely with Nb$_2$O$_5$. At the applied potentials of -1.3 V and -1.9 V, it produced 105% and 86% more H$_2$O$_2$, respectively, than the Vulcan XC72 carbon modified only with Nb$_2$O$_5$. These results can be attributed to the doping of Nb$_2$O$_5$ with 0.5% Ce, which induces local distortions in the crystal lattice of Nb$_2$O$_5$ due to the difference in ionic radius between Nb$^{5+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$, which combined with increased hydrophilicity and wetting properties, may have facilitated electron transfer and O$_2$ transport, favoring the ORR.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stands as one of the foremost utilized oxidizing agents in modern times. The established method for its production involves the intricate and costly anthraquinone process. However, a promising alternative pathway is the electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production, accomplished through the oxygen reduction reaction via a 2-electron pathway. This method not only simplifies the production process but also upholds environmental sustainability, especially when compared to the conventional anthraquinone method. In this review paper, recent works from the literature focusing on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction promoted by carbon electrocatalysts are summarized. The practical applications of these materials in the treatment of effluents contaminated with different pollutants (drugs, dyes, pesticides, and herbicides) are presented. Water treatment aiming to address these issues can be achieved through advanced oxidation electrochemical processes such as electro-Fenton, solar-electro-Fenton, and photo-electro-Fenton. These processes are discussed in detail in this work and the possible radicals that degrade the pollutants in each case are highlighted. The review broadens its scope to encompass contemporary computational simulations focused on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction, employing different models to describe carbon-based electrocatalysts. Finally, perspectives and future challenges in the area of carbon-based electrocatalysts for H2O2 electrogeneration are discussed. This review paper presents a forward-oriented viewpoint of present innovations and pragmatic implementations, delineating forthcoming challenges and prospects of this ever-evolving field.</description>

      <title>WGFormer: An SE(3)-Transformer Driven by Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Molecular Ground-State Conformation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09795</link>

Abstract: Predicting molecular ground-state conformation (i.e., energy-minimized conformation) is crucial for many chemical applications such as molecular docking and property prediction. Classic energy-based simulation is time-consuming when solving this problem, while existing learning-based methods have advantages in computational efficiency but sacrifice accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method to bridge the energy-based simulation and the learning-based strategy, which designs and learns a Wasserstein gradient flow-driven SE(3)-Transformer, called WGFormer, for ground-state conformation prediction. Specifically, our method tackles this task within an auto-encoding framework, which encodes low-quality conformations by the proposed WGFormer and decodes corresponding ground-state conformations by an MLP. The architecture of WGFormer corresponds to Wasserstein gradient flows -- it optimizes conformations by minimizing an energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms, thereby significantly improving performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, providing a new and insightful paradigm to predict ground-state conformation.</description>
