      <title>Breaking Symmetries with Involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking for graphs and other combinatorial objects is notoriously hard. On the one hand, complete symmetry breaks are exponential in size. On the other hand, current, state-of-the-art, partial symmetry breaks are often considered too weak to be of practical use.
  Recently, the concept of graph patterns has been introduced and provides a concise representation for (large) sets of non-canonical graphs, i.e.\ graphs that are not lex-leaders and can be excluded from search. In particular, four (specific) graph patterns apply to identify about 3/4 of the set of all non-canonical graphs.
  Taking this approach further we discover that graph patterns that derive from permutations that are involutions play an important role in the construction of symmetry breaks for graphs.
  We take advantage of this to guide the construction of partial and complete symmetry breaking constraints based on graph patterns.
  The resulting constraints are small in size and strong in the number of symmetries they break.</description>

      <title>The Vampire Diary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the past decade of continuous development, the theorem prover Vampire has become an automated solver for the combined theories of commonly-used data structures. Vampire now supports arithmetic, induction, and higher-order logic. These advances have been made to meet the demands of software verification, enabling Vampire to effectively complement SAT/SMT solvers and aid proof assistants. We explain how best to use Vampire in practice and review the main changes Vampire has undergone since its last tool presentation, focusing on the engineering principles and design choices we made during this process.</description>

      <title>A framework for computing upper bounds in passive learning settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of inferring logical formulas from examples has garnered significant attention as a means to assist engineers in creating formal specifications used in the design, synthesis, and verification of computing systems. Among various approaches, enumeration algorithms have emerged as some of the most effective techniques for this task. These algorithms employ advanced strategies to systematically enumerate candidate formulas while minimizing redundancies by avoiding the generation of syntactically different but semantically equivalent formulas. However, a notable drawback is that these algorithms typically do not provide guarantees of termination, which poses challenges for their use in real-world applications.
  This paper develops an abstract framework to bound the size of possible solutions for a logic inference task, thereby providing a termination guarantee for enumeration algorithms through the introduction of a sufficient stopping criterion. The proposed framework is designed with flexibility in mind and is applicable to a broad spectrum of practically relevant logical formalisms, including Modal Logic, Linear Temporal Logic, Computation Tree Logic, Alternating-time Temporal Logic, and even selected inference task for finite automata. In addition, our approach enabled us to develop a new class of algorithms that enumerate over the semantics of formulas rather than their syntactic representations, offering new possibilities for reducing redundancy.</description>

      <title>Information Science Principles of Machine Learning: A Causal Chain Meta-Framework Based on Formalized Information Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Objective] This study focuses on addressing the current lack of a unified formal theoretical framework in machine learning, as well as the deficiencies in interpretability and ethical safety assurance. [Methods] A formal information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error. [Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This work overcomes the limitations of fragmented research and provides a unified theoretical foundation for systematically addressing the critical challenges currently faced in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Safety, Relative Tightness and the Probabilistic Frame Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic separation logic offers an approach to reasoning about imperative probabilistic programs in which a separating conjunction is used as a mechanism for expressing independence properties. Crucial to the effectiveness of the formalism is the frame rule, which enables modular reasoning about independent probabilistic state. We explore a semantic formulation of probabilistic separation logic, in which the frame rule has the same simple formulation as in separation logic, without further side conditions. This is achieved by building a notion of safety into specifications, using which we establish a crucial property of specifications, called relative tightness, from which the soundness of the frame rule follows.</description>
