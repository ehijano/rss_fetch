      <title>Utilizing AI and Social Media Analytics to Discover Adverse Side Effects of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adverse side effects (ASEs) of drugs, revealed after FDA approval, pose a threat to patient safety. To promptly detect overlooked ASEs, we developed a digital health methodology capable of analyzing massive public data from social media, published clinical research, manufacturers' reports, and ChatGPT. We uncovered ASEs associated with the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), a market expected to grow exponentially to $133.5 billion USD by 2030. Using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, our method successfully detected 21 potential ASEs overlooked upon FDA approval, including irritability and numbness. Our data-analytic approach revolutionizes the detection of unreported ASEs associated with newly deployed drugs, leveraging cutting-edge AI-driven social media analytics. It can increase the safety of new drugs in the marketplace by unlocking the power of social media to support regulators and manufacturers in the rapid discovery of hidden ASE risks.</description>

      <title>A drug classification pipeline for Medicaid claims using RxNorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Freely preprocess drug codes recorded in electronic health records and insurance claims to drug classes that may then be used in biomedical research.
  Materials and Methods: We developed a drug classification pipeline for linking National Drug Codes to the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. To implement our solution, we created an R package interface to the National Library of Medicine's RxNorm API.
  Results: Using the classification pipeline, 59.4% of all unique NDC were linked to an ATC, resulting in 95.5% of all claims being successfully linked to a drug classification. We identified 12,004 unique NDC codes that were classified as being an opioid or non-opioid prescription for treating pain.
  Discussion: Our proposed pipeline performed similarly well to other NDC classification routines using commercial databases. A check of a small, random sample of non-active NDC found the pipeline to be accurate for classifying these codes.
  Conclusion: The RxNorm NDC classification pipeline is a practical and reliable tool for categorizing drugs in large-scale administrative claims data.</description>

      <title>Detection of bromochloro alkanes in indoor dust using a novel CP-Seeker data integration tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bromochloro alkanes (BCAs) have been manufactured for use as flame retardants for decades and preliminary environmental risk screening suggests they are likely to behave similarly to polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), subclasses of which are restricted as Stockholm Convention Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). BCAs have rarely been studied in the environment, though some evidence suggests they may migrate from treated-consumer materials into indoor dust, resulting in human exposure via inadvertent ingestion. In this study, BCA-C14 mixture standards were synthesized and used to validate an analytical method. This method relies on chloride-enhanced liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-Orbitrap-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Orbitrap-HRMS) and a novel CP-Seeker integration software package for homologue detection and integration. Dust sample preparation via ultrasonic extraction, acidified silica clean-up and fractionation on neutral silica cartridges was found to be suitable for BCAs, with absolute recovery of individual homologues averaging 66 to 78% and coefficients of variation $\le$10% in replicated spiking experiments (n=3). In addition, a total of 59 indoor dust samples from six countries including Australia (n=10), Belgium (n=10), Colombia (n=10), Japan (n=10), Thailand (n=10) and the United States of America (n=9) were analysed for BCAs. BCAs were detected in seven samples from the USA, with carbon chain lengths of C8, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C24 to C28, C30 and C31 observed overall, though not detected in samples from any other countries. Bromination of detected homologues in the indoor dust samples ranged from Br1-4 as well as Br7, while chlorine numbers ranged from Cl2-11. BCA-C18 were the most frequently detected, observed in each of the USA samples, while the most prevalent halogenation degrees were homologues of Br2 and Cl4-5. Broad estimations of BCA concentrations in the dust samples indicated that levels may approach those of other flame retardants in at least some instances. These findings suggest that development of quantification strategies and further investigation of environmental occurrence and health implications are needed.</description>

      <title>Real-time Geoinformation Systems to Improve the Quality, Scalability, and Cost of Internet of Things for Agri-environment Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence to drive knowledge discovery in the agricultural sciences, spatial internet of things (IoT) technologies have become increasingly important for collecting real-time, high resolution data for these models. However, managing large fleets of devices while maintaining high data quality remains an ongoing challenge as scientists iterate from prototype to mature end-to-end applications. Here, we provide a set of case studies using the framework of technology readiness levels for an open source spatial IoT system. The spatial IoT systems underwent 3 major and 14 minor system versions, had over 2,727 devices manufactured both in academic and commercial contexts, and are either in active or planned deployment across four continents. Our results show the evolution of a generalizable, open source spatial IoT system designed for agricultural scientists, and provide a model for academic researchers to overcome the challenges that exist in going from one-off prototypes to thousands of internet-connected devices.</description>

      <title>Smoothing in linear multicompartment biological processes subject to stochastic input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical and biological systems rely on the progression of material through multiple independent stages. In viral replication, for example, virions enter a cell to undergo a complex process comprising several disparate stages before the eventual accumulation and release of replicated virions. While such systems may have some control over the internal dynamics that make up this progression, a challenge for many is to regulate behaviour under what are often highly variable external environments acting as system inputs. In this work, we study a simple analogue of this problem through a linear multicompartment model subject to a stochastic input in the form of a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a type of Gaussian process. By expressing the system as a multidimensional Gaussian process, we derive several closed-form analytical results relating to the covariances and autocorrelations of the system, quantifying the smoothing effect discrete compartments afford multicompartment systems. Semi-analytical results demonstrate that feedback and feedforward loops can enhance system robustness, and simulation results probe the intractable problem of the first passage time distribution, which has specific relevance to eventual cell lysis in the viral replication cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that the smoothing seen in the process is a consequence of the discreteness of the system, and does not manifest in system with continuous transport. While we make progress through analysis of a simple linear problem, many of our insights are applicable more generally, and our work enables future analysis into multicompartment processes subject to stochastic inputs.</description>

      <title>Pathspace Kalman Filters with Dynamic Process Uncertainty for Analyzing Time-course Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kalman Filter (KF) is an optimal linear state prediction algorithm, with applications in fields as diverse as engineering, economics, robotics, and space exploration. Here, we develop an extension of the KF, called a Pathspace Kalman Filter (PKF) which allows us to a) dynamically track the uncertainties associated with the underlying data and prior knowledge, and b) take as input an entire trajectory and an underlying mechanistic model, and using a Bayesian methodology quantify the different sources of uncertainty. An application of this algorithm is to automatically detect temporal windows where the internal mechanistic model deviates from the data in a time-dependent manner. First, we provide theorems characterizing the convergence of the PKF algorithm. Then, we numerically demonstrate that the PKF outperforms conventional KF methods on a synthetic dataset lowering the mean-squared-error by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we apply this method to biological time-course dataset involving over 1.8 million gene expression measurements.</description>
