      <title>Economic relativity: a cut rule for perimeter valuation in equity ownership networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Cut-Based Valuation (CBV), a unified framework for consolidated value in equity/flow networks. The central idea is that economic value is never absolute: it is always defined relative to an observer Omega, which fixes perimeter, measurement basis, units/FX/PPP, discounting, informational regime, and control rules. Given Omega, the Cut Theorem shows that the consolidated value of a perimeter P depends only on boundary quantities across the cut P -&gt; O, while internal reconnections are valuation-invariant. This provides (i) sufficient statistics for valuation with linear computational complexity, (ii) standardized reporting through the Perimeter-of-Validity and Cut Summary, and (iii) transformation laws that clarify how different observers relate. Applications span IFRS consolidation, national accounts, fund-of-funds, pyramids, and clearing networks, all seen as special cases of a general principle of economic relativity. Case studies (market capitalization by country, keiretsu, fund-of-funds) illustrate how CBV eliminates double counting while ensuring comparability and auditability.
  To address practical concerns, we establish robustness bounds that quantify how errors in initial data propagate to consolidated values, and we introduce a dynamic CBV-Fisher protocol for intertemporal comparisons, ensuring consistency with official chain-linking practices. These additions clarify the time scale of application, the role of averaging procedures, and the horizon of reliable measurement. Finally, we make explicit the scope and limitations of CBV: it is a normative measurement/consolidation rule in linear accounting environments, while in macroeconomic closures or with nonlinear payoffs it must be coupled with equilibrium or clearing models.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Study of Smart Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the mid-1990s, the concept of smart growth emerged in the United States as a critical response to the phenomenon of suburban sprawl. To promote sustainable urban development, it is necessary to further investigate the principles and applications of smart growth. In this paper, we propose a Smart Growth Index (SGI) as a standard for measuring the degree of responsible urban development. Based on this index, we construct a comprehensive 3E evaluation model (covering economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental sustainability) to systematically assess the level of smart growth. For empirical analysis, we selected two medium-sized cities from different continents: Wuhu County, China, and Colima, Mexico. Using an improved entropy method, we evaluated the degree of smart growth in recent years and analyzed the contributions of various policies to sustainable urban development. Guided by the ten principles of smart growth, we further linked theoretical insights to practical challenges and formulated a development plan for both cities. To forecast long-term trends, we employed trend extrapolation based on historical data, enabling the prediction of SGI values for 2020, 2030, and 2050. The results indicate that Wuhu demonstrates greater potential for smart growth compared with Colima. We also simulated a scenario in which the population of both cities increased by 50 percent and re-evaluated the SGI. The analysis suggests that while rapid population growth tends to slow the pace of smart growth, it does not necessarily exert a negative impact on the overall trajectory of sustainable development. Finally, we conducted a study on the application of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) theory in Wuhu County and proposed several policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the city's sustainable urban development.</description>

      <title>Ideology, institutions, and economic growth: panel evidence 1995 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does it matter whether a government is "left wing" or "right wing" for economic growth? Using a panel of 113 countries (1995 2022), we combine: (i) the economic ideology of the executive branch (V Dem), (ii) the disaggregated institutional quality of the economic freedom index (Heritage), separating a core institutional block (HN: property rights, government integrity, judicial effectiveness) from a block of liberalization policies (HL: trade/financial openness, regulatory efficiency, size of government), and (iii) economic performance (GDP per capita PPP and its growth, World Bank). We estimate panel models with fixed effects by country and year, and standard errors grouped by country. We find that HN is strongly associated with higher income levels, while HL, on average globally, is not significant for income level once HN is controlled for, nor does it consistently predict short term growth. Government ideology exhibits weak direct effects on growth, although it operates indirectly via HL (right wing governments tend to have higher HL scores). Robustness tests with long five-year differences and country specific trends reinforce that, in the long run, "institutions prevail over politics." We conclude with recommendations for developing countries: prioritize the institutional core (rule of law, anti-corruption, effective justice) as a basis for policies whether left-wing or right wing to bear fruit in terms of growth</description>

      <title>Sustainability Risks under Lotka-Volterra Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The record-breaking heat in recent years, along with other extreme weather conditions worldwide has not only warned us about the devastating effects of global warming but also revived our interest in studying sustainability risks on a broader scale. In this paper, we propose a generalised model of sustainability risks characterising the economic-environmental-social nexus (EVS) based on a classic Lotka-Volterra framework. Compared to the World3 model proposed by Meadows et al. (1972) in their landmark study "The Limits to Growth", our model has numerous advantages such as i) better analytical tractability, ii) more representative characterisation of economic development arising from innovation, and iii) can be adopted in many potential applications of modelling sustainability risks from its sub-dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Paradox of Doom: Acknowledging Extinction Risk Reduces the Incentive to Prevent It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the salience of extinction risk as a source of impatience. Our framework distinguishes between human extinction risk and individual mortality risk while allowing for various degrees of intergenerational altruism. Additionally, we consider the evolutionarily motivated "selfish gene" perspective. We find that the risk of human extinction is an indispensable component of the discount rate, whereas individual mortality risk can be hedged against - partially or fully, depending on the setup - through human reproduction. Overall, we show that in the face of extinction risk, people become more impatient rather than more farsighted. Thus, the greater the threat of extinction, the less incentive there is to invest in avoiding it. Our framework can help explain why humanity consistently underinvests in mitigation of catastrophic risks, ranging from climate change mitigation, via pandemic prevention, to addressing the emerging risks of transformative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>When and Why is Persuasion Hard? A Computational Complexity Result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative foundation models improve, they also tend to become more persuasive, raising concerns that AI automation will enable governments, firms, and other actors to manipulate beliefs with unprecedented scale and effectiveness at virtually no cost. The full economic and social ramifications of this trend have been difficult to foresee, however, given that we currently lack a complete theoretical understanding of why persuasion is costly for human labor to produce in the first place. This paper places human and AI agents on a common conceptual footing by formalizing informational persuasion as a mathematical decision problem and characterizing its computational complexity. A novel proof establishes that persuasive messages are challenging to discover (NP-Hard) but easy to adopt if supplied by others (NP). This asymmetry helps explain why people are susceptible to persuasion, even in contexts where all relevant information is publicly available. The result also illuminates why litigation, strategic communication, and other persuasion-oriented activities have historically been so human capital intensive, and it provides a new theoretical basis for studying how AI will impact various industries.</description>
