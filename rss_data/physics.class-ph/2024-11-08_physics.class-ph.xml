      <title>The continuum limit of k-space cavity angular momentum is controlled by an infinite range difference operator</title>

Abstract: A wavepacket (electromagnetic or otherwise) within an isotropic and homogeneous space can be quantized on a regular lattice of discrete k-vectors. Each k-vector is associated with a temporal frequency omega; together, k and omega represent a propagating plane-wave. While the total energy and total linear momentum of the packet can be readily apportioned among its individual plane-wave constituents, the same cannot be said about the packet's total angular momentum. One can show, in the case of a reasonably smooth (i.e., continuous and differentiable) wave packet, that the overall angular momentum is expressible as an integral over the k-space continuum involving only the Fourier transform of the field and its k-space gradients. In this sense, the angular momentum is a property not of individual plane-waves, but of plane-wave pairs that are adjacent neighbors in the space inhabited by the k-vectors, and can be said to be localized in the k-space. Strange as it might seem, this hallmark property of angular momentum does not automatically emerge from an analysis of a discretized k-space. In fact, the discrete analysis shows the angular momentum to be distributed among k-vectors that pair not only with nearby k-vectors but also with those that are far away. The goal of the present paper is to resolve the discrepancy between the discrete calculations and those performed on the continuum, by establishing the conditions under which the highly non-local sum over plane-wave pairs in the discrete k-space would approach the localized distribution of the angular momentum across the continuum of the k-space.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>
