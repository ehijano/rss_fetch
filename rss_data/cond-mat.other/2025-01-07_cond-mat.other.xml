      <title>Why a Bose-Einstein condensate cannot exist in a system of interacting bosons at ultrahigh temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a Bose-Einstein (BE) condensate of atoms exists in a system of interacting Bose atoms at $T\lesssim T^{(i)}_{c}$, where $T^{(i)}_{c}$ is the BE condensation temperature of an ideal gas. It is also generally accepted that BE condensation is impossible at ``ultrahigh'' temperatures $T\gg T^{(i)}_{c}$. While the latter property has been theoretically proven for an ideal gas, no such proof exists for an interacting system, to our knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approximate mathematical proof for a finite, nonrelativistic, periodic system of $N$ spinless interacting bosons. The key point is that, at $T\gg T^{(i)}_{c}$, the main contribution to the occupation number $N_{0}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\wp}e^{-E_{\wp}/k_{B}T}\langle \Psi_{\wp}|\hat{a}^{+}_{\mathbf{0}}\hat{a}_{\mathbf{0}}|\Psi_{\wp}\rangle$, corresponding to atoms with zero momentum, originates from the states containing $N$ elementary quasiparticles. These states do not contain the BE condensate of zero-momentum atoms, implying that an ultrahigh temperature should ``blur'' such a condensate.</description>

      <title>Gearing of nitrate ions in ammonium nitrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reorienting polyatomic ions such as NH4+ and NO3- exhibit weak magnetic fields because the ions at the extremities trace out current loops; if the periodic reorientations become long-range ordered (i.e. gearing of neighboring NO3-), then the magnetic susceptibility should exhibit a unique signature along the different crystallographic axes. For the case of ammonium nitrate NH4NO3, we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a- and b-axes upon crossing its order-disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest the first step pertains to the NO3- planes shifting away from facing only along the b-axis and onto the a-axis by 45{\deg}. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH4+ and NO3-. In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c-axis and its large magnitude suggest the NO3- remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH4+ become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c-axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.</description>

      <title>Cavity quantum electrodynamics of photonic temporal crystals</title>

Abstract: Photonic temporal crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of PTCs that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic temporal crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.</description>

      <title>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</title>

Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>
