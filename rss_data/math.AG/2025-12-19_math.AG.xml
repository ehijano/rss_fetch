      <title>On the Nonprojectedness of Supermoduli with Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Punctures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the supermoduli space $\mathfrak {M}_{g,n,2r}$ of Super Riemann Surfaces (SRS) of genus $g$, with $n$ Neveu-Schwarz punctures and $2r$ Ramond punctures. We improve the result of Donagi, Witten, and Ott by showing that the supermoduli space $\mathfrak M_{g,n,2r}$ is not projected if $g\geq n+5r+3$.</description>

      <title>Separable rational connectedness and $k$-plane sections of hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a smooth hypersurface of degree d in P^n over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. We show that X must be separably rationally connected and must contain a free line if either p is at least d or if p is at least d-1 and the defining equation has some partial derivative that is not too singular. We also show that X must be separably rationally connected in any characteristic if d = 4 and n is sufficiently large. Along the way, we generalize results on the spaces of k-planes in X to characteristic p and connect some of these questions to the spaces of linear sections of X.</description>

      <title>From affine algebraic racks to Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce analogues of algebraic groups called algebraic racks, which are pointed rack objects in the category of schemes over a ground field. Addressing a problem of Loday, we construct a functor assigning a canonical Leibniz algebra to every affine algebraic rack. This functor recovers the Lie algebras of affine algebraic groups (via conjugation quandles) and the Leibniz algebras of algebraic Lie racks, and it is compatible with closed subracks and left ideals. We also compare properties of affine algebraic racks, commutative corack algebras, and their Leibniz algebras.</description>

      <title>Bubbling limits of non collapsing polarized K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit and complete description of bubbling limits of a non-collapsing limit of polarized K3 surfaces in terms of the period mapping. In particular, we show that bubbling limits only depend on algebro-geometric data of the given family. As a corollary, this gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of de Borbon--Spotti and confirms that Odaka's algebro-geometric candidate gives genuine bubbling limits in K3 surfaces case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of integral transforms under various forms of base change. In particular, we establish a yoga of local algebra and fibers to test for derived equivalences via integral transforms. This partially generalizes a result of Orlov to singular varieties and strengthens many results in the literature to arbitrary fields. Additionally, it provides new insight into fibrations and their singularities arising in more arithmetically flavored contexts (e.g.\ projective and flat schemes over a DVR).</description>

      <title>L-equivalences via Symplectic and $F_4$ Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a construction of Kanemitsu from [9] and observations by Rampazzo in [19], we find examples of zero divisors in the Grothendieck ring of varieties by taking the zero loci of sections of vector bundles over symplectic and $F_4$ Grassmannians. These zero divisors yield instances of non-trivially L-equivalent Calabi-Yau varieties. This methodology is inspired by a similar process performed by Ito et al. on $G_2$ Grassmannians in [8].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the locus of square matrices having at least one eigenvector on a prescribed algebraic variety $X$. When $X$ is a linear subspace, this data locus is known as the Kalman variety of $X$ and was studied first by Ottaviani and Sturmfels. Motivated by recent applications to quantum chemistry and optimization, in this work, we focus on nonlinear Kalman varieties, that is, Kalman varieties relative to arbitrary projective varieties $X$. We study the basic invariants of these varieties, such as their dimensions, degrees, and singularities. Furthermore, Ottaviani and Sturmfels provide determinantal equations in the linear case. We generalize their result to Kalman varieties of hypersurfaces by providing a determinantal-like description of their equation.</description>

Abstract: The splitting field of an elliptic surface $\mathcal E$ defined over ${\mathbb Q}(t)$ is the smallest subfield $\mathcal K$ of $\mathbb C$ such that ${\mathcal E}({\mathbb C}(t))\cong {\mathcal E}({\mathcal K}(t))$. In this paper, we determine the splitting field ${\mathcal K}_m$ and a set of linearly independent generators for the Mordell--Weil lattice of Shioda's elliptic surface with generic fiber given by ${\mathcal E}_m: y^2=x^3 +t^{m} +1$ over ${\mathbb Q}(t)$ for positive integers $1\leq m\leq 12$.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on split toric varieties, for the height induced by any big and nef divisor class. This formula establishes new cases of the extension of Manin's conjecture to $\mathcal{M}$-points, as introduced by the author. As a special case of our result, we strengthen the results obtained by Pieropan and Schindler on Campana points of bounded height on toric varieties. As another special case, we obtain an asymptotic for the number of weak Campana points of bounded height, which is novel even for projective space.
  We illustrate our result by giving an asymptotic for the number of points on projective space of bounded height for which the product of coordinates is powerful.</description>

      <title>Semigroups, Cartier divisors and convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Newton--Okounkov bodies provides direct relations and points out analogies between the theory of mixed volumes of convex bodies, on the one hand, and the intersection theories of Cartier divisors and of Shokurov $b$-divisors, on the other hand. The classical inequalities between mixed volumes of convex bodies correspond to inequalities between intersection indices of nef Cartier divisors on an irreducible projective variety and between the birationally invariant intersection indices of nef type Shokurov $b$-divisors on an irreducible algebraic variety. Such algebraic inequalities are known as Khovanskii--Teissier inequalities. Our proof of these inequalities is based on simple geometric inequalities on two dimensional convex bodies and on pure algebraic arguments. The classical geometric inequalities follow from the algebraic inequalities. We collected results from a few papers which were published during the last forty five years. Some theorems of the present paper were never stated, but all ideas needed for their proofs are contained in the published papers. So we avoid all heavy proofs. Our goal is to present an overview of the area. Notions of homogeneous polynomials on commutative semigroups and of their polarizations provide an adequate language for discussing the subject. We use this language through the paper.</description>

      <title>Projective Variety Recovery from Unknown Linear Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how a smooth irreducible algebraic variety $X$ of dimension $n$ embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ (with $m \geq n+2$), which degree is $d$, can be recovered using two projections from unknown points onto unknown hyperplanes. The centers and the hyperplanes of projection are unknown: the only input is the defining equations of each projected varieties. We show how both the projection operators and the variety in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ can be recovered modulo some action of the group of projective transformations of $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$. This configuration generalizes results obtained in the context of curves embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^3$ and results concerning surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^4$.
  We show how in a generic situation, a characteristic matrix of the pair of projections can be recovered. In the process we address dimensional issues and as a result establish a necessary condition, as well as a sufficient condition to compute this characteristic matrix up to a finite-fold ambiguity. These conditions are expressed as minimal values of the degree of the dual variety.
  Then we use this matrix to recover the class of the couple of projections and as a consequence to recover the variety. For a generic situation, two projections define a variety with two irreducible components. One component has degree $d(d-1)$ and the other has degree $d$, being the original variety.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study moduli spaces of sextic curves with simple singularities. Through period maps of K3 surfaces with ADE singularities, we prove that such moduli spaces admit algebraic open embeddings into arithmetic quotients of type IV domains. For all cases, we prove the identifications of GIT compactifications and Looijenga compactifications. We also describe Picard lattices in an explicit way for many cases. For nodal cases, we prove that the orbifold structures on the two sides of the period map are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Baily--Borel compactifications of period images and the b-semiampleness conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address two questions related to the semiampleness of line bundles arising from Hodge theory. First, we prove there is a functorial compactification of the image of a period map of a polarizable integral pure variation of Hodge structures for which the Griffiths bundle extends amply. In particular the Griffiths bundle is semiample. We prove more generally that the Hodge bundle of a Calabi--Yau variation of Hodge structures is semiample subject to some extra conditions, and as our second result deduce the b-semiampleness conjecture and the existence of a functorial Hodge-theoretic compactification of moduli spaces of polarized Calabi--Yau varieties. The semiampleness results (and the construction of the Baily--Borel compactifications) crucially use o-minimal GAGA, and the deduction of the b-semiampleness conjecture uses work of Ambro and results of Koll\'ar on the geometry of minimal lc centers to verify the extra conditions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a logarithmic cobordism $\omega^{\text{Log}}$ ring of pairs $(X,D)$ of varieties equipped with a simple normal crossings divisor $D\subset X$, analogous to the algebraic cobordism ring $\omega^{\text{LP}}$ of Levine-Pandharipande, and we provide an application to logarithmic DT invariants. We also prove prove that if we impose the relation $(X',D') = (X,D)$ for $(X',D')\rightarrow (X,D)$ a logarithmic modification, then the new "logarithmic+modification" cobordism ring $\omega^{\text{Log+Mod}}$ collapses to the algebraic cobordism ring of Levine-Pandharipande: $\omega^{\text{LP}}\cong \omega^{\text{Log+Mod}}$</description>

      <title>Frobenius generation for algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the Frobenius morphism on derived categories associated with algebraic stacks in positive characteristic. Particularly, we show that in many cases sufficiently many Frobenius pushforwards of a compact generator produce a classical or strong generator for the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves. In the case of Deligne--Mumford stacks, we can bound the number of iterates required.</description>

      <title>The de Jong fundamental group of $\mathbb{P}^1_C$ depends on $C$ and is not always topologically countably generated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$ complete and algebraically closed, we show that the de Jong fundamental group $\pi_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^1_C)$ depends on $C$ and, if $C$ has cardinality $&gt;2^{\mathbb{N}}$, that it is not topologically countably generated. The result and proofs generalize to any connected rigid analytic variety with a non-constant map to $\mathbb{P}^n_C$.</description>

      <title>The de Jong fundamental group of a non-trivial abelian variety is non-abelian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the de Jong fundamental group of any non-trivial abelian variety over a complete algebraically closed extension $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is non-abelian. Generalizing an argument for $\mathbb{P}^1_C$, we also show that the de Jong fundamental group of any connected rigid analytic variety over $C$ admitting a non-constant map to $\mathbb{P}^n_C$ (e.g., an abelian variety) depends on $C$ and is big.</description>

      <title>Algebraic $K$-theory for squares categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new formalism for $K$-theory, called squares $K$-theory. This formalism allows us to simultaneously generalize the usual three-term relation $[B] = [A] + [C]$ for an exact sequence $A \hookrightarrow B \twoheadrightarrow C$ or for a subtractive sequence $A\hookrightarrow B \leftarrow C$, by defining $K_0$ of a squares category to satisfy a four-term relation $[A]+[D]= [C] + [B]$ for a ``good'' square diagram with these corners. Examples that rely on this formalism are $K$-theory of smooth manifolds of a fixed dimension and $K$-theory of (smooth and) complete varieties. Another application we give of this theory is the construction of a derived motivic measure taking value in the $K$-theory of homotopy sheaves.</description>

      <title>A GLSM realization of derived equivalence in $U(1) \times U(2)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the derived equivalence between Calabi--Yau mixed branches using the B-brane hemisphere partition function in anomalous gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs). For a family of anomalous $U(2)$ GLSMs, we study the infrared behavior of B-branes under RG flow and the variation of FI parameters in the quantum K\"ahler moduli space. As characterized by the big and small window categories of the GLSM, the RG flow effect is analyzed according to the properties of their B-brane central charges as hemisphere partition functions. The result generalizes the band restriction rules in anomalous abelian GLSMs (Clingempeel--Floch--Romo) to some $U(2)$ models. As an application, we study a family of $U(1)\times U(k)$ models for $k=1,2$, which realize a Fano UV sigma model and two IR phases as mixed branches accompanied by local Calabi--Yau Higgs components. By applying the restriction rules, we establish new derived equivalences between Calabi--Yau varieties from these anomalous models.</description>

      <title>Degenerate symplectic fixed points and Gromov-Witten invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for Fano toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds which admit nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion. We prove a new cuplength estimate of symplectic fixed points involved in deformed spectral invariants. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Tropical fans supporting a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An affine tropical fan is called regular if it supports a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection. For some cases the classification of regular fans is already complete. It was proved by Fink that tropical varieties of degree 1 are exactly Bergman fans, and later Esterov and Gusev classified all lattice polytopes whose mixed volume equals 1. We introduce the notion of a gallery for tropical fans and use it to classify all one-dimensional regular fans, thereby obtaining a minimal model programme for such fans. In dimension 2 we prove a finiteness theorem: every regular fan that satisfies the given upper bound condition is precisely the support of a finite covering by two-dimensional galleries, and only finitely many such fans exist.</description>

      <title>On the integral cohomology of real toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real toric manifolds are the real loci of nonsingular complete toric varieties. In this paper, we calculate the integral cohomology groups of real toric manifolds in terms of the combinatorial data contained in the underlying simplicial fans, generalizing a formula due to Cai and Choi. We also present a combinatorial formula to describe the ring structure, modulo the ideal consisting of elements of order $2$. As an application, a combinatorial-algebraic criterion is established for when a real toric manifold is spin$^c$.</description>

      <title>Parametrizing the Grassmannian using pipe dreams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Postnikov gave a parametrization for the totally non-negative Grassmannian using the matroid decomposition and associating a network with \reflectbox{L}-diagrams. Talaska and Williams extend this result to the entire Grassmannian by using the Deodhar decomposition instead of the matroid decomposition, and the networks this time are associated with the generalized versions of \reflectbox{L}-diagrams, which are called Go-diagrams. We provide an alternative parametrization for the Deodhar components, this time constructing a network based on the pipe dreams associated with the Go-diagrams.
  This parametrization has several nice properties; for one, it allows us to easily calculate the image of a point under the isomorphism $Gr_{k,n}\simeq Gr_{n-k,n}$. The second feature of this parametrization is that if we write the Pl\"ucker coordinates using the Lindst\"orm-Gessel-Viennot (LGV) lemma in our parametrization, we can associate a pipe dream to each summand, which allows us to reveal additional structure on the summands. Finally, as an application of our parametrization, we describe a case where we can conclude whether one Deodhar component lies inside the closure of another.</description>
