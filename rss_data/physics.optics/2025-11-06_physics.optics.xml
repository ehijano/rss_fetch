      <title>Correcting Fabrication-Induced Curvature in Micromirror-Based Spatial Light Modulators with a Microlens Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer generated holography requires high-speed spatial light modulators (SLMs) for dynamically patterning light in 3D. Piston-motion micromirror-based SLMs support high-speed ($\geq$ 10 kHz) phase modulation; however, fabricating micromirror arrays with sufficient fill factor necessary for high diffraction efficiency is challenging. In particular, the larger mirrors of high fill factor designs are susceptible to stress-induced curvature that significantly degrades optical performance. In this work, we introduce an optical compensation method using a pitch-matched microlens array (MLA) to focus light onto just the center of each mirror. Our approach thus avoids curvature-induced artifacts and improves optical fill factor to nearly 100$\%$, independent of the original mechanical fill factor. Through simulations and experiments on a fabricated micromirror array with bowed mirrors, we show that the Pearson correlation coefficient of the imparted phase profile is improved from 0.11 to 0.85 and the brightness of a holographically-generated single spot is enhanced by 8$\times$ with our microlens array in place. Our hybrid optical-electromechanical strategy thus provides a scalable path toward high-speed, high-fidelity wavefront control for applications such as adaptive optics, holographic displays, and optogenetics.</description>

      <title>Optimal sparse networks for synchronization of semiconductor lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inevitable random frequency differences among semiconductor lasers present an obstacle to achieving their collective coherence, but previous worked showed that fully (all-to-all) coupled networks can still be synchronized even in the weakly coupling regime. An outstanding question is whether sparsely coupled network structures exist that lead to strong synchronization. This paper gives an affirmative answer: optimal sparse coupling configurations can be found which enables near-complete synchronization. Quite surprisingly, with respect to synchronization, certain sparse networks can outperform fully coupled networks, when the weights of coupling are placed dominantly on the laser pairs with large frequency differences. The counterintuitive phenomenon can be explained by a thermodynamic potential theory that maps the time-delay-induced phase dynamics to an energy landscape. These findings suggest a scalable and cost-effective approach to achieving robust, steady-state synchronization of semiconductor lasers in the presence of disorder and noise.</description>

      <title>Contactless Modulation of Intralayer and Interlayer Excitons in MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures with Acoustoelectric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a platform that enables surface acoustic wave (SAW) modulation of both intralayer and interlayer excitons in MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures. Harnessing the coupled piezoelectric and strain fields of SAWs, this integrated approach allows for dynamic, precise, and fully contactless control of excitonic properties, a capability essential for the realization of next generation optoelectronic, quantum photonic, and excitonic devices. We identify two distinct modulable interlayer excitons in optical communication bands: IX$_{K\Gamma}$ in the O band (around 1300 nm) and IX$_{K\!-\!K}$ in the S band (around 1500 nm); these two excitons display a robust twist-angle-independent energy splitting of 120 meV, in agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The type-II band alignment induced by the SAW not only promotes efficient exciton dissociation but also enables direct and tunable modulation of photoluminescence via the formation of confined piezoelectric potential wells. Furthermore, by simultaneously generating in-plane and out-of-plane SAW fields, the platform achieves selective manipulation of intralayer and interlayer excitons, inducing quadratic Stark effects for intralayer excitons and linear Stark effects for interlayer excitons. These findings provide new insights into SAWexciton interactions in van der Waals heterostructures, broaden the operational spectral range, and establish pathways toward on-chip acousto-optic and quantum optoelectronic devices with advanced excitonic functionality.</description>

      <title>Incorporating QM/MM molecular dynamics into the few-mode quantization approach for light-matter interactions in nanophotonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of light-matter interactions between organic chromophores and confined photons of (plasmonic) nano-resonators, we introduce a general framework that couples ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics with few-mode field quantization to simulate light-matter interactions of molecular emitters at the nanoscale. Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly. Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system.</description>

      <title>Graphene-enabled coherent terahertz wave detection and thickness determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent detection and interferometry in the terahertz (THz) regime are key capabilities that enable applications ranging from astronomy to non-destructive testing. Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength thickness accuracy of $\sim$5 $\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10 nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity - without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation wireless communication, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Conventional Scintillation Statistics with Turbulence Impacted Coupled Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of optical fields through polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) rods under atmospheric turbulence conditions, employing a generalized Lorentz dipole oscillator model with nonlinear restoring forces and dipole-dipole coupling. The theoretical framework incorporates second- and third-order anharmonic terms ($\beta_i|r_i|r_i$ and $\alpha_i|r_i|^2r_i$) alongside dyadic Green's function-mediated coupling between localized dipoles. Gradient forces arising from spatially non-uniform field distributions and Lorentz force perturbations are incorporated through d'Alembert's principle, revealing an effective inertia mechanism that opposes rapid field redistribution. Modal diagonalization demonstrates that synchronized dipole oscillations can compensate turbulence-induced wavefront distortions, with the perturbation force $\delta F_{\text{Pert}}(t) = F'_{\text{Inertia}} - F_{\text{Inertia}}$ governing the compensation efficacy. Experimental verification employs a pseudo-random phase plate (PRPP) generating Kolmogorov-spectrum turbulence, with 200 frames recorded across four configurations: baseline, turbulence-only, and turbulence with one or two PMMA rods. Statistical analysis quantifies scintillation index variations. Results indicate that dipole-dipole coupling energy transitions enable partial turbulence compensation when stronger suppression observed for longer propagation paths through increased synchronization.</description>

      <title>Far-UVC Field Emission Device at 226 nm and its Sub-Nanometer thick GaN/AlN Quantum Well Anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on unique features of ultra-thin GaN/AlN quantum wells and demonstrate a new field emission device for human-safe disinfection with an external quantum efficiency of 18% and superior reliability, as compared to far-UVC LEDs. We investigate the behavior of a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination via Al vacancies-oxygen complexes in AlN barriers as a function of GaN well thickness and come to the conclusion that direct relaxation of confined states via mid-gap traps is prohibited and the main mechanism limiting the quantum efficiency (QE) is the carrier escape followed by non-radiative SRH recombination in the AlN barriers. As a consequence, the QE is highly dependent on the defect density, QW width and temperature which allowed us to reach a descent emissions at 226 nm wavelength although at wall plug efficiency being low, at 0.02%. We build a complete Light-Current-Voltage model and find that present device performance is limited by the self-heating and by the Child's space charge effect, both limitations can be easily addressed with some additional engineering efforts.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of hyperbolicity in surface enhanced Raman sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plasmonic nanostructure-based substrate, serving as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate, enhances the Raman scattering of molecules. By employing an electron beam lithography followed by our recently developed nano-electroplating protocol, a gold nanorod array SERS substrate can be fabricated to detect lower molecular analyte concentrations, such as Rhodamine 6G (R6G) solution. As the critical dimensions of the nanorod array decrease, they exhibit hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) characteristics with anisotropic permittivity behavior. In our study, we fabricated two sets of nanorod arrays: one in the HMM regime (140 nm periodicity) and the other in the non-HMM regime (400 nm periodicity), aiming to evaluate the performance of each set based on R6G detection. The obtained results are compared and analyzed using COMSOL simulation and Raman mapping and the role of hyperbolicity is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence has triggered exponential growth in data volume, demanding rapid and efficient processing. High-speed, energy-efficient, and parallel-scalable computing hardware is thus increasingly critical. We demonstrate a wafer-scale non-volatile topological photonic computing chip using topological modulators. Leveraging the GHz-speed electro-optic response and nonvolatility of ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films via topological photonic confinement, Our chip enables thousand-fold faster reconfiguration, zero-static-power operation, and a computational density of 266 trillion operations per second per square millimeter . This density surpasses that of silicon photonic reconfigurable computing chips by two orders of magnitude and thin-film lithium niobate platforms by four orders of magnitude. A 16-channel wavelength-space multiplexed chip delivers 1.92 TOPS throughput with 95.64% digit-recognition accuracy and 94.5% precision for solving time-varying partial differential equations. Additionally, the chip supports functional reconfiguration for high bandwidth density optical I/O. This work establishes ferroelectric topological photonics for efficient high-speed photonic tensor processing.</description>

      <title>Resonant states reveal strong light-matter coupling in nanophotonic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic resonances are a powerful tool for controlling light-matter interactions. However, unlocking many of the most scientifically intriguing and technologically promising phenomena requires entering the strong coupling regime, where light and matter fully mix, unlocking emergent properties of the coupled states. Nowadays, distinguishing between weak and strong coupling primarily relies on studying the optical response of the hybrid system at real frequencies, which only provides indirect estimates of the underlying resonant dynamics. In contrast, the actual resonances live at complex frequencies. Resolving this contradiction, we show that photonic resonant states provide the framework to unambiguously quantify the strength of light-matter interaction, enabling a rigorous distinction between weak and strong coupling regimes. Assuming a single dominant resonant state of the bare photonic resonator, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that captures the interaction between the photonic resonator and an arbitrary number of material resonances. Our analysis reveals that, unlike most coupled-oscillator models commonly employed in the literature, hybridization not only introduces off-diagonal coupling but also shifts the bare eigenfrequency of the photonic mode. We demonstrate the accuracy of this approach by studying planar and spherical silver resonators filled with a molecular material whose properties were extracted from quantum-chemical simulations. Our work paves the way towards a unified description of light-matter coupling in open photonic environments.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>

      <title>2D Addressable Mid-infrared Metasurface Spatial Light Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces enable dynamic control of light for applications in beam steering, pixelated holography, and adaptive optics, but demonstrations of two-dimensional (2D) electrically addressable arrays have so far been limited. Here we introduce a scalable 2D architecture based on phase-change materials (PCMs) integrated metasurfaces and apply it to realize the first transmissive mid-infrared (mid-IR) spatial light modulator (SLM). The device is fabricated through standard silicon photonic foundry processing combined with backend-of-line (BEOL) integration and employs multilayer backend metal interconnects to implement a crossbar addressing scheme. Each pixel is integrated with a silicon diode selector to suppress sneak-path currents, a feature essential for scaling to large arrays. The result establishes a foundry-compatible route to high-density, large-area active metasurfaces with independently tunable pixels.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution Optical Near-field EM for bio- and materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy has been key to tremendous advances in science, technology, and medicine, revealing structure and dynamics across time and length scales. However, combining high spatial and temporal resolution in a non-invasive, label-free imaging technique remains a central challenge in microscopy. Here, we introduce Optical Near-field Electron Microscopy (ONEM), a method that converts optical near-field intensity patterns into photoelectron emission, enabling nanometer-scale imaging using low-energy electron microscopy. ONEM achieves 31 nm spatial and sub-second temporal resolution without exposing the sample to electrons, preserving structural and functional integrity. We demonstrate ONEM across three distinct domains: imaging polarization-dependent plasmon modes in metal nanostructures; visualizing live Escherichia coli in liquid with orientation-resolved contrast in 3D; and capturing real-time electrodeposition of copper nanoclusters from solution. These results establish ONEM as a versatile platform for damage-free super-resolution imaging of interface dynamics in both vacuum and liquid, with broad implications for biology, electrochemistry, and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Polarization conversion using hybrid near-zero and high-index metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-zero-refractive index materials display unique optical properties such as perfect transmission through distorted waveguides, cloaking, and inhibited diffraction. Compared to conventional media, they can fundamentally behave differently to light impinging from air, owing to the phenomenon of total external reflection. This makes them attractive for evanescent wave phenomena without prism coupling or sub-wavelength air gaps. Here, we introduce a strategy for linear-to-circular polarization conversion based on this effect. Practically realizable device designs are presented using hybrid structures of near-zero index and high index materials in a simple planar geometry. Our results predict polarization conversion in both reflection and transmission configurations based on naturally available epsilon-near-zero materials and illustrate the role of loss in limiting performance. Although the operation wavelength is limited to the epsilon-near-zero region, the concept can be implemented from the terahertz to optical domains using tunable epsilon-near-zero materials.</description>

      <title>Structure and interactions of atoms and diatomic molecules: from ultracold gases to doped solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>

      <title>A Normalized Descriptor for Unbiased Screening of Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order nonlinear optical materials enable frequency doubling of light (second-harmonic generation, SHG), which is essential for optoelectronic applications ranging from materials characterization to quantum technologies. However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\chi^{(2)}$ using new databases of \textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We show that $\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\hat{d}$ as a robust, generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and optimization across broad application frequencies.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in nonlinear superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is rapidly becoming the focus of modern attosecond science. Here, we demonstrate numerically how such states can arise by considering a modification of the well-known problem of superradiance encountered already by Dicke. Similarly to him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian, non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Quantum Coherent Superradiant States in Relation to Exciton-Phonon Interactions and the Fundamental Soliton in Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of macroscopic coherent quantum states at room temperature is crucial in modern quantum technologies. In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable single terahertz meta-atom ultrastrong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator (cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to $\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.</description>

Abstract: Using real-space view of high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids, we develop a physically transparent and gauge-invariant approach for distinguishing intraband and interband HHG mechanisms. Our approach relies on resolving the harmonic emission according to the separation between Wannier states involved in radiative transitions. We show that the intra- and inter-band HHG emission exhibit striking qualitative differences in their dependence on this separation and can be clearly distinguished using the Wannier basis.</description>

      <title>Quantised helicity in optical media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the definition of optical helicity in a medium. Our approach resolves the problem that duality transformations which simultaneously combine $\mathbf{E}$ with $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ with $\mathbf{B}$ are incompatible with linear constitutive relations. We find that the helicity density in a medium, as the conserved quantity associated with duality transforms, must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and that it can be expressed naturally in terms of the elementary polarised excitations of the system. In media for which the helicity is conserved, each circular excitation carries a well-defined helicity. However, in a medium for which the helicity is not conserved, we find that the time-varying helicity can be viewed in terms of oscillations between different helicity eigenstates, analogous to neutrino oscillations. Here we explicitly study the helicity in homogeneous and lossless media but we believe that, differently to other choices, this helicity is readily generalisable to media that may be inhomogeneous, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal.</description>

      <title>Direct and mediated dipole-dipole interactions in a reconfigurable array of optical traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum experience both electrostatic and light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, offering a versatile platform to explore mesoscopic entanglement and many-body dynamics. A significant challenge in optical trap arrays is to achieve site-resolved, point-to-point tunability: adjusting the laser parameters of a single trap typically induces global cross-talk to neighboring sites, hindering independent control. Inspired by tunable couplers in superconducting circuits, we implement an ancillary nanoparticle that functions as a coupler between two target nanoparticles. Within a reconfigurable three-particle array, we demonstrate broad tunability of the direct dipole-dipole interaction by controlling the phase and position of the traps. In addition, we observe spectral signatures consistent with mediated interactions between the target particles via the ancillary one, manifested as mode participation beyond the uncoupled response. Our results establish a practical route to tailored, site-resolved control in multi-particle optical trap arrays, expanding the optical-binding toolbox and opening opportunities for programmable oscillator networks relevant to macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Determination of the irreducible representations at high symmetry points of two-dimensional square lattice plasmonic crystals by far-field radiations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two topologically trivial and nontrivial systems are brought together, an energy state is formed at the interface that is robust against disorder and perturbation. For crystalline electronic and electromagnetic systems, their band topology can be determined by studying the eigenmode symmetries at high symmetry points (HSPs) in the Brillouin zone. However, such determination is not simple considering the topological properties of a system are highly geometry dependent. For leaky photonic systems, the information of eigenmodes is embedded in the radiation fields, thus providing a means for probing the band topology and designing the interface state. Here, we formulate the far-field characteristics of the energy bands at HSPs in 2D square lattice photonic systems and reveals, unlike the conventional 2D tight-binding model, several polarization-dependent band inversions occur at the {\Gamma}and X points, leading to changes in their band topology in a subtle manner. As a result, by carefully tuning the system geometry to facilitate p- and s-trivial and non-trivial Zak phases, polarization-selective interface states at the {\Gamma}and X points can coexist at the same heterojunction. We conduct angle- and polarization-resolved diffraction spectroscopy on 2D Au plasmonic nanohole arrays to verify the theory and observe such interface states.</description>

Abstract: The transport of intensity equation (TIE) has revolutionized phase retrieval in optical microscopy, yet its application to complex media with absorption/scattering remains challenging. Here, we present a coupled TIE-TPE (transport of phase equation) framework derived directly from the paraxial wave equation with complex optical potential. By decomposing the refractive index field into a spatially uniform mean field and local fluctuation field, our approach enables simultaneous reconstruction of refractive-index fluctuations and attenuation coefficients without linearization assumptions. We establish reconstruction validity bounds that define the measurable parameter region where reconstruction remains physically consistent. Experimental demonstration with microlens arrays and HeLa cells shows robust recovery of optical properties even in the transparent-limit regime where attenuation signals approach detection thresholds. Furthermore, we provide the first experimental verification of attenuation symmetry -- a fundamental property of wave propagation that characterizes reciprocity in light-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: Localization of light requires high-Q cavities or spatial disorder, yet the wave nature of light may open novel opportunities. Here we suggest to employ Mie-tronics as a powerful approach to achieve the hybridization of different resonances for the enhanced confinement of light via interference effects. Contrary to a conventional approach, we employ the symmetry breaking in finite arrays of resonators to boost the Q factors by in-plane multiple scattering. Being applied to photonic moire structures, our approach yields a giant enhancement of the Purcell factor via twist-induced coupling between degenerate collective modes. Our findings reveal how finely tuned cooperative scattering can surpass conventional limits, advancing the control of wave localization in many subwavelength systems.</description>

Abstract: Coherent interferometric scattering microscopy (iscat) enables nanoparticle tracking on microsecond timescales and with nanometer precision, and has become a key tool in structural and cellular biophysics. The achievable localization precision in such experiments is fundamentally limited by photon shot noise. Here, we analyze three-dimensional localization precision under oblique illumination in iscat using the framework of (Quantum) Fisher Information. We show that tilting the illumination can enhance localization precision and accuracy per detected photon, while increasing robustness to defocusing. Surprisingly, rotating coherent scattering microscopy (rocs), which incoherently averages oblique illuminations, achieves higher spatial resolution but lower localization precision. Our results establish the quantum limits of off-axis interferometric imaging and reveal that resolution and precision can behave in opposite ways -- a key insight for designing next-generation coherent microscopes.</description>

Abstract: Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the Fock dimension (Fock number of the highest occupied Fock state of one mode), and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the Fock dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</description>

Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. However, experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Modal Analysis of Multimode Waveguides from Amplitudes via Large-Step Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing multimodal waveguide performance depends on modal analysis; however, existing methods focus predominantly on modal power distribution (MPD) and, limited by experimental hardware and conditions, exhibit low accuracy, poor adaptability, and high computational cost. This work presents a novel framework for comprehensive modal analysis (recovering both power and relative phase) using aperture field (AF) and far field (FF) amplitude measurements. We formulate the modal analysis as a nonconvex optimization problem under a power-normalization constraint and, inspired by recent advances in deep learning, introduce a large-step strategy to solve it. Our method retrieves both the MPD and the modal relative-phase distribution(MRPD). The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through visualization of the nonconvex optimization process via its loss landscape. Under noiseless conditions, analysis results of $93$ electromagnetic modes indicate that the relative amplitude accuracy $\mathrm{MRE_{Modulus}}$, and the phase accuracy $\mathrm{MAE_{Phase}}$, both reach the level of machine precision. Through noise simulations of the AF and environmental background, the operational principles of the method are demonstrated under signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions ranging from $10~\mathrm{dB}$ to $60~\mathrm{dB}$. Experiments further confirm that error suppression is effectively achieved by increasing the number of sampling points, thereby maintaining high accuracy and strong robustness. Within a unified evaluation framework, the absolute amplitude error $\mathrm{MAE_{Modulus}}$, and the phase error $\mathrm{MAE_{Phase}}$, are as low as $1.633\times10^{-8}$ and $0$, respectively. The accuracy is significantly superior to existing methods, while also exhibiting higher computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>

Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond heat-based logic, writing and reset in an antiferromagnetic magnetoresistive memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18855</link>

Abstract: Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.</description>
