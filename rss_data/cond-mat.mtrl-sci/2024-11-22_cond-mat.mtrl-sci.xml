      <title>Direct X-Ray Measurements of Strain in Monolayer MoS$_{2}$ from Capping Layers and Geometrical Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain induced through fabrication, both by patterning and capping, can be used to change the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials or other thin films. Here, we explore how capping layers impart strain to monolayer MoS$_{2}$ using direct x-ray diffraction measurements of the lattice. We first observe the impact of naturally-oxidized metal layers ($\sim$1.5 nm Al) and subsequently-deposited Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (15 nm to 25 nm thick) on the 2D material, and find that the strain imparted to MoS$_{2}$ is mainly controlled by the interfacial adhesion of the seed layer in addition to the substrate adhesion. Then, using test structures which mimic transistor contacts, we measure enhanced strain from such patterns compared to blanket films. Furthermore, we observe significant tensile strain - up to 2% in monolayer MoS$_{2}$, one of the largest experimental values to date on a rigid substrate - due to highly-stressed blanket metal capping layers. These results provide direct evidence supporting previous reports of strain effects in 2D material devices.</description>

      <title>Atomistic investigation of irradiation-induced defect dynamics in FeNiCu medium-entropy alloy: effect of local chemical order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium and high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs) have garnered significant attention as potential nuclear structural materials due to their excellent stability at high temperatures and resistance to radiation. However, the common use of Co in M/HEAs, which exhibits high radioactivity under radiation has prompted the development of Co-free M/HEAs for nuclear applications. In this study, we investigate the irradiation behavior of FeNiCu, a promising Co-free medium-entropy alloy (MEA) with a focus on the effect of local chemical order (LCO) using hybrid-molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. Considerable LCOs in Cu-Cu and Fe-Ni pairs were observed in the thermodynamically stable ordered system. To conduct a comprehensive comparative study of irradiation-induced defect formation and dynamics, cumulative displacement cascades up to 500 were performed in random and ordered configurations of the MEA as well as in pure Ni for benchmark. Our study revealed LCO configuration as the most radiation resistant structure among the three. Complex potential energy landscape (PEL) in MEAs disrupts dislocation growth resulting in its dispersed distribution. The Cu-rich uniform regions in the ordered system act as defect traps enabling faster diffusion and high defect recombination resulting in formation of the dislocation networks in/near these regions. The lower stair-rod dislocation density in the ordered system revealed its high resistance to irradiation swelling signifying the effect of LCO even more, positioning FeNiCu MEA as a strong candidate for future nuclear application. Additionally, the theoretical insights into defect evolution covering formation and diffusion in both random and ordered structures enhance our understanding of LCO's impact, offering a solid foundation for the future development of radiation-resistant M/HEAs for nuclear applications.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network framework for energy mapping of hybrid monte-carlo molecular dynamics simulations of Medium Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have drawn significant interest in material design and discovery. Graph neural networks (GNNs), in particular, have demonstrated strong potential for predicting material properties. The present study proposes a graph-based representation for modeling medium-entropy alloys (MEAs). Hybrid Monte-Carlo molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations are employed to achieve thermally stable structures across various annealing temperatures in an MEA. These simulations generate dump files and potential energy labels, which are used to construct graph representations of the atomic configurations. Edges are created between each atom and its 12 nearest neighbors without incorporating explicit edge features. These graphs then serve as input for a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) based ML model to predict the system's potential energy. The GCNN architecture effectively captures the local environment and chemical ordering within the MEA structure. The GCNN-based ML model demonstrates strong performance in predicting potential energy at different steps, showing satisfactory results on both the training data and unseen configurations. Our approach presents a graph-based modeling framework for MEAs and high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which effectively captures the local chemical order (LCO) within the alloy structure. This allows us to predict key material properties influenced by LCO in both MEAs and HEAs, providing deeper insights into how atomic-scale arrangements affect the properties of these alloys.</description>

      <title>Accelerating active learning materials discovery with FAIR data and workflows: a case study for alloy melting temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) is a powerful sequential optimization approach that has shown great promise in the discovery of new materials. However, a major challenge remains the acquisition of the initial data and the development of workflows to generate new data at each iteration. In this study, we demonstrate a significant speedup in an optimization task by reusing a published simulation workflow available for online simulations and its associated data repository, where the results of each workflow run are automatically stored. Both the workflow and its data follow FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles using nanoHUB's infrastructure. The workflow employs molecular dynamics to calculate the melting temperature of multi-principal component alloys. We leveraged all prior data not only to develop an accurate machine learning model to start the sequential optimization but also to optimize the simulation parameters and accelerate convergence. Prior work showed that finding the alloy composition with the highest melting temperature required testing 15 alloy compositions, and establishing the melting temperature for each composition took, on average, 4 simulations. By developing a workflow that utilizes the FAIR data in the nanoHUB database, we reduced the number of simulations per composition to one and found the alloy with the lowest melting temperature testing only three compositions. This second optimization, therefore, shows a speedup of 10x as compared to models that do not access the FAIR databases.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Antiferromagnetic Phase in Metastable Self-Intercalated Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been of particular interest due to their unique magnetic properties and layered structure that can be promising for a wide range of spintronic applications. One of the most exciting compounds in this family of magnets is chromium telluride, Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$, which has shown rich magnetic phases with varied Cr concentrations. An emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering has been found in Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ (equivalently, Cr$_{5}$Te$_8$), which is induced by intercalating 0.25 Cr atom per unit cell within the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of CrTe$_2$. In this work, we report an increased N\'eel Temperature ($T_\mathrm{N}$) of the AFM phase in Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ by slightly reducing the concentration of Cr intercalants. Moreover, the intercalated Cr atoms form a metastable 2$\times$2 supercell structure that can be manipulated by electron beam irradiation. This work offers a promising approach to tuning magnetic and structural properties by adjusting the concentration of self-intercalated magnetic atoms.</description>

      <title>Sign of the Gap Temperature Dependence in CsPb(Br,Cl)3 Nanocrystals Determined by Cs-Rattler Mediated Electron-Phonon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, the striking sign reversal in the near-ambient slope of the gap temperature dependence of colloidal CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) compared to its Br counterpart, remains unresolved. Pure bromide NCs exhibit a linear gap increase with increasing temperature, to which thermal expansion and electron-phonon interaction equally contribute. In contrast, the temperature slope for the chlorine compound gap is outspoken negative. By combining temperature and pressure-dependent photoluminescence on a series of CsPb(Br1-xClx)3 NCs, we unravel the origin of such inversion. Responsible is solely the electron-phonon interaction, undergoing a sudden change in sign and magnitude due to activation of an anomalous electron-phonon coupling mechanism linked to vibrational modes characterized by synchronous octahedral tilting and Cs rattling. This takes place in the shrunken orthorhombic NC lattice for Cl concentrations exceeding ca. 40%. We have thus clarified a puzzling result directly impacting the optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskite NCs.</description>

      <title>Xenon-metal pair formation in UO2 investigated using DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experimental study on a spent uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sample from Belgium Reactor3 (BR3) identified a unique pair structure formed by the noble metal phase (NMP) and fission gas (xenon [Xe]) precipitate. However, the fundamental mechanism behind this structure remains unclear. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between five different metal precipitates (molybdenum [Mo], ruthenium [Ru], palladium [Pd], technetium [Tc], and rhodium [Rh]) and the Xe fission gas atoms in UO2, by using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with the Hubbard U correction to compute the formation energies involved. All DFT+U calculations were performed with occupation matrix control to ensure antiferromagnetic ordering of UO2. The calculated formation energies of the Xe and solid fission products in the NMP reveal that these metal precipitates form stable structures with Xe in the following order: Mo &gt; Tc &gt; Ru &gt; Pd &gt; Rh. Notably, the formation energy of Xe-metal pairs is lower than that of the isolated single defects in all instances, with Mo showing the most negative formation energy, likely accounting for the observed pair structure formation.</description>

      <title>Hot Carrier Dynamics in Operational Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main approaches to inhibit carrier cooling in semiconductor systems enabling the study of hot carrier solar cell protocols is the use of concentrated illumination to obtain high power densities and create a phonon bottleneck. This, however, typically also increases the lattice temperature of the solar cells significantly. Accordingly, the solar cells subject to high concentration illumination also need to withstand high operating temperatures. Having previously demonstrated the high temperature tolerance of the triple halide perovskite (FA0.8Cs0.2Pb1.02I2.4Br0.6Cl0.02) solar cells, here the hot carrier relaxation dynamics are studied in these devices using high power transient absorption (TA) measurements. In addition to monitoring TA spectra obtained at different time delays, the thermalization mechanisms of hot carriers is mapped with power dependent TA to extract the carrier cooling time in this system under in-operando conditions at various bias conditions that reflect the Jsc, Vmax and Voc of these structures, and subsequently deconvolve the underlying physics of carrier relaxation; as well as track the dynamics of the thermalization close to working conditions of the solar cells. These measurements uncover a complex interaction of hot carrier thermalization involving the temporal carrier density, transport, and extraction, and apparent non-equivalent contributions with respect to non-equilibrium photogenerated electrons and holes in these metal halide perovskite solar cell architectures.</description>

      <title>Hidden altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden spin polarization (HSP) with zero net spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization has been proposed in certain nonmagnetic centrosymmetric compounds, where the individual sectors forming the inversion partners are all inversion asymmetry. Here, we extend this idea to antiferromagnetic materials with $PT$ symmetry (the joint symmetry of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)), producing zero net spin polarization in total, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses altermagnetism, giving rise to non-zero local spin polarization in the real space, dubbed "hidden altermagnetism". By first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$ can serve as a possible candidate showing altermagnetic HSP. By applying an external electric field to break the global $P$ symmetry, the hidden altermagnetism can be separated and observed experimentally. Our works extend the hidden physics, and will also advance the theoretical and experimental search for new type of spin-polarized materials.</description>

      <title>Circular photogalvanic effect in an inversion-symmetry-broken bilayer germanium nanosheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-to-charge conversion in monolayer and bilayer germanium(Ge) nanosheets was demonstrated via the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). The CPGE current generated in a spin-splitting state of the Ge nanosheet reached a maximum value when the thickness of the Ge nanosheet corresponded to bilayer germanene, indicating that the top layer of the bilayer Ge nanosheet mainly contributed to the spin-to-charge conversion. Because the hybridization of orbitals is suppressed by isolation from the bottom Al layer for the top Ge nanosheet, the observed spin-to-charge conversion has a possibility to be related to the intrinsic features of germanene with breaking of inversion symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in tellurium derives from a Peierls distortion driven by strong electron-phonon coupling, making this material a unique candidate for observing a light-induced topological phase transition. By using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES), we reveal that upon near-infrared photoexcitation the Peierls gap is modulated by displacively excited coherent phonons with $\mathrm{A_{1g}}$ symmetry as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking $\mathrm{E'_{LO}}$ modes. By comparison with state-of-the-art TDDFT+U calculations, we reveal the microscopic origin of the in-phase oscillations of band edges, due to phonon-induced modulation of the effective Hubbard $U$ term.</description>

      <title>Assessing data-driven predictions of band gap and electrical conductivity for transparent conducting materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has offered innovative perspectives for accelerating the discovery of new functional materials, leveraging the increasing availability of material databases. Despite the promising advances, data-driven methods face constraints imposed by the quantity and quality of available data. Moreover, ML is often employed in tandem with simulated datasets originating from density functional theory (DFT), and assessed through in-sample evaluation schemes. This scenario raises questions about the practical utility of ML in uncovering new and significant material classes for industrial applications. Here, we propose a data-driven framework aimed at accelerating the discovery of new transparent conducting materials (TCMs), an important category of semiconductors with a wide range of applications. To mitigate the shortage of available data, we create and validate unique experimental databases, comprising several examples of existing TCMs. We assess state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML models for property prediction from the stoichiometry alone. We propose a bespoke evaluation scheme to provide empirical evidence on the ability of ML to uncover new, previously unseen materials of interest. We test our approach on a list of 55 compositions containing typical elements of known TCMs. Although our study indicates that ML tends to identify new TCMs compositionally similar to those in the training data, we empirically demonstrate that it can highlight material candidates that may have been previously overlooked, offering a systematic approach to identify materials that are likely to display TCMs characteristics.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Intrinsic Hall Effect through Competing Berry Curvature in Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic and electronic transport properties of the layered chalcogenide Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ in its single crystalline form. This material exhibits a ferromagnetic transition at a critical temperature of $T_C = 191$ K, characterized by significant thermal hysteresis in the magnetization data below this temperature. Measurements of isothermal magnetization, magnetocaloric effect, and magnetoresistance indicate that the system exhibits strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy, with the $c$-axis serving as the easy axis of magnetization. The Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ compound shows pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE); however, existing experimental and theoretical data do not provide a clear understanding of the nature and origin of this phenomenon. Our experimental findings suggest that the skew scattering mechanism primarily accounts for the observed AHE. In contrast, our theoretical study reveals the presence of gapped nodal points accompanied by non-zero Berry Curvature, which are expected to contribute towards intrinsic AHE. A detailed analysis of the electronic band structure, obtained through density functional theory calculations, reveals that the Berry Curvature at different nodal points exhibit both positive and negative signs. These opposing contributions largely cancel each other out, thereby significantly diminishing the intrinsic contribution to the AHE.</description>

Abstract: A high-efficient one-step synthesis of cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen was developed just by thermal treatment of KN3 powders. The Raman and infrared spectra confirm the formation of polymeric nitrogen networks. Thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimeter measurements show that the content of cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen is as high as 1.5 wt% with high thermal stability, which is the highest content value so far.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Nanoparticles in Liquid Crystals: The Role of Ionic Transport at Small Concentrations of the Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the visible influence of the ultra-small concentrations (1 wt.% or less) of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles (average size 24 nm) on the current-voltage characteristics and capacitance of the dielectric liquid crystal (LC) 5CB. The pure LC cell demonstrates higher current (and thus smaller resistance) than the LC cells filled with a very small concentration (0.5-1) wt.% of BTO nanoparticles. The same trend is observed for the charge-voltage characteristics: the capacitance loop is the widest for the pure LC cell and becomes noticeably thinner in the presence of (0.5-1) wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. This seems counterintuitive, because 1 wt.% of ferroelectric nanoparticles very slightly modify the effective dielectric response and should not influence on the director distribution and elastic properties of the LC. We conclude that a possible physical reason of this observation is the influence of the ionic-electronic screening charges, which cover the ferroelectric nanoparticles and become polarized in the external field, on the ionic transport in the LC.</description>

      <title>Deformation and adiabatic heating of single crystalline and nanocrystalline Ni micropillars at high strain rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformation behavior of single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel were studied with in situ micropillar compression experiments from quasi-static to high strain rates up to 10^3/s. Deformation occurred by dislocation slip activity in single crystal nickel whereas extensive grain boundary sliding was observed in nanocrystalline nickel, with a shift towards more inhomogeneous, localized deformation above 1/s. The overall strain rate sensitivity was observed to be nearly two times in nanocrystalline nickel compared to single crystal, as expected. Crystal plasticity based finite element modeling was used to estimate the adiabatic heating, spatially resolved within pillar, at the highest tested strain rates. The simulations predicted a significant temperature rise up to ~ 200 K in nanocrystalline Ni at the grain boundaries and ~ 20 K in single crystalline Ni, due to strain localization. The strain rate sensitivity exponent was observed to remain roughly constant over the tested strain rate range suggesting no change in deformation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Angular dependence of large negative magnetoresistance in a field-induced Weyl semimetal candidate HoAuSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular dependence of magnetoresistance (MR) in antiferromagnetic half-Heusler HoAuSn single crystals have been systematically studied. Negative MR, as large as 99%, is observed at 9 T, is not restricted to the specific configuration of applied magnetics fields and current, and can persist up to 20 K, much higher than the Neel temperature (TN 1.9 K). Experiments and first-principles calculations suggest that the observed large negative MR is derived from a magnetic field that reconstructs the band structure and induces a Weyl point, which changes the carrier concentration. Taking into consideration that large negative MR has so far been rarely reported, especially in antiferromagnetic materials, it is anticipated that the present work not only offers a guideline for searching materials with large negative MR but also helps to further realize other exotic topological electronic states in a large class of antiferromagnetic half-Heusler compounds.</description>

      <title>Quantitative modeling of spintronic terahertz emission due to ultrafast spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spintronic terahertz emitters, THz radiation is generated by exciting an ultrafast spin current through femtosecond laser excitation of a ferromagnetic-nonmagnetic metallic heterostructure. Although an extensive phenomenological knowledge has been built up during the last decade, a solid theoretical modeling that connects the generated THz signal to the laser induced-spin current is still incomplete. Here, starting from general solutions to Maxwell's equations, we model the electric field generated by a superdiffusive spin current in spintronic emitters, taking Co/Pt as a typical example. We explicitly include the detector shape which is shown to significantly influence the detected THz radiation. Additionally, the electron energy dependence of the spin Hall effect is taken into account, as well as the duration of the exciting laser pulse and thickness of the detector crystal. Our modeling leads to realistic emission profiles and highlights the role of the detection method for distinguishing key features of the spintronic THz emission.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.</description>

      <title>Self-passivation Causes the Different Fermi Level Pinning between Metal-Si and Metal-Ge Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-Ge contacts possess much stronger Fermi level pinning (FLP) than metal-Si contacts, which is commonly believed to be due to Ge having a narrower bandgap and higher permittivity in the context of FLP caused by metal-induced gap states. Here, we show that both Ge and Si have a similar FLP strength if they adopt an identical interface chemical bonding configuration at the contact interface by performing first-principles calculations: Si and Ge have FLP factors of 0.16 and 0.11, respectively, if they adopt the same reconstructed bonding configuration and have FLP factors of 0.05 and 0, respectively, if they adopt the same non-reconstructed bonding configuration. We illustrate that Ge prefers the latter configuration at the contact interface, which has denser dangling-bond-induced surface states, and Si prefers the latter one, which has a self-passivation effect for reducing the dangling bond-induced interface states, to reproduce the experimental data. By revealing the significance of dangling bond-induced interface gap states on FLP, these findings shed new light on lowering the contact resistance for developing future Si CMOS technology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon microspheres feature a pronounced phononic peak around 2000 cm-1 when they are thermally excited by means of a blue laser. This phononic signature corresponds to vibrational modes of silicon-hydrogen bonds and its emitted light can be coupled to Mie modes defined by the spherical cavity. The signal is apparently quite stable at moderate excitation intensities although there appeared some signs pointing to hydrides bonds reconfiguration and even hydrogen emission. Above a certain excitation threshold, a phase change from amorphous to poly-crystalline silicon occurs that preserves the good structural quality of the microspheres.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Bandgap in Nano-Scale Graphite: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphite, conventionally regarded as a gapless material, exhibits a bandgap of ~100 meV in nano-scale patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our advanced first-principles calculations, incorporating photoemission matrix element effects, predict this bandgap with remarkable accuracy and attribute it to mechanical distortions introduced during patterning. This work bridges theory and experiment, providing the direct evidence of a tunable bandgap in HOPG. Beyond its fundamental significance, this finding opens new possibilities for designing materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling advancements in terahertz devices and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Octahedral tilt-driven phase transitions in BaZrS3 chalcogenide perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites are lead-free materials for potential photovoltaic or thermoelectric applications. BaZrS$_3$ is the most studied member of this family due to its superior thermal and chemical stability, desirable optoelectronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. Phase transitions of the BaZrS$_3$ perovskite are under-explored in literature as most experimental characterization is performed at ambient conditions where the orthorhombic Pnma phase is reported to be stable. In this work, we study the dynamics of BaZrS$_3$ across a range of temperatures and pressures using an accurate machine-learned interatomic potential trained with data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. At 0Pa, we find a first-order phase transition from the orthorhombic to tetragonal I4/mcm phase at 610K, and a second-order transition from the tetragonal to the cubic Pm-3m phase at 880K. The tetragonal phase is stable over a larger temperature range at higher pressures. To confirm the validity of our model we report the static structure factor as a function of temperature and compare our results with published experimental data.</description>

      <title>Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts quantum emitters that exhibit single-photon emission and spin-dependent fluorescence at room temperature. These features make hBN a promising platform for quantum sensing and photonics. Despite many investigations of their optical properties, the emitters' chemical structure remains unclear, as does the role of contamination at surfaces and interfaces in forming the emitters or modifying their properties. We prepare hBN samples that are compatible with both confocoal photoluminescence microscopy (PL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and we use those techniques to investigate correlations between fluorescent emission, flake morphology, and surface residue. We find that the microscopy techniques themselves induce changes in hBN's optical activity and residue mophology: PL measurements induce photobleaching, whereas TEM measurements alter surface residue and emission characteristics. We also study the effects of common treatments $\unicode{x2014}$ annealing and oxygen plasma cleaning $\unicode{x2014}$ on the structure and optical activity of hBN. The results illustrate the power and importance of correlative studies to elucidate aspects of microscopic mechanisms that influence hBN's functionality as a host for quantum emitters and spin defects.</description>

      <title>A Python-Based Approach to Sputter Deposition Simulations in Combinatorial Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetron sputtering is an essential technique in combinatorial materials science, enabling the efficient synthesis of thin-film materials libraries with continuous compositional gradients. For exploring multidimensional search spaces, minimizing preliminary experiments is essen-tial, as numerous materials libraries are required to adequately cover the space, making it crucial to fabricate only those libraries that are absolutely necessary. This can be achieved by Monte Carlo particle simulations to model the deposition profile, e.g. by SIMTRA, which is an established package mainly designed for single cathode simulations. A strong enhance-ment of its capabilities is the development of a Python-based wrapper, designed to simulate multi-cathode sputter processes through parallel Monte Carlo simulations. By modeling a sputter chamber and determining the relationship between deposition power and rate for an exemplary quaternary system Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru, we achieve a match between simulated and measured compositions, with a mean Euclidean distance of 3.5%. The object-oriented design of the package allows easy customization and enables the definition of complex sputter sys-tems. Due to parallelization, simulating multiple cathodes results in no additional simulation time. These additions extend the capabilities of SIMTRA making it applicable in combinatorial materials research.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of States and Quasiparticles in Many-body Downfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the principles of many-body Hamiltonian complexity reduction via downfolding on an effective low-dimensional representation. We present a unique measure of fidelity between the effective (reduced-rank) description and the full many-body treatment for arbitrary (i.e., ground and excited) states. When the entire problem is mapped on a system of interacting quasiparticles [npj Computational Materials 9 (1), 126, 2023], the effective Hamiltonians can faithfully reproduce the physics only when a clear energy scale separation exists between the subsystems and its environment. We also demonstrate that it is necessary to include quasiparticle renormalization at distinct energy scales, capturing the distinct interaction between subsystems and their surrounding environments. Numerical results from simple, exactly solvable models highlight the limitations and strengths of this approach, particularly for ground and low-lying excited states. This work lays the groundwork for applying dynamical downfolding techniques to problems concerned with (quantum) interfaces.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of topological defects in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies point out far-reaching connections between the topological characteristics of structural glasses and their material properties, paralleling results in quantum physics that highlight the relevance of the nature of the wavefunction. However, the structural arrangement of the topological defects in glasses has so far remained elusive. Here we investigate numerically the geometry and statistical properties of the topological defects related to the vibrational eigenmodes of a prototypical three-dimensional glass. We find that at low-frequencies these defects form scale-invariant, quasi-linear structures and dictate the plastic events morphology when the system is subjected to a quasi-static shear, i.e., the eigenmode geometry shapes plastic behavior in 3D glasses. Our results indicate the existence of a deep link between the topology of eigenmodes and plastic energy dissipation in disordered materials, thus generalizing the known connection identified in crystalline materials. This link is expected to have consequences also for the relaxation dynamics in the liquid state, thus opening the door for a novel approach to describe this dynamics.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Antiferromagnetic Topological Nodal-line Kondo Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symbiosis of strong interactions, flat bands, topology and symmetry has led to the discovery of exotic phases of matter, including fractional Chern insulators, correlated moir\'e topological superconductors, and Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Correlated metals, such as those present in Kondo lattices, rely on the screening of local moments by a sea of non-magnetic conduction electrons. Here, we report on a unique topological Kondo lattice compound, CeCo2P2, where the Kondo effect - whose existence under the magnetic Co phase is protected by PT symmetry - coexists with antiferromagnetic order emerging from the flat bands associated with the Co atoms. Remarkably, this is the only known Kondo lattice compound where magnetic order occurs in non-heavy electrons, and puzzlingly, at a temperature significantly higher than that of the Kondo effect. Furthermore, at low temperatures, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in conjunction with a glide-mirror-z symmetry, results in a nodal line protected by bulk topology near the Fermi energy. These unusual properties, arising from the interplay between itinerant and correlated electrons from different constituent elements, lead to novel quantum phases beyond the celebrated topological Kondo insulators and Weyl Kondo semimetals. CeCo2P2 thus provides an ideal platform for investigating narrow bands, topology, magnetism, and the Kondo effect in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanostructuring for van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials are becoming increasingly popular in scientific and industrial applications because of their unique mixture of record electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. However, nanostructuring of vdW materials is still in its infancy and strongly depends on the specific vdW crystal. As a result, the universal self-assembled technology of vdW materials nanostructuring opens vast technological prospects. This work demonstrates an express and universal synthesis method of vdW nanoparticles with well-defined geometry using femtosecond laser ablation and fragmentation. The disarming simplicity of the technique allows us to create nanoparticles from over 50 vdW precursor materials covering transition metal chalcogenides, MXenes, and other vdW materials. Obtained nanoparticles manifest perfectly defined crystalline structures and diverse shapes, from nanospheres to nanocubes and nanotetrahedrons. Thus, our work provides a new paradigm for vdW nanostructuring with a vast potential of tunability for size, shape, and materials specific to the particular application.</description>

      <title>Current-induced brightening of vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform photoluminescence measurements on vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that are notorious for their low quantum yields. The gating of these emitters via few-layer graphene electrodes reveals a reproducible, gate-dependent brightening of the emitter, which coincides with a change in the direction of the simultaneously measured leakage current across the hBN layers. At the same time, we observe that the relative increase of the brightening effect scales linearly with the intensity of the excitation laser. Both observations can be explained in terms of a photo-assisted electroluminescence effect. Interestingly, emitters can also show the opposite behavior, i.e. a decrease in emitter intensity that depends on the gate leakage current. We explain these two opposing behaviors with different concentrations of donor and acceptor states in the hBN and show that precise control of the doping of hBN is necessary to gain control over the brightness of vacancy-related emitters by electrical means. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of vacancy-related defects in hBN that is necessary to make use of their potential for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Transition in Thermal Conductivity in Germanene Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an anomalous temperature-induced transition in thermal conductivity in germanene monolayer around a critical temperature $T_c = 350 \, \text{K}$. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal a transition from $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ scaling below $T_c$ to $\kappa \sim T^{-1/2}$ above, contrasting with conventional $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ behavior. This anomalous scaling correlates with long-scale characteristics timescale $\tau_2$ obtained from double exponential fitting of heat current autocorrelation function. Phonon mode analysis using normal mode decomposition indicates that a redshift in TA phonons reduces the acoustic-optical phonon gap, enhancing the phonon-phonon scattering and driving the anomalous scaling behavior. Moreover, non equilibrium simulations find a convergent thermal conductivity of germanene with sample size, in agreement with mode coupling theory, owing to high scattering of ZA phonons due to the inherent buckling of germanene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic devices are widely used in optomechanical experiments at the cutting-edge of precision experimental physics. Such devices often need to have high electrical conductivity but low reflectivity at optical wavelengths, which can be competing requirements for many commonly available coatings. In this manuscript, we present a technique to electroplate platinum with a highly convoluted surface on a $475\,\mathrm{\mu m } \, \times 500\,\mathrm{\mu m } \, \times 10\,\mathrm{\mu m }$ Silicon/Gold cantilever, preserving its electrical conductivity but reducing its reflectivity in the $0.3 - 1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ range by a factor of $100$ or greater. The fact that the deposition can be done post-fabrication without damaging delicate structures makes this technique of interest to a potentially large range of experimental applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. Based on this framework, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only outperforms traditional bond-orientational order parameters in phase classification tasks but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Ground-state magnetic structures of topological kagome metals RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome metals have attracted tremendous research interests recently, because they represent an ideal playground for exploring the fascinating interplay between their intrinsically inherited topologically non-trivial electron band structures, magnetism and electronic correlation effects, and the resultant novel electronic/magnetic states and emergent excitations. In this work, we report a comprehensive single-crystal neutron diffraction investigation of the ground-state magnetic structures of the recently discovered V-based topological kagome metals RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er). Furthermore, the sample synthesis details and our systematic studies of crystal structure, low-temperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties of these compounds via various in-house characterization techniques are also reported. It can be revealed that RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho) have a collinear ferromagnetic order in the ground state, with the ordered magnetic moment aligned along the c axis for R = Tb, Ho, while approximately 20${^\circ}$ tilted off from the c axis for R = Dy. In contrast, ErV$_6$Sn$_6$ shows an A-type antiferromagnetic structure with a magnetic propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.5), and with the ordered magnetic moment aligned in the ab plane. A comparison of the low-temperature magnetic structures for both the extensively investigated topological kagome metal series of RV$_6$Sn$_6$ and RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is given in details. This allows to gain new insights into the complex magnetic interactions, diverse single-ion magnetic anisotropies and spin dynamics in these compounds. The reported ground-state magnetic structures in RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) can pave the way for further explorations of the possible interplay between magnetism and topologically non-trivial electron band structures in the magnetically ordered phase regime.</description>

      <title>Low-Field Regime of Magnon Transport in Yttrium Iron Garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusive propagation of spin waves and their quanta - magnons - in the archetypal magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is under a surge of research for low-power and low-loss data communication. However, operation under external magnetic fields reduces magnon diffusion length, attenuates the voltage amplitude at measurement terminals, and complicates the architecture of magnonic devices. Here, we explore the low-field and field-free regime of diffusive magnon transport in YIG films. We demonstrate that the field-induced suppression of magnon diffusion length can be fully inhibited only at the zero-field limit. Even a modest field of 10mT attenuates the non-local spin voltage by $\sim$ 20$\%$ in a transport channel of $\sim$ 1$\mu$m long. Using Stoner-Wohlfarth macrospin simulations, we reveal that an often overlooked, in-plane uniaxial anisotropy becomes the critical parameter governing the field-free operation of magnonic devices. We further demonstrate a tenfold enhancement in the effective field associated with the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy of YIG films at low temperatures - a key finding for field-free operation of magnonic devices under cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting of multiphase microstructure evolution using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microstructure evolution, which plays a critical role in determining materials properties, is commonly simulated by the high-fidelity but computationally expensive phase-field method. To address this, we approximate microstructure evolution as a time series forecasting problem within the domain of deep learning. Our approach involves implementing a cost-effective surrogate model that accurately predicts the spatiotemporal evolution of microstructures, taking an example of spinodal decomposition in binary and ternary mixtures. Our surrogate model combines a convolutional autoencoder to reduce the dimensional representation of these microstructures with convolutional recurrent neural networks to forecast their temporal evolution. We use different variants of recurrent neural networks to compare their efficacy in developing surrogate models for phase-field predictions. On average, our deep learning framework demonstrates excellent accuracy and speedup relative to the "ground truth" phase-field simulations. We use quantitative measures to demonstrate how surrogate model predictions can effectively replace the phase-field timesteps without compromising accuracy in predicting the long-term evolution trajectory. Additionally, by emulating a transfer learning approach, our framework performs satisfactorily in predicting new microstructures resulting from alloy composition and physics unknown to the model. Therefore, our approach offers a useful data-driven alternative and accelerator to the materials microstructure simulation workflow.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advance of high-performance computing and electronic technologies, understanding thermal conductivity in materials has become increasingly important. This study presents a novel method: the Site-projected Thermal Conductivity (SPTC) that quantitatively estimates the local (atomic) contribution to heat transport, leveraging the Green-Kubo thermal transport equations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on disordered and amorphous graphene, amorphous silicon, and grain boundaries in silicon-germanium alloys. Amorphous graphene reveals a percolation behavior for thermal transport. The results highlight the potential of our method to provide new insights into the thermal behavior of materials, offering a promising avenue for materials design and performance optimization.</description>

      <title>How Semilocal Are Semilocal Density Functional Approximations? -Tackling Self-Interaction Error in One-Electron Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electric Polarization via Exchange Striction Interaction in CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ by Sr-Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate contributions to the TSDC density from both extrinsic thermally stimulated depolarization processes and intrinsic pyroelectric current arising from magnetically induced polarization changes. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of defects of different kinds, e.g., vacancies, voids, dislocations, grain boundaries, and surfaces, in realistic materials can strongly modify and even dictate the thermodynamics of phase transformations. Our study demonstrates, both theoretically and experimentally, that in the ordering of Fe_xAl_1-x (x&gt;0.6) alloys subjected to high-temperature treatment, the relaxation of the as-prepared chemically disordered alloy into the ordered B2 state is hampered by another process. A manifestation of this is an increase in the alloy's magnetization. A plausible explanation for a non-monotonous behavior of the magnetization we observe is segregation of Al into structural defects, e.g., grain boundaries, and thus purification of the Fe host lattice. Qualitatively, experimental findings reported here are supported by molecular dynamics simulation of the phase transformation kinetics in Fe_xAl_1-x. These studies can be useful for choosing the preparation strategy for functional alloys.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing allows for the manipulation of highly correlated states whose properties quickly go beyond the capacity of any classical method to calculate. Thus one natural problem which could lend itself to quantum advantage is the study of ground-states of condensed matter models, and the transitions between them. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in a simple, noise-robust manner which is agnostic to the method of ground state preparation. This work shows promising potential for near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, including avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of $&lt;1\%$ at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. Our proposal is based upon transition-orbital and group-theoretical analyses of beyond-nearest-neighbour spin-orbit couplings, which are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around $30\%$ under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Reducing disorder in Ge quantum wells by using thick SiGe barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the disorder properties of two-dimensional hole gases in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers, using thick SiGe barriers to mitigate the influence of the semiconductor-dielectric interface. Across several heterostructure field effect transistors we measure an average maximum mobility of $(4.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$ at a saturation density of $(1.72 \pm 0.03) \times 10^{11}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, corresponding to a long mean free path of $(30 \pm 1)~\mathrm{\mu m}$. The highest measured mobility is $4.68 \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$. We identify uniform background impurities and interface roughness as the dominant scattering mechanisms limiting mobility in a representative device, and we evaluate a percolation-induced critical density of $(4.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{9} ~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. This low-disorder heterostructure, according to simulations, may support the electrostatic confinement of holes in gate-defined quantum dots.</description>
