      <title>Residual energy in weakly compressible turbulence with a mean guide field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy distribution is a fundamental property of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r &lt; 0$, which is consistent with Solar wind observations, while in highly compressible turbulence simulations $E_r &gt; $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfv\'en Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($\beta$) of the simulations. We drive turbulence by either injecting velocity or magnetic fluctuations at large scales and study the power spectra of kinetic, magnetic, density, and $E_r$. Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations and a $\propto k^{-3/2}$ cascade, consistent with the dynamic alignment theory. Kinetically-driven simulations give rise to a $\propto k^{-1}$ scaling, consistent with interactions between Alfv\'en waves scattered by density inhomogeneities -- a hallmark of reflection-driven turbulence. Residual energy is positive with a spectral slope ($\alpha$) depending on $\beta$ as: for $\beta = 4.0$, $-2 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -5/3$, for $\beta = 1.0$, $-5/3 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -3/2$, and for $\beta = 0.3$, $\alpha \approx -1$.</description>

      <title>X-ray Evolution of Young Stars: Early Dimming and Coronal Softening in Solar-Mass Stars with Implications for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) emission from young stars plays a critical role in shaping the evolution of planetary atmospheres and the conditions for habitability. To assess the long-term impact of high-energy stellar radiation, it is essential to empirically trace how X-ray luminosities and spectral hardness evolve during the first ~&lt;1 Gyr, when atmospheric loss and chemical processing are most active. This study extends the X-ray activity-mass-age analysis of &lt;25 Myr stars by Getman et al. (2022) to ages up to 750 Myr, using Gaia-based cluster memberships, new Chandra observations of five rich open clusters (~45--100 Myr), and archival ROSAT and Chandra data for three older clusters (~220--750 Myr). We find a mass-dependent decay in X-ray luminosity: solar-mass stars undergo a far more rapid and sustained decline, accompanied by coronal softening and the disappearance of hot plasma by ~100 Myr, compared to their lower-mass siblings. These trends in solar-mass stars are likely linked to reduced magnetic dynamo efficiency and diminished ability to sustain large-scale, high-temperature coronal structures. The trends are significantly stronger than predicted by widely used XUV-rotation-age relations. The revised trends imply systematically lower rates of atmospheric mass loss and water photolysis, as well as altered ionization environments and chemical pathways relevant to the formation of prebiotic molecules, for planets in close orbits around solar analogs. These effects persist throughout at least the ~&lt;750 Myr interval probed in this study.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Characterizing Very Low Mass Spectral Blend Binaries with Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to identifying and characterizing unresolved, very low mass spectral blend binaries composed of late-M, L, and T dwarfs using machine learning methodologies. We generated and evaluated a series of hierarchical random forest models to distinguish spectral blends from single very low-mass dwarfs, and to classify their primary and secondary components. Models were trained on a sample of single and synthesized binary templates generated from empirical spectra. We explored various aspects of the design of our models, and find that models trained on a full range of single and binary combinations have the best performance for identification and component classification. These models achieve binary identification recall and precision of $\gtrsim$85%, median component classification errors of $\lesssim$0.1 subtypes, and systematic classification uncertainties of $\lesssim$1 subtype, outperforming index-based methods in terms of fidelity, range, and speed. Optimal performance is achieved for binaries composed of L and T dwarf primaries and late-L and T dwarf secondaries. When applied to the spectra of previously confirmed very low-mass binaries, model performance is degraded due to the prevalence of systems with similar component types, but remains high in the optimal performance range. We propose potential improvements to these models, which can be used to explore binary populations among the thousands to millions of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs anticipated with large-scale spectral surveys such as SPHEREx and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Projected rotational velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey is an ESO large programme designed to obtain multi-epoch spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>Observational Properties of $\beta$ Cephei Stars: 88 new samples discovered Based on TESS and Gaia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of $\beta$ Cephei (BCEP) stars by integrating photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) with astrometric parameters from Gaia Data Release 3. Utilizing TESS's short-cadence (SC) and full-frame image (FFI) photometry, along with Gaia parallaxes and temperatures derived from the Extended Stellar Parametrizer for Hot Stars (ESP-HS) pipeline, we identify 88 new BCEP stars and candidates--85 from SC data and 3 from SPOC-processed FFI observations. These targets exhibit visual magnitudes ranging from 8.0 to 12.0 mag, parallaxes between 0.11 and 1.74 mas, effective temperatures of 18,000 to 30,000 K, and luminosities from 1,500--38,000 $L_\odot$, consistent with previously cataloged BCEP populations, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our classification criteria. Key findings include: (1) a significant detection disparity between SC and FFI datasets, with 30\% of SC targets exceeding 18,000 K compared to only 0.7\% in FFI, reflecting observational biases toward high-luminosity, hotter stars in SC data; (2) four samples near the red edge of the theoretical instability strip, exhibiting sparse pulsation modes that are important samples for testing pulsation models under low-mass, low-temperature conditions; and (3) spatial clustering within the Galactic disk ($|b| &lt; 20^\circ$), with two high-latitude outliers likely representing runaway stars ejected from disk environments. Our analysis underscores the critical role of space-based photometry in detecting low-amplitude pulsators and the transformative potential of multi-survey integration in the era of time-domain astronomy. These results provide new samples to constrain stellar pulsation theories of massive stars and to study Galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>X-ray properties of RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for X-ray counterparts to RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables using data from the first eROSITA all-sky survey. We identify seven RR Lyrae and eight Cepheid variables with positional matches to X-ray sources. While most Cepheid associations appear reliable, the RR Lyrae matches are predominantly spurious. Only one source, OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-00252, appears to be a plausible RR Lyrae detection, potentially representing the first observational evidence of X-ray emission from a star of this type. Its inferred luminosity suggests that RR Lyrae stars are intrinsically at least two orders of magnitude fainter in X-rays than the brightest Cepheids. We also observe a tentative increase in X-ray luminosity with pulsation period among classical Cepheids, and higher luminosities in type II Cepheids at comparable periods. These trends may reflect intrinsic differences in atmospheric structure and shock efficiency, offering new insight into the mechanisms driving high-energy emission in pulsating stars.</description>

      <title>Hemispheric Magnetic Asymmetry and Cross-Equatorial Circulation Cells within the Sun's Near-Surface Shear Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using time-distance helioseismic measurements of meridional flow in the near-surface shear layer over a period of 14 years, starting from May 2010, we probe the depth structure and evolution of its cross-equatorial part. We confirm that the hemispheric magnetic asymmetry determines the amplitude and direction of such flows. Additionally, we find that these flows turn over and change direction at depths below 0.97R, forming circulation cells with lifetimes dictated again by the hemispheric magnetic imbalance, which is dominated by the occurrences of large sunspots. We also examine connections between cross-equatorial magnetic flux plumes and the flows, and discuss their implications for the equatorial flux cancellation/submergence and the poleward transport of flux.</description>

      <title>A multi-viewpoint comparison of the velocity field of coronal propagating disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale propagating disturbances (PD) are ubiquitous in the solar corona. Time-Normalised Optical Flow (TNOF) is a method developed for mapping PD velocity fields in time series of Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) images. We show PD velocity fields of a quiet Sun (QS) region containing a small coronal hole (CH) and filament channel (FC) jointly observed by Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard the Solar Orbiter and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The QS observations acquired on 28 October 2023 in 174A channel of High Resolution EUV Imager (HRIEUV) of EUI and 171A channel of AIA are used. During the time of the observations, the separation angle between Solar Orbiter and SDO was approximately 26\de. A novel image alignment analysis shows that the dominant formation heights are 11.4Mm for HRIEUV and 4Mm for AIA. Despite this height difference, the PD velocity fields obtained from the observations from the two instruments are in good agreement across the region. In the QS the median PD speed is around 6.7 and 7.4\kms\ for HRIEUV and AIA respectively, with maximum speeds of around 40\kms. The small equatorial CH is a region dominated by a low temperature of $\approx$0.8MK and is host to high PD speeds, with a median speed of 17\kms. The velocity field bridges coherently across the CH from neighbouring QS regions from east to west, thus the CH must be overlaid by a system of long, low-lying closed magnetic loops. This unexpected configuration is supported by a potential field (PF) magnetic model and may be due to the longevity of the CH, allowing time for interchange reconnection with neighbouring closed-field regions. The FC is observed to be multithermal, with a narrow central strip of high emission at both low (0.8MK) and high (2.5MK) temperatures and low emission at warm (1.2MK) temperature. The FC has PD speeds similar to those of the QS.</description>

      <title>Solar-cycle variations in meridional flows and rotational shear within the Sun's near-surface shear layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using solar-cycle long helioseismic measurements of meridional and zonal flows in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun, we study their spatio-temporal variations and connections to active regions. We find that near-surface inflows towards active latitudes are part of a local circulation with an outflow away from them at depths around 0.97 R, which is also the location where the deviations in the radial gradient of rotation change sign. These results, together with opposite-signed changes over latitude and depth in the above quantities observed during the solar minimum period, point to the action of the Coriolis force on large-scale flows as the primary cause of changes in the rotation gradient within the NSSL. We also find that such Coriolis force-mediated changes in near-surface flows towards active latitudes only marginally change the amplitude of zonal flow and hence are not likely to be its driving force. Our measurements typically achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio ($&gt;$5$\sigma$) for near-surface flows but can drop to 3$\sigma$ near the base (0.95 R) of the NSSL. Close agreements between the depth profiles of changes in rotation gradient and in meridional flows measured from quite different global and local helioseismic techniques, respectively, show that the results are not dependent on the analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Thread Separation and Expansion Observed in Multi-Stranded Solar Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical expectation that coronal loops should expand with height contrasts with observations that typically show constant cross-sections. We investigate the idea that this discrepancy results from loops being composed of fine threads whose expansion occurs below the resolution limits of instruments like SDO/AIA. In this paper, we present two significant findings: (1) several extended loops exhibit measurable expansion, suggesting length as a critical factor in detection capability, and (2) high-resolution Solar Orbiter/EUI observations have captured expanding loops in active regions. For both AIA and EUI data, we observe cases where thread separation is directly visible as the loops evolve. These findings complement our previous work indicating AIA loops may consist of relatively few threads. Collectively, these observations provide compeling evidence supporting the multi-thread model and offer a potential resolution to the long-standing loop expansion problem in solar coronal physics. However, the high densities and narrow temperature distributions of observed coronal loops remain unresolved.</description>

      <title>HEL1OS -- A Hard X-ray Spectrometer on Board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HEL1OS (High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer) is one of the remote sensing payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission designed to continuously monitor and measure the time-resolved spectra of solar flares between 8 keV and 150 keV. This broad energy range has been covered by using compound semiconductor detectors: cadmium telluride (CdTe: 8 - 70 keV) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT: 20 - 150 keV) with geometric areas of 0.5 cm$^2$ and 32 cm$^2$, respectively. A stainless steel collimator provides a field-of-view of 6$^\circ$ $\times$ 6$^\circ$ optimized to limit the off-axis response while keeping the design within the instrument mass constraints. The in-house designed low-noise digital pulse processing-based front-end electronics has achieved a spectral resolution of $\approx$ 1 keV at 14 keV (CdTe) and $\approx$ 7 keV at 60 keV (CZT). The instrument is also equipped with processing and power electronics to process the signal, drive the electronics, bias the detectors with required low and high voltages for optimal performance of the overall system. In this article, we present design aspects of the instrument, results from the pre-launch ground-based tests, and the in-orbit operations, which have indicated optimal performance in line with that expected.</description>

Abstract: Solar inertial modes are expected to play important diagnostic and dynamical roles in the Sun's differentially rotating convection zone. The coupling of these modes to the radiative interior is yet to be discussed. We aim to understand the dependence of the modes on the uniformly rotating subadiabatic region below the convection zone, and whether this leads to measurable changes at the surface. We used the Dedalus code to compute the linear eigenmodes in the inertial frequency range in a setup including both the convection zone and the radiative interior down to $0.5 R_\odot$. We imposed free-surface boundary conditions at both radial boundaries. For comparison, we also computed the eigenmodes in a setup restricted to the convection zone. We find that the inclusion of the radiative zone only slightly modifies the frequencies and the eigenfunctions at the surface, excluding some modes with significant radial motions (high-frequency retrograde and prograde columnar modes). On the other hand, most modes penetrate significantly into the overshooting layer below the convection zone, which significantly reduces the growth rate of the modes and distorts their eigenfunctions near the base of the convection zone. Furthermore, the uniformly rotating subadiabatic radiative zone supports oscillations due to Rossby modes of all possible spherical harmonics and radial nodes. In particular, when the nearest inertial mode in frequency space lies within around 10 nHz and shares the same north-south symmetry, these Rossby modes evolve into mixed modes characterized by significant motions within both the radiative and convection zones. However, such mixed modes have a large mode mass in the radiative interior and thus will be difficult to excite stochastically by convection.</description>

      <title>Evolution Models of CO WD -- AGB Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common envelope evolution is a critical but still poorly understood phase in binary evolution. It plays a key role in forming close binaries such as hot subdwarfs, double white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and double neutron stars. However, its outcomes remain highly uncertain. Depending on the efficiency of envelope ejection, a system may either survive as a close binary or undergo a complete merger. In this work, we investigate the post merger evolution of systems where a CO WD mergers with the core of an AGB star. A grid of merger remnant models with various core and envelope masses is constructed. At the onset of evolution, the CO core contracts and undergoes off-center carbon ignition, producing an inwardly propagating carbon flame. For remnants with relatively low mass of CO core, the flame phase is followed by core contraction and subsequent H-shell burning. For more massive CO cores, the carbon flame reaches the center and is soon followed by off-center neon burning, which is expected to eventually lead to core-collapse supernovae. The merger remnants occupy nearly the same region on HR diagram as ordinary AGB or super-AGB stars, exhibiting similar surface properties. Although their surface abundance may differ slightly from those of normal AGB stars depending on the initial core and envelope masses, these differences are strongly reduced once mass-loss is taken into account. We suggest that some giant-like stars, including candidates for Thorne-Zytkow objects (e.g., HV 2112), might alternatively be explained as AGB-WD merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Rotational evolution of slow-rotator sequence stars. II. Modeling the wind braking and the rotational coupling in the entire mass range of solar-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, ground- and space-based photometric surveys have characterized the rotational evolution of solar-like stars to an unprecedented level of detail. In this work we focus on the slow-rotator sequence, an emergent feature recognizable in the color-period diagram of Galactic open clusters. Understanding the evolution of this sequence is a promising avenue to formulate a robust rotation period-mass-age relation, which can be used to estimate stellar ages. Our model of the rotational evolution of stars on the slow-rotator sequence takes into account magnetized wind braking and the rotational decoupling between the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This decoupling naturally develops as the internal redistribution of angular momentum lags behind the loss of angular momentum at the stellar surface, and is parameterized in the model by a rotational coupling timescale. Using literature data on rotation and membership of stars in a selection of open clusters of age between 100 Myr and 4 Gyr, we constrain the mass dependence of the two competing processes of wind braking at the surface and angular momentum transport in the interior. Consistently with our previous findings, our best-fitting model requires a mass-dependent coupling timescale; this result is insensitive to the details of the wind braking model used. We show that the mass dependence of the coupling timescale follows a broken power-law in the entire solar-like mass range (0.4-1.25 Msun), with the exponent change occurring at ~ 0.6 Msun. At the same time, our approach can be used to infer semi-empirically the mass dependence of the wind braking model that best fits the observational constraints. Based on our findings, we propose a novel wind braking law with a particularly simple mass term, directly proportional to the moment of inertia of the convective envelope of the star.</description>

      <title>WZ Sge-type dwarf novae: an extreme laboratory in cataclysmic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WZ Sge-type dwarf novae form one of the most intriguing classes of compact accreting binaries. They are recognized as the most evolved population of hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables. Yet they exhibit energetic disk-powered outbursts with an amplitude of 6-9 mag, duration of a month, and decade-long outburst cycles. Despite the dramatic increase in the number of WZ Sge stars over the last decades, there are many unresolved questions, both in terms of their binary evolution and outburst mechanism. In this proceeding paper, I review the recent studies on WZ Sge stars, focusing on their outbursts. Recent observations, both photometrically and spectroscopically, have found the absence of enhanced emission from the hotspot during the early outburst rise in WZ Sge stars, casting doubt on the occurrence of the enhanced mass transfer. Meanwhile, several WZ Sge stars are newly suggested to harbor a magnetic white dwarf, inferring an inner disk truncation in quiescence. Diversity among systems has been discovered: a WZ Sge star with superoutbursts both accompanying and lacking an early superhump phase, one possibly harboring an ONe and massive white dwarf, and one showing optical spectra strongly affected by disk winds. I introduce the connections of WZ Sge stars to period bouncers, helium-rich AM CVn stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries. Finally, prospects of WZ Sge stars in the upcoming time-domain surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory LSST, are presented.</description>

      <title>VLBI astrometry of radio stars to link radio and optical celestial reference frames III: 11 radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment between the radio-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF) is critical for multi-waveband astronomy, yet systematic offsets at the optical bright end (G&lt;13) limit their consistency. While radio stars offer a potential link between these frames, their utility has been restricted by the scarcity of precise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, reaching a precision level of &lt;1% in the best cases. These new samples greatly contribute to the link between ICRF and Gaia-CRF at the optical bright end.</description>

      <title>Challenging historical novae: AT Cnc (1645), Te-11 (483), and M22 (BC 48) revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connections between novae with shells and historical observations are crucial for astrophysical understanding of long-term evolution of shells and cataclysmic variables. Three of five previously considered links are revisited here: extended features in M22 in BC48, Te-11 in 483, and AT Cnc in 1645. We aim to develop a procedure to check whether these links are credible. Literal translations of the Chinese texts, historically based arguments, and close readings are combined with astrophysics, (peak brightness, decay time estimate, shell age expansion model calculation, etc.). (a) Nandou's second star, near which the BC48 `guest star' was reported, is identified as tau Sgr, not lambda Sgr, far from the M22 location. A nova in M22 would peak at only m=6.4 \pm 1.4 mag, and thus a description as a `blue-white' `melon' does not fit; it was likely a comet. (b) The imprecise position (`Shen['s] east') of the `guest star' in 483, its extended (dipper-like) radiance, and the context speak for a bolide. Considering the new (larger) Gaia distance and small extinction towards Te-11 (outside a cloud), its bi-polar morphology and current expansion velocity point to a planetary nebula; as a nova, the shell expansion age is 1100-2000 yr from detailed supersonic expansion calculations. (c) Most certainly, Mars was meant when the source for 1645 reported `a large star entered Yugui'; the verb implies motion. AT Cnc lies neither in Yugui's asterism box nor in the eponymous lunar mansion range. The fluid drag expansion age of AT Cancri's ejecta is 128-631 yr. All three exact ages are unsubstantiated. True novae or nova shells can be connected to historical records only if the position and object type are plausible. Duration, brightness (light curve), and color (evolution) should fit and could provide more astrophysical insight ...</description>

      <title>Evidence for in situ particle energization during the May-2024 event based on ASPEX instrument on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) structures can alter the geo-effectiveness of the ICME events in myriad ways. Many aspects of these interaction processes are not well-understood till date. Using the energy spectra measured in two mutually orthogonal top hat analyzers (THA 1 and 2), which are part of the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) subsystem of the Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on board India's Aditya L1 mission, we gain insights into intricate features of ICME ICME interactions during May 2024 solar event. We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of spicules in MURaM-ChE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of the solar chromosphere have progressed towards reproducing spicules, which are transient features observed at the solar limb using spectral lines such as H$\alpha$, Ca II H&amp;K, or Mg II h&amp;k. Two types of spicules, referred to as types I and II, have been identified in observations and studied in previous numerical works. The statistics of type II spicules in 3D numerical simulations have not yet been studied. We aim to compare the statistics of properties such as lengths, lifetimes, widths, heights, inclinations, and maximum velocities of self-consistently formed spicules in a MURaM-ChE simulation with observations. We employ a H$\alpha$ proxy to identify fine-scale structures at the solar limb resembling spicules in a simulation of an enhanced network region. We track the evolution of 58 such features found in a 21-minute time sequence, and compare their dynamical and morphological properties with those derived from quiet-Sun observations using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode mission in the Ca II H spectral line. Previous studies have shown that spicules show very similar properties in Ca II H and H$\alpha$. The spicule-like structures found in the simulation have statistical properties which are broadly consistent with those observed with Hinode/SOT. In particular, we find evidence for the self-consistent formation of both type I and type II spicules within the simulation, even in the absence of ambipolar diffusion. We also investigate the properties of rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs) in the simulation in relation to the spicules.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Particle Energy Gain During Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The factors that control the maximum energy attained by protons and electrons during magnetic reconnection are investigated analytically and using large-scale simulations with the \textit{kglobal} model. Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy.</description>

      <title>Citizen CATE 2024: Extending Totality During the 8 April 2024 Total Solar Eclipse with a Distributed Network of Community Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Citizen CATE 2024 next-generation experiment placed 43 identical telescope and camera setups along the path of totality during the total solar eclipse (TSE) on 8 April 2024 to capture a 60-minute movie of the inner and middle solar corona in polarized visible light. The 2024 TSE path covered a large geographic swath of North America and we recruited and trained 36 teams of community participants ("citizen scientists") representative of the various communities along the path of totality. Afterwards, these teams retained the equipment in their communities for ongoing education and public engagement activities. Participants ranged from students (K12, undergraduate, and graduate), educators, and adult learners to amateur and professional astronomers. In addition to equipment for their communities, CATE 2024 teams received hands-on telescope training, educational and learning materials, and instruction on data analysis techniques. CATE 2024 used high-cadence, high-dynamic-range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the solar corona to characterize the physical processes that shape its heating, structure, and evolution at scales and sensitivities that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. Conventional eclipse observations do not span sufficient time to capture changing coronal topology, but the extended observation from CATE 2024 does. Analysis of the fully calibrated dataset will provide deeper insight and understanding into these critical physical processes. We present an overview of the CATE 2024 project, including how we engaged local communities along the path of totality, and the first look at CATE 2024 data products from the 2024 TSE.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning models for forecasting solar flares have been trained and tested using a variety of data sources, such as Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) operational and science-quality data. Typically, data from these sources is minimally processed before being used to train and validate a forecasting model. However, predictive performance can be impaired if defects in and inconsistencies between these data sources are ignored. For a number of commonly used data sources, together with softwares that query and then output processed data, we identify their respective defects and inconsistencies, quantify their extent, and show how they can affect the predictions produced by data-driven machine learning forecasting models. We also outline procedures for fixing these issues or at least mitigating their impacts. Finally, based on our thorough comparisons of the impacts of data sources on the trained forecasting model in terms of predictive skill scores, we offer recommendations for the use of different data products in operational forecasting.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field generation in mergers of massive main sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are found in many astrophysical objects, ranging from galaxy clusters to the interstellar medium of galaxies and magnetars. Strong magnetic fields are also observed in massive stars, but it is still unclear how they are generated. There are different theories for their origin: the magnetic fields could be fossil fields from star formation, they could be generated in dynamo processes during stellar evolution, or they could be generated during a merger of two stars. Here, we show how magnetic fields are generated in simulations of mergers of massive main-sequence stars, conducted with the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO. In these simulations, a $9\,M_\odot$ and a $8\,M_\odot$ main sequence star merge, whereby the more massive star transfers mass to the less massive one until it is finally disrupted, forming a core--disk structure. During the initial mass transfer, magnetic fields start to be amplified in the accretion stream, saturating after the disruption at an equipartition level. Correspondingly, the magnetic energy starts being present at small scales, growing to larger scales during the merger. During the merger, the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure, thus the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields on the merger is small. After the merger, both are similar in some regions and the magnetic field shows a large-scale structure that is mostly toroidal and that is expected to be stable. Thus, our simulations show that magnetic fields in massive stars can originate from a merger of two main sequence stars.</description>

      <title>The stellar to sub-stellar masses transition in 47 Tuc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The study of the Globular Cluster 47 Tuc offers the opportunity to shed new light on the debated issue on the presence of multiple populations in Globular Clusters, as recent results from HST photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy outlined star-to-star differences in the surface chemical composition.
  Aims: The goal of the present investigation is the interpretation of recent JWST data of the low main sequence of 47 Tuc, in order to explore the stellar to sub-stellar transition, to derive the mass distribution of the individual sources and to disentangle stars from different populations.
  Methods: Stellar evolution modelling of low-mass stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.78 and oxygen content [O/Fe]=+0.4 and [O/Fe]=0 is used to simulate the evolution of the first and the second generation of the cluster. The comparison between the calculated sequences with the data points is used to characterize the individual objects, to split the different stellar components and to infer the current mass function of the cluster.
  Results: The first generation of 47 Tuc harbours 45 % of the overall population of the cluster, the remaining 55 % making up the second generation. The transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar domain is found at $0.074 M_{\odot}$ and $0.07 M_{\odot}$ for the first and second generations, respectively. The mass function of both the stellar generations are consistent with a Kroupa-like profile down to $0.22 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Overtone Spectroscopy of HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotationally resolved spectra of the HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$ molecular ions have been recorded in the spectral range between 6200 and 6800 \rcm\ using a cryogenic ion trap instrument. The rovibrational transitions were probed using two different action spectroscopy schemes, namely laser-induced reaction (LIR) and leak-out spectroscopy (LOS). Various vibrational bands of HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$ were measured with high resolution for the first time. For HNC$^+$, the $\text{X}~^2\Sigma^+~(20^00)-(00^00)$ overtone band was recorded using LIR, while LOS was used to probe the $\text{X}~^2\Pi~(000)^1-(210)^0\mu$ combination band and the $\text{X}~^2\Pi~(000)^1-\text{A}~^2\Sigma^+~(10^00)$ vibronic band of HCN$^+$. Spectroscopic constants, band origins and radiative lifetimes for the observed states have been determined. The effective fit for the HCN$^+$ spectra revealed the presence of strong vibrational couplings leading to perturbations of the rovibrational levels of the excited states. The two action spectroscopy schemes are compared and their potential use to explore ion-molecule interactions is discussed.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the white dwarf in the eclipsing polar HU Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-speed u- and r-band photometry of the eclipsing polar HU Aquarii that was obtained with ULTRACAM mounted on the VLT. The observations were performed during a low state, permitting us for the first time to determine the contact points of the white dwarf. Using LCURVE we could determine its size, and hence mass, with a direct method and with unprecedented accuracy. We determined the mass of the white dwarf as 0.78 +- 0.02 Msun, the mass ratio Q= MWD / Msec = 4.59, and the orbital inclination i=87.4 +- 0.9. An extended warm region with a central temperature of ~33,000 K was observed in the u-band at the location of the previous high-state accretion spot. Weak accretion was ongoing in the low state that led to cyclotron emission that could best be studied with the r-band data. It has a diameter of only 3deg to 4deg and is located much closer to the binary meridian than the accretion-heated region studied in the u-band. The longitudinal shift of the two accretion regions is of order 30deg, due to early and late coupling of accreted matter onto the magnetic field lines in low and high accretion states, respectively. The low-state cyclotron-emitting region has a vertical extent of 0.005 - 0.016 Rwd, a value that seems to be correlated to the instantaneous accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Tides in Massive Binaries: Numerical Solutions and Semi-Analytical Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison between the tidal secular evolution timescales predicted by the direct numerical method and those given by the commonly used semi-analytic prescriptions implemented in 1-D hydrostatic binary evolution codes. Our study focuses on binary systems with intermediate- to high-mass primaries ($M_1 = 5$-$50\,M_\odot$), companion masses between $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $10\,M_\odot$, and orbital periods ranging from 0.5 to 50 days. Before mass transfer, both approaches predict synchronization and orbital decay timescales that agree within $\sim$2 orders of magnitude and typically exceed the stellar main sequence lifetime, implying negligible tidal impact on secular orbital evolution. However, the implied dissipation channels differ, and the differences become more pronounced once mass transfer begins. To test the theoretical predictions against observations, we apply both approaches to the well-characterized PSR J0045--7319 system, which has an orbital decay timescale of 0.5 Myr. The numerical solution reveals strong resonances with internal gravity waves, bringing the predicted orbital period change rate close to the observed value. In contrast, the semi-analytic prescriptions predict orbital decay timescales longer than the Hubble time. These results suggest that for population studies, modestly calibrated parameterized equations may suffice, but for individual systems, reliable interpretation requires direct numerical approaches.</description>

      <title>Tales of stellar and binary co-evolution, told by stellar oscillations -- Binary demographics and their impact on stellar mass, orbits, and age estimates in main-sequence and red-giant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red giants are increasingly used as stellar population tracers due to their well-understood evolution and the availability of asteroseismic observables. However, stellar binarity can alter observable properties and introduce strong biases. We aim to provide a holistic picture of the binary population and its evolution in the red giant phase by characterizing a sample of binaries hosting oscillating red giants from a combination of extensive asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric surveys. We investigate the binary properties of evolved stars in the APOKASC3 and APO-K2 catalogs, leveraging asteroseismic constraints and Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions. We explore the mass distribution of red-giant binary systems and analyze the evolution of their binary fraction. For stars with M$\leq$1.8M$_\odot$, we find binary fractions $\sim$31% and $\sim$41% for oscillating and non-oscillating solar-like stars on the main-sequence (MS). By the power excess ($\nu_\mathrm{max}$) as luminosity proxy, we detect a binary attrition of $\sim$69% and $\sim$81% on the low- and high-luminosity red-giant branch (RGB) and an additional $\sim$38% to the red clump (RC), with respect to the MS. Binaries hosting RC and secondary clump stars (2RC) stars are largely depleted at $P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim$500 and $\lesssim$200 days, respectively. Mass-dependent differences in binary fractions and orbital properties point to more substantial binary attrition for stars with M $\leq$1.8 M$_\odot$. The distinct mass distributions and the depletion of short-period binaries during the red-giant phase underscore the impact of stellar expansion and binary interactions on stellar evolution. RC systems with $P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim$800 to 1,000 days are likely shaped by past interactions, such as mass transfer or loss, which can lead to significantly biased age estimates if not accounted for.</description>

      <title>Evolution of solar and stellar coronal abundances due to magnetic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the evolution of solar coronal element abundances over an active region lifetime. Magneto-convection drives the complexity of magnetic fields that emerge above the photosphere. This complexity is dissipated, together with that of the overlying pre-existing fields, through dynamic events such as flares. A period of stable "ordinary" coronal heating ensues, before the concentrated fields are dissipated through interactions with the surrounding environment. The evolution of coronal abundances can be explained by the First Ionisation Potential (FIP) effect operating within this framework. We extend the discussion from magnetic activity on timescales of active region lifetimes (months), to the solar cycle (years), and stellar evolution (eons). The broad picture shows intriguing similarities that may prompt new investigations.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating equilibrium with slow steady flow and the correct form of entropy current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with spherical symmetry as well as with steady energy flow is investigated perturbatively around the hydrostatic limit, where the radial component of the fluid velocity field $u^\mu$ is sufficiently small. Each component of vectors and tensors consisting of the system is expanded in different powers, which makes the covariant perturbation approach ineffective. The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^\mu$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^\mu$ in such a general covariant form that $s^\mu=au^\mu+ bj^\mu$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^\mu=(s-bj^0)u^\mu/u^0+ bj^\mu$, where $s$ is the entropy density. The remaining parameter $b$ is fixed by the current conservation equation. The perturbative analysis shows that $b$ starts with the quadratic order and its leading term is determined explicitly.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Binaries Accreting from Thin Disks: Orbital Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary disks crucially affect the orbital and electromagnetic properties of binary systems across the universe, from stars in our galactic neighborhood to supermassive black hole binaries formed as the result of tumultuous galactic mergers. Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $\alpha$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries.</description>

      <title>The Brown-dwarf Desert Persists as a Mass-ratio Desert around Low-mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sun-like stars are known to host a paucity of brown dwarf companions at close separations. Direct imaging surveys of intermediate-mass stars have suggested that the brown dwarf desert may be fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio. Microlensing surveys provide a unique opportunity to investigate the nature of this desert around low mass stars, as microlensing hosts have typical masses of 0.05-0.8 $M_\odot$. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of homogeneously selected binary-lens microlensing events in the literature, and identify a companion mass-ratio desert at $0.02\lesssim q\lesssim0.05$ and projected separations around 1-5 au. We derive a statistically significant truncation to the giant-planet mass-ratio distribution at $q\simeq0.02$, above which the occurrence rate density drops by approximately an order of magnitude. Due to the possibility that the small number of detected companions in this desert orbit white dwarfs, this mass-ratio desert may be closer to being completely dry around main-sequence stars. Below this desert, we derive a giant-planet ($q&gt;4\times10^{-4}$) occurrence rate density of $5.8\pm0.8$% per decade of projected separation. Our analysis furthers the hypothesis that the brown dwarf desert is fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio, separating distinct populations of planetary and non-planetary companions that are likely formed via core accretion and gravitational instability, respectively. The persistence of this desert across stellar types suggests that both gas-giant planets and sub-stellar companions form in a scale-invariant fashion, with planets growing to a maximum of approximately 2% their host masses.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Detects Warm CO Emission in the Terrestrial-Planet Zone of HD 131488</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have obtained a high-resolution, JWST NIRSpec $2.87$ -- $5.14$ $\mu$m spectrum of the debris disk around HD 131488. We discover CO fundamental emission indicating the presence of warm fluorescent gas within $\sim10$ AU of the star. The large discrepancy in CO's vibrational and rotational temperature indicates that CO is out of thermal equilibrium and is excited with UV fluorescence. Our UV fluorescence model gives a best fit of $1150\,$K with an effective temperature of $450$, $332$, and $125\,$K for the warm CO gas kinetic temperature within $0.5$, $1$, and $10\,$AU to the star and a gas vibrational temperature of $8800\,$K. The newly discovered warm CO gas population likely resides between sub-AU scales and $\sim\,10\,$AU, interior to the cold CO reservoir detected beyond $35\,$AU with HST STIS and ALMA. The discovery of warm, fluorescent gas in a debris disk is the first such detection ever made. The detection of warm CO raises the possibility of unseen molecules (H$_2$O, H$_2$, etc) as collisional partners to excite the warm gas. We estimated a lower mass limit for CO of $1.25\times 10^{-7}\text{M}_{\oplus}$, which is $10^{-5}$ of the cold CO mass detected with ALMA and HST. We demonstrate that UV fluorescence emerges as a promising avenue for detecting tenuous gas at $10^{-7}$ Earth-mass level in debris disks with JWST.</description>

      <title>The maximum offsets of binary neutron star mergers from host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically derive, and illustrate with a population synthesis model, the maximum offset of binary neutron star mergers ejected from their host galaxies. This approximate maximum offset is 300 kpc $\times\ (v_\mathrm{esc} / 500\ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-7}$, where $v_\mathrm{esc}$ is the escape velocity from the host galaxy. Massive hosts with high escape velocities are unlikely to yield very large offsets. This maximum offset should inform the host associations of mergers that are not coincident with galaxies. We also discuss potential correlations between offsets and system masses, and possibly the duration of the gamma-ray burst accompanying the merger.</description>

Abstract: The millihertz band is densely populated by continuous gravitational-wave signals from Galactic compact binaries, dominated by double white dwarfs (DWDs; binaries of two white dwarfs) with contributions from systems containing neutron stars and black holes (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.</description>

      <title>The macroscopic precession model: describing quasi-periodic oscillations including internal structures of test bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic precession model (RPM) is widely-considered as a benchmark framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), albeit several observational inconsistencies suggest that the model remains incomplete. The RPM ensures \emph{structureless test particles} and attributes precession to geodesic motion alone. Here, we refine the RPM by incorporating the internal structure of rotating test bodies, while preserving the test particle approximation (TPA), and propose a \emph{macroscopic precession model} (MPM) by means of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, applied to a Schwarzschild background, which introduces 1) a shift in the Keplerian frequency and 2) an \emph{effective spin correction} to the radial epicyclic frequency that, once the spin tensor is modeled, reproduces a quasi-Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) correction. We apply the MPM to eight neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs), performing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits to twin kHz QPOs and find observational and statistical evidence in favor of precise power law spin reconstructions. Further, our model accurately predicts the $3:2$ frequency clustering, the disk boundaries and the NS masses. From the MPM model, we thus conclude that complexity of QPOs can be fully-described including the test particle internal structure.</description>

      <title>On the use of polarized thermal emission to constrain cloud grain size and temperature structure of sub-stellar objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for probing the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets, but interpretations based on flux spectra alone often suffer from degeneracies among temperature structure, chemical composition, and cloud properties. Thermal emission spectropolarimetry offers complementary sensitivity to these atmospheric characteristics. Previous studies have shown that linear polarization in fixed bandpasses depends on emission angle, temperature profile, and cloud scattering. In this study, we revisit these dependencies, emphasizing the wavelength-dependent effects that shape polarized spectra. We show that thermal polarization spectrum is primarily governed by: (1) a combination of temperature, temperature gradient, and wavelength; (2) cloud particle size; and (3) cloud optical thickness. Using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTES, we simulate polarization spectra from a modeled 1D atmosphere. We find that, for a fixed cloud optical thickness, the polarization exhibits peaks at size parameters near 0.2 and 1. However, the dependence on cloud optical thickness is more pronounced and tends to dominate the broadband polarization. We further show that much narrower polarization features in molecular absorption band, can in principle trace the local temperature gradient at the photosphere of each wavelength. Future low-resolution (resolving power around 100) spectropolarimeter operating at 1-2 micron with sensitivities of 1e-5 would be able to capture these polarization features, and may provide a new diagnostic for breaking degeneracies that commonly affect flux-only retrievals. This work represents an incremental step toward the challenging goal of jointly interpreting atmosphere from both intensity and polarization spectra.</description>

      <title>First mapping of prebiotic molecule CH2NH in a pre-stellar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first spatially resolved map of methanimine CH2NH in the prestellar core L1544 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The 2$_{0,2}$-1$_{0,1}$ line at 127 GHz was mapped with 20" resolution ($\sim$2800 au), revealing extended CH2NH emission across the core. The peak line intensity coincides with the well-known c-C3H2 peak, while the integrated intensity peaks between the HNCO and dust continuum peaks due to broader linewidths in the latter region. Column densities of CH2NH are $\sim$(0.5-1.4$\times$)10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to fractional abundances of $5\times10^{-11}$-$1\times10^{-10}$, with a trend decreasing from the southern, carbon-chain rich region to the dust and HNCO peak in the north. Comparison with complementary molecular maps and the gas-grain chemical model of Sipil\"a et al. suggests that neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions and dissociative recombination dominate in the outer carbon-chain shell. This study demonstrates that CH2NH, a simple nitrogen- and carbon-bearing molecule previously detected with pointed observations in other cold cores, is present and spatially extended in the evolved pre-stellar core L1544. This indicates that prebiotic nitrogen-carbon chemistry continues efficiently up to the onset of gravitational collapse, providing key constraints for astrochemical models and the early stages of chemical complexity leading to amino acids.</description>

      <title>Toward the time-domain spectroscopic study of the dynamic life of stars: from accretion to magnetic activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets can be seen as the second fundamental building blocks of baryons in the universe (only second to the dust and gas in molecular clouds). Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>Transients as Determinants of Habitability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity, manifested through spots (faculae and flares), fundamentally shapes the exoplanets' environments. For low-mass stars in particular, where most habitable-zone planets reside, the variable magnetic phenomena can dominate atmospheric chemistry, surface radiation levels, long-term atmospheric escape, and ultimately habitability. However, physical characteristics of these transients (e.g. energy and temperature) and their spectra remain ill-constrained due to limitations in cadence and magnitude access of current spectroscopic facilities. A next-generation 12-m class ground-based observatory equipped with integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at R$\sim$4,000 and $\sim$40,000 offers a transformational opportunity to characterize stellar activity in the time domain across large samples of exoplanet host stars. Such a facility would enable simultaneous monitoring of continuum variability, chromospheric and coronal line diagnostics, and particle-accelerated flare signatures, resolving the physics driving space weather and quantifying its impact on planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solitary Alfv\'en wave model that exhibits nontrivial three-dimensional twisting of open magnetic field lines while preserving constant $|B|$. Embedded rotational discontinuities sharply deflect the otherwise uniform field lines, producing localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the ``switchbacks'' observed by the Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. This indicates that switchbacks, as seen in one-dimensional spacecraft time series, arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey XI. Unraveling the chemical composition of the bulge globular cluster NGC 6304</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. With CAPOS, we can mitigate the observational difficulties limiting access to bulge globular clusters in the optical and investigate them in more detail in the near-IR. Aims. To perform a rigorous abundance analysis of the metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6304, in order to determine its detailed chemical composition and identify multiple populations. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-IR spectra of 27 giant members. The abundances of 17 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Ce) were derived using the BACCHUS code, using atmospheric parameters from both ASPCAP and photometry (Gaia and 2MASS). Results. We derived $[{\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\pm0.05$ using the ASPCAP parameters, and $[{\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\pm0.08$ when using photometric parameters, with no evidence of an intrinsic metallicity spread. NGC 6304 shows $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]_{\rm spec} = 0.24\pm0.07$ and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]_{\rm phot} = 0.23\pm0.08$. We find a significant spread in $[{\rm N/Fe}]$, with $\sigma_{\rm spec} = 0.54$ and $\sigma_{\rm phot} = 0.46$, along with a C-N anticorrelation. Furthermore, we detect a correlation of Ce with both N and Al, consistent with patterns observed in some metal-rich bulge globular clusters. Conclusions. We find a significant star-to-star variation in Na, but a minimal variation in O. The absence of the Mg-Al anticorrelation supports the evidence that the MgAl cycle is not active in globular clusters at high metallicity. The observed correlation between Ce and both N and Al suggests that the enrichment of these elements may be driven by asymptotic giant branch stars, positioning Ce as an element involved in multiple populations in metal-rich globular clusters. We find that abundances are consistent with those of bulge field stars of similar metallicity, suggesting a similar origin and chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion detection of a wobbling high-latitude jet in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations of the detection of a faint high-latitude jet in the inner coma of comet 3I/ATLAS that coincides with the broad plume detected in visible images along PA $280 \pm 10^{\circ}$. A detailed analysis shows that the jet was clearly detected on seven nights (2025, August~3, 5, 18, 19, 21, 24, and~29). The jet maintains an almost, though not perfectly, constant position angle (PA) throughout these epochs. High-precision PA measurements at a projected distance of 6000~km from the cometary optocenter reveal a periodic modulation centered at ~ 280 degrees, consistent with a high-latitude jet undergoing precessional motion around the sky-projected spin axis of the nucleus. This is the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar comet. The derived periodicity of $7.74 \pm 0.35$ h may imply a nucleus rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 15.48 \pm 0.70$ h if the jet originates from a single active source near one of the poles. This value is slightly shorter than the period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 16.79 \pm 0.23$ h derived from the photometric time series. From the measured PA range, the sky-projected orientation of the spin axis is derived as $\mathrm{PA} = 280.7 \pm 0.2^{\circ}$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this project we use data obtained by Zwicky Transient Facility to develop and test a neural-network-based, multiband classification algorithm to classify periodic variable stars (i.e. pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries). The aim is to utilize the algorithm on LSST data once they become available. Phase-folded light curve images and period information were used from five different variable star types: Classical and Type II Cepheids, {\delta} Scuti stars, eclipsing binaries, and RR Lyrae stars. The data is taken from the 17th data release of ZTF, from which we used two passbands, g and r in this project. The periods were calculated from the raw data and this information was used as an additional numerical input in the neural network. For the training and testing process a supervised machine learning method was created, the neural network contains Convolutional Neural Networks concatenated with Fully Connected Layers.
  During the training-validation process the training accuracy reached 99% and the validation accuracy peaked at 95.6%. At the test classification phase three variable star types out of the 5 classes were classified with around 99% of accuracy, the other two also had very high accuracy, 89.6% and 93.6%.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Early Milky Way with Globular Clusters: The Diagnostic Power of Neutron-Capture Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental tracers of the early assembly of the Milky Way (MW). They formed in diverse environments -- including both our Galaxy and dwarf galaxies -- retaining chemical and dynamical signatures that encode their origins and the merger history of the Galaxy. Although significant progress has been made in characterising GC chemistry, most studies have focused on light, $\alpha$-, and iron-peak elements. In contrast, neutron-capture (n-capture) elements remain sparsely investigated across the GC system, despite their unique ability to trace nucleosynthetic channels and star-formation timescales. A homogeneous and statistically robust mapping of n-process elements in a large sample of GCs would provide powerful constraints on their formation environments, chemical signatures of in situ and accreted systems, and refine our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the MW halo. Addressing this gap requires high-resolution, multiplexing, and blue-sensitive spectroscopy capable of accessing the full suite of n-capture diagnostics in several tens of stars per GC.</description>

Abstract: Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered group of hot pulsating stars whose evolutionary status remains uncertain. Their supposed progenitors are either $\simeq 0.3M_{\odot}$ shell H-burning stars or $\simeq 1.0M_{\odot}$ core He-burning stars, both relying on mass loss or a merger event in a (rarely observed) close interacting binary system. With the goal to understand the stellar masses of BLAPs, we therefore carried out a linear non-adiabatic analysis of a grid of models computed using mesa-rsp, with appropriate input stellar parameters $ZXMLT_{\rm eff}$ and convection parameter sets. We discuss the impact of stellar mass, metallicity, helium abundance and convection parameters on the theoretical instability regions of BLAPs. We also derive new theoretical period relations; our theoretical period relations using low stellar masses seem to be in better agreement with the observed period relations. Although only two BLAPS have been observed to be multi-periodic oscillator so far, we analyse theoretical $P_{1O}/P_F$ ratios and compare these values with other classical pulsators. Furthermore, we provide the first asteroseismic mass estimate for the triple-mode pulsator, OGLE-BLAP-030 which seems to be well-constrained in the range of $0.62-0.64 M_{\odot}$ with a high metallicity of $Z=0.07$, albeit with a few sources of uncertainty involved. This would place the BLAP star intermediate to the two proposed mass scenarios so far.</description>

Abstract: Coronagraph observations provide key information about the orientation of the Sun's magnetic field. Previous studies used various algorithms to segment quasi-radial features in coronagraph images and approximate their local plane-of-sky geometry and orientation which can be used as input for optimizing and constraining coronal magnetic field models. We present a new framework that allows for further quantitative evaluations of image-based coronal segmentation methods against magnetic field models, and vice-versa. We compare quasi-radial features identified from QRaFT, a global coronal feature tracing algorithm, in white-light coronagraph images to outputs of MAS, an advanced magnetohydrodynamic model. We use the FORWARD toolset to produce synthetic polarized brightness images co-aligned to real coronagraph observations, segment features in these images, and quantify the difference between the inferred and model magnetic field. This approach allows us to geometrically compare features segmented in artificial images to those segmented in white-light coronagraph observations against the plane-of-sky projected MAS coronal magnetic field. We quantify QRaFT's performance in the artificial images and observational data, and perform statistical analyses that measure the accuracy and uncertainty of the model output to the observational data. The results demonstrate that a coronal segmentation method identifies the global large-scale orientation of the coronal magnetic field within $\sim\pm10^\circ$ of the plane-of-sky projected MAS magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Two Decades of Dust Evolution in SN 2005af through JWST, Spitzer, and Chemical Modeling</title>

Abstract: The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust formed in the ejecta, with a total mass of at least 0.02 Msun. In the circumstellar medium, the surviving oxygen-rich dust amounts to about 0.003-0.006 Msun, yielding a total dust mass of at least 0.025 Msun.</description>

      <title>Very Large Telescope Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS. II. From Quiescence to Glow: Dramatic Rise of Ni i Emission and Incipient CN Outgassing at Large Heliocentric Distances*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report VLT spectroscopy of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025~N1) from $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!4.4$ to $2.85$~au using X-shooter (300--550\,nm, $R\!\simeq\!3000$) and UVES (optical, $R\!\simeq\!35k-80k$). The coma is dust-dominated with a fairly constant red optical continuum slope ($\sim$21--22\%/1000\AA). We report detection of CN emission and also detect numerous Ni\,\textsc{ii}~lines while Fe\,\textsc{i}~remains undetected, potentially implying efficiently released gas-phase Ni. At $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!3.14$~au we derive $3\sigma$ limits of $Q({\rm OH})&lt;{1.48\times10^{26}}\ {\rm s^{-1}}$, but find no indications for [O\,\textsc{i}], C$_2$, C$_3$ or NH$_2$. From our latest X-shooter measurements conducted on 2025-08-21 ($r_{\rm h} = 2.85$\,au) we measure production rates of $\log~Q(\mathrm{CN}) = {24.81\pm 0.01}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and $\log~Q$(Ni) $= {23.30\pm0.07}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and characterize their evolution as the comet approaches perihelion.~We observe a steep heliocentric-distance scaling for the production rates $Q(\mathrm{Ni}) \propto r_h^{{-7.7 \pm 1.0}}$ and for $Q(\mathrm{CN}) \propto r_h^{{-6.7 \pm 0.2}}$, and predict a Ni--CO$_{(2)}$ correlation if the Ni\,\textsc{ii}\ emission is driven by the carbonyl formation channel.~Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low--activation--energy release from dust, e.g.~photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni--carbonyl-like complexes.~These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the dominant waves in the extended solar corona</title>

Abstract: The extended solar corona at 10-30 solar radii is essentially devoid of all waves below 100 kHz other than triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), which consist of a low frequency electromagnetic wave at a frequency of a few Hz coupled to one or more electrostatic waves at a few hundred Hz, such that the amplitudes of the higher frequency waves peak at a fixed phase of each low frequency wave period. All the waves in a TIAW event travel at the same phase speed, which is found to be 150 km/sec (the ion acoustic speed was about 100 km/sec). It has not been possible to explain the TIAW as a resonant wave-wave interaction, so a non-resonant interaction has been considered in which the loss of energy by the low frequency wave is used to both heat the electrons and grow the higher frequency waves. Evidence in support of this explanation is described and a PIC simulation that discusses this process is summarized. This simulation demonstrates wave-particle interactions driven by the enhanced LF fluctuations, which subsequently modify the proton VDF and create conditions favorable for the growth of HF waves. This interplay between a pair of waves, mediated by modifications of plasma parameters and energy conversion, represents a significant nonlinear process in plasma physics, the study of which will deepen the understanding of energy transfer, wave generation, and plasma dynamics in diverse astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stellar Parameters of Massive Stars from Light Curves with Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of OB stars are important for understanding processes like stellar evolution, but require labor-intensive observations. In contrast, photometric missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) can monitor hundreds of thousands of stars with a range of temporal resolutions, but do not provide such detailed measurements. With surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time promising unprecedented photometric coverage over the next ten years, it is increasingly important to develop methods that connect large-scale time-series photometry with the detailed stellar parameter measurements typically derived from spectroscopy. In this paper, we test whether machine learning can recover such parameters by combining TESS light curves with spectroscopic measurements from the IACOB project, using a sample of 285 light curves from 106 unique O stars. Using both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that (1) O star light curves contain sufficient information to meaningfully infer stellar parameters and (2) periodograms derived from light curves capture substantially more information than previously identified correlation parameters. Our best model achieves moderate success in predicting both spectroscopic luminosity ($R^2 = 0.641_{-0.167}^{+0.107}$) and effective temperature ($R^2 = 0.443_{-0.234}^{+0.056}$), key stellar parameters for determining positions of stars on the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, despite the small dataset size. Further progress will require expanded datasets of matched photometric and spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>The EBLM project XVI. Moderate spin-orbit misalignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16</title>

Abstract: Thousands of tight ($&lt;1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry and a measured primary star rotation period of 7.04 days, according to star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is misaligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=28.9\pm2.1^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16, being neither spin-orbit aligned nor synchronized, yet with an almost circular orbit, is a curious case for tidal evolution in tight binaries. It becomes one of a handful of eclipsing binaries with true obliquity measurements. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M-dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical models for common envelope evolution (CEE), particularly the energy formalism, are used in binary population synthesis to predict post-CEE configurations. This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which relates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the envelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a multiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal value for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE with RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without corotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the post-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius. This trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and supergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes. Therefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final separation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has been liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial plunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later stages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE observations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our results reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is treated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single event governed by alpha.</description>

Abstract: The paper utilizes data from the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino detection experiment and analyzes them by diffusion entropy analysis and standard deviation analysis to evaluate the scaling exponent of the probability density function. The result indicates that solar neutrinos are subject to Levy flights. Subsequently, the paper derives the probability density function, represented as the Fox H-function, and the governing fractional diffusion equation for solar neutrino Levy flights.</description>

      <title>Probing Proton versus Electron Heating and Energization during Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfv\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR\,J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe PSR J2322-2650b's emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up new exoplanetary chemical (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of &gt;100 and &gt;10,000, respectively) and dynamical regimes (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of ``black widow'' companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.</description>

      <title>HD 143811 AB b: A Directly Imaged Planet Orbiting a Spectroscopic Binary in Sco-Cen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present confirmation of HD 143811 AB b, a substellar companion to spectroscopic binary HD 143811 AB through direct imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Keck NIRC2. HD 143811 AB was observed as a part of the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) in 2016 and 2019 and is a member of the Sco-Cen star formation region. The exoplanet is detected $\sim 430$ mas from the host star by GPI. With two GPI epochs and one from Keck/NIRC2 in 2022, we confirm through common proper motion analysis that the object is bound to its host star. We derive an orbit with a semi-major axis of $64 ^{+32}_{-14}$ au and eccentricity ${0.23 ^{+0.24}_{-0.16}}$. Spectral analysis of the GPI $H$-band spectrum and NIRC2 \textit{L'} photometry provides additional proof that this object is a substellar companion. We compare the spectrum of HD 143811 AB b to PHOENIX stellar models and Exo-REM exoplanet atmosphere models and find that Exo-REM models provide the best fits to the data. From the Exo-REM models, we derive an effective temperature of $1042^{+178}_{-132}$ K for the planet and translate the derived luminosity of the planet to a mass of $5.6 \pm 1.1~M_\textrm{Jup}$ assuming hot-start evolutionary models. HD 143811 AB b is the first directly imaged planet around a binary that is not on an ultra-wide orbit. Future characterization of this object will shed light on the formation of planets around binary star systems.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>

Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $k^{-17/20}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criteria for this process, revealing that young SNR with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>

Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Profiles of 3I/ATLAS CN and Ni Outgassing from Keck/KCWI Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-state-informed pulse profile modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile modeling (PPM), providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Satellite Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.</description>

      <title>Isotopomer-Specific Carbon Isotope Ratio of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10516</link>

Abstract: The recent observation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), along with previous gas-phase detections, underscores the importance of grain surface and ice mantle chemistry in the synthesis of COMs. In this study, we investigate the formation and carbon isotope fractionation of COMs by constructing a new astrochemical reaction network that distinguishes the position of $^{13}$C within species (e.g., H$^{13}$COOCH$_3$ and HCOO$^{13}$CH$_3$ are distinguished). We take into account the position of $^{13}$C in each species in gas and solid phase chemistry. This new model allows us to resolve isotopomer-specific $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs formed in the star-forming cores. We consider thermal diffusion-driven radical-radical reactions on the ice surface and non-thermal radiolysis chemistry in the bulk (surface + mantle) ice. We find that carbon isotope fractionation of the functional groups in COMs appears through both non-thermal radiolysis in cold environments and thermal diffusion in warm environments, depending on the COMs. In particular, COMs containing methyl groups show isotopomer differences in $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios that reflect their formation pathways and environments. These isotopomer-resolved fractionation patterns provide a diagnostic tool to probe the origins of COMs in star-forming cores. Our results suggest that future comparisons between high-sensitivity isotopic observations and isotopomer-specific models will be helpful for constraining the relative contributions of thermal and non-thermal formation processes of COMs.</description>
