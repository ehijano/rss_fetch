      <title>Conformal Prediction for Multi-Source Detection on a Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the origin of information or infection spread in networks is a fundamental challenge with applications in misinformation tracking, epidemiology, and beyond. We study the multi-source detection problem: given snapshot observations of node infection status on a graph, estimate the set of source nodes that initiated the propagation. Existing methods either lack statistical guarantees or are limited to specific diffusion models and assumptions. We propose a novel conformal prediction framework that provides statistically valid recall guarantees for source set detection, independent of the underlying diffusion process or data distribution. Our approach introduces principled score functions to quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and true sources, and leverages a calibration set to construct prediction sets with user-specified recall and coverage levels. The method is applicable to both single- and multi-source scenarios, supports general network diffusion dynamics, and is computationally efficient for large graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves rigorous coverage with competitive accuracy, outperforming existing baselines in both reliability and scalability.The code is available online.</description>

      <title>Iterative Ricci-Foster Curvature Flow with GMM-Based Edge Pruning: A Novel Approach to Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in complex networks is a fundamental problem, open to new approaches in various scientific settings. We introduce a novel community detection method, based on Ricci flow on graphs. Our technique iteratively updates edge weights (their metric lengths) according to their (combinatorial) Foster version of Ricci curvature computed from effective resistance distance between the nodes. The latter computation is known to be done by pseudo-inverting the graph Laplacian matrix. At that, our approach is alternative to one based on Ollivier-Ricci geometric flow for community detection on graphs, significantly outperforming it in terms of computation time. In our proposed method, iterations of Foster-Ricci flow that highlight network regions of different curvature -- are followed by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) separation heuristic. That allows to classify edges into ''strong'' (intra-community) and ''weak'' (inter-community) groups, followed by a systematic pruning of the former to isolate communities. We benchmark our algorithm on synthetic networks generated from the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), evaluating performance with the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). Our results demonstrate that proposed framework robustly recovers the planted community structure of SBM-s, establishing Ricci-Foster Flow with GMM-clustering as a principled and computationally effective new tool for network analysis, tested against alternative Ricci-Ollivier flow coupled with spectral clustering.</description>

      <title>A Spanning-Tree-Based Algorithm for Planar Graph Dismantling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spatially embedded networks such as transportation and power grids, understanding how edge removals affect connectivity is crucial for robustness analysis. This paper studies a planar graph dismantling problem under an edge-budget constraint. We propose a spanning-tree-skeleton dual-path framework that first samples multiple uniform spanning trees to capture network backbones and then adaptively selects between two complementary paths according to the budget. The small-budget path estimates a dismantlable subgraph fraction using a logarithmic density feature, while the large-budget path predicts the optimal partition count through a slope-based model. Experiments on random planar graphs demonstrate near-linear runtime scaling, consistent reductions in the largest connected component ratio, and clear budget-fragmentation trends. The method provides an interpretable and efficient approach for planar-network robustness analysis.</description>

      <title>A Phase Transition for Opinion Dynamics with Competing Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear dynamics of binary opinions in a population of agents connected by a directed network, influenced by two competing forces. On the one hand, agents are stubborn, i.e., have a tendency for one of the two opinions; on the other hand, there is a disruptive bias, $p\in[0,1]$, that drives the agents toward the other opinion. The disruptive bias models external factors, such as market innovations or social controllers, aiming to challenge the status quo, while agents' stubbornness reinforces the initial opinion making it harder for the external bias to drive the process toward change. Each agent updates its opinion according to a nonlinear function of the states of its neighbors and of the bias $p$. We consider the case of random directed graphs with prescribed in- and out-degree sequences and we prove that the dynamics exhibits a phase transition: when the disruptive bias $p$ is larger than a critical threshold $p_c$, the population converges in constant time to a consensus on the disruptive opinion. Conversely, when the bias $p$ is less than $p_c$, the system enters a metastable state in which only a fraction of agents $q_\star(p)&lt;1$ will share the new opinion for a long time. We characterize $p_c$ and $q_\star(p)$ explicitly, showing that they only depend on few simple statistics of the degree sequences. Our analysis relies on a dual system of branching, coalescing, and dying particles, which we show exhibits equivalent behavior and allows a rigorous characterization of the system's dynamics. Our results characterize the interplay between the degree of the agents, their stubbornness, and the external bias, shedding light on the tipping points of opinion dynamics in networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Value Expressions in Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08453</link>

Abstract: The value alignment of sociotechnical systems has become a central debate but progress in this direction requires the measurement of the expressions of values. While the rise of large-language models offer new possible opportunities for measuring expressions of human values (e.g., humility or equality) in social media data, there remain both conceptual and practical challenges in operationalizing value expression in social media posts: what value system and operationalization is most applicable, and how do we actually measure them? In this paper, we draw on the Schwartz value system as a broadly encompassing and theoretically grounded set of basic human values, and introduce a framework for measuring Schwartz value expressions in social media posts at scale. We collect 32,370 ground truth value expression annotations from N=1,079 people on 5,211 social media posts representative of real users' feeds. We observe low levels of inter-rater agreement between people, and low agreement between human raters and LLM-based methods. Drawing on theories of interpretivism - that different people will have different subjective experiences of the same situation - we argue that value expression is (partially) in the eye of the beholder. In response, we construct a personalization architecture for classifying value expressions. We find that a system that explicitly models these differences yields predicted value expressions that people agree with more than they agree with other people. These results contribute new methods and understanding for the measurement of human values in social media data.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Scope Experts at Test: Generalizing Deeper Graph Neural Networks with Shallow Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06998v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs). Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases. Despite having better expressivity, state-of-the-art deeper GNNs achieve only marginal improvements compared to their shallow variants. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate a shift in GNN generalization preferences across nodes with different homophily levels as depth increases. This creates a disparity in generalization patterns between GNN models with varying depth. Based on these findings, we propose to improve deeper GNN generalization while maintaining high expressivity by Mixture of scope experts at test (Moscat). Experimental results show that Moscat works flexibly with various GNNs across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy. Our code is available at (https://github.com/Hydrapse/moscat).</description>

      <title>Mixture of Message Passing Experts with Routing Entropy Regularization for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress in graph-based learning tasks, yet their performance often deteriorates when facing heterophilous structures where connected nodes differ substantially in features and labels. To address this limitation, we propose GNNMoE, a novel entropy-driven mixture of message-passing experts framework that enables node-level adaptive representation learning. GNNMoE decomposes message passing into propagation and transformation operations and integrates them through multiple expert networks guided by a hybrid routing mechanism. And a routing entropy regularization dynamically adjusts soft weighting and soft top-$k$ routing, allowing GNNMoE to flexibly adapt to diverse neighborhood contexts. Extensive experiments on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNNMoE consistently outperforms SOTA node classification methods, while maintaining scalability and interpretability. This work provides a unified and principled approach for achieving fine-grained, personalized node representation learning.</description>
