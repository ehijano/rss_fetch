      <title>Benchmarking spike source localization algorithms in high density probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating neuron location from extracellular recordings is essential for developing advanced brain-machine interfaces. Accurate neuron localization improves spike sorting, which involves detecting action potentials and assigning them to individual neurons. It also helps monitor probe drift, which affects long-term probe reliability. Although several localization algorithms are currently in use, the field is nascent and arguments for using one algorithm over another are largely theoretical or based on visual analysis of clustering results. We present a first-of-its-kind benchmarking of commonly used neuron localization algorithms. We tested these algorithms using two ground truth datasets: a biophysically realistic simulated dataset, and experimental data combining patch-clamp and Neuropixels probes. We systematically evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and runtime of these algorithms in ideal conditions and long-term recording conditions with electrode decay. Our findings highlight significant performance differences; while more complex and physically realistic models perform better in ideal situations, simple heuristics demonstrate superior robustness to noise and electrode degradation in experimental datasets, making them more suitable for long-term neural recordings. This work provides a framework for assessing localization algorithms and developing robust, biologically grounded algorithms to advance the development of brain-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>EEG Blink Artifacts Can Identify Read Music in Listening and Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye-movement related artifacts including blinks and saccades are significantly larger in amplitude than cortical activity as recorded by scalp electroencephalography (EEG), but are typically discarded in EEG studies focusing on cognitive mechanisms as explained by cortical source activity. Accumulating evidence however indicates that spontaneous eye blinks are not necessarily random, and can be modulated by attention and cognition beyond just physiological necessities. In this exploratory analysis we reanalyze a public EEG dataset of musicians listening to or imagining music (Bach chorales) while simultaneously reading from a sheet of music. We ask whether blink timing in reading music, accompanied by listening or imagery, is sufficient to uniquely identify the music being read from a given score. Intra-subject blink counts and timing are compared across trials using a spike train distance metric (Victor and Purpura, 1997). One-trial-left-out cross-validation is used to identify the music being read with above chance level accuracy (best subject: 56\%, chance: 25\%), where accuracy is seen to vary with subject, condition, and a tunable cost factor for time shifts. Future studies may consider incorporating eye blink contributions to brain decoding, especially in wearables where eye blinks could be easier to record than EEG given their higher amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which drives and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.</description>

      <title>Functional Ultrasound Imaging Combined with Machine Learning for Whole-Brain Analysis of Drug-Induced Hemodynamic Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a cutting-edge technology that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) by detecting backscattered echoes from red blood cells moving within its field of view (FOV). It offers high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing for detailed visualization of cerebral blood flow dynamics. While fUSI has been utilized in preclinical drug development studies to explore the mechanisms of action of various drugs targeting the central nervous system, many of these studies rely on predetermined regions of interest (ROIs). This focus may overlook relevant brain activity outside these specific areas, which could influence the results. To address this limitation, we compared three machine learning approaches-convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and vision transformer (ViT)-combined with fUSI to analyze the pharmacodynamics of Dizocilpine (MK-801), a potent non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used in preclinical models for memory and learning impairments. While all three machine learning techniques could distinguish between drug and control conditions, CNN proved particularly effective due to their ability to capture hierarchical spatial features while maintaining anatomical specificity. Class activation mapping revealed brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, that are significantly affected by drug administration, consistent with the literature reporting a high density of NMDA receptors in these areas. Overall, the combination of fUSI and CNN creates a novel analytical framework for examining pharmacological mechanisms, allowing for data-driven identification and regional mapping of drug effects while preserving anatomical context and physiological relevance.</description>

      <title>Accurate identification of communication between multiple interacting neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.</description>
