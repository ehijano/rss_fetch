      <title>Probability equivalent level for CoVaR and VaR in bivariate Student-\textit{t} copulas with application to foreign exchange risk monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the "probability-equivalent level of VaR and CoVaR" (PELCoV) methodology to accommodate bivariate risks modeled by a Student-t copula, relaxing the strong dependence assumptions of earlier approaches and enhancing the framework's ability to capture tail dependence and asymmetric co-movements. While the theoretical results are developed in a static setting, we implement them dynamically to track evolving risk spillovers over time. We illustrate the practical relevance of our approach through an application to the foreign exchange market, monitoring the USD/GBP exchange rate with the USD/EUR series as an auxiliary early warning indicator over the period 1999-2024. Our results highlight the potential of the extended PELCoV framework to detect early signs of risk underestimation during periods of financial stress.</description>

      <title>Tail-Safe Stochastic-Control SPX-VIX Hedging: A White-Box Bridge Between AI Sensitivities and Arbitrage-Free Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a white-box, risk-sensitive framework for jointly hedging SPX and VIX exposures under transaction costs and regime shifts. The approach couples an arbitrage-free market teacher with a control layer that enforces safety as constraints. On the market side, we integrate an SSVI-based implied-volatility surface and a Cboe-compliant VIX computation (including wing pruning and 30-day interpolation), and connect prices to dynamics via a clipped, convexity-preserving Dupire local-volatility extractor. On the control side, we pose hedging as a small quadratic program with control-barrier-function (CBF) boxes for inventory, rate, and tail risk; a sufficient-descent execution gate that trades only when risk drop justifies cost; and three targeted tail-safety upgrades: a correlation/expiry-aware VIX weight, guarded no-trade bands, and expiry-aware micro-trade thresholds with cooldown. We prove existence/uniqueness and KKT regularity of the per-step QP, forward invariance of safety sets, one-step risk descent when the gate opens, and no chattering with bounded trade rates. For the dynamics layer, we establish positivity and second-order consistency of the discrete Dupire estimator and give an index-coherence bound linking the teacher VIX to a CIR-style proxy with explicit quadrature and projection errors. In a reproducible synthetic environment mirroring exchange rules and execution frictions, the controller reduces expected shortfall while suppressing nuisance turnover, and the teacher-surface construction keeps index-level residuals small and stable.</description>

      <title>A high-frequency approach to Realized Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach, termed Realized Risk Measures (RRM), to estimate Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using high-frequency financial data. It extends the Realized Quantile (RQ) approach proposed by Dimitriadis and Halbleib by lifting the assumption of return self-similarity, which displays some limitations in describing empirical data. More specifically, as the RQ, the RRM method transforms intra-day returns in intrinsic time using a subordinator process, in order to capture the inhomogeneity of trading activity and/or volatility clustering. Then, microstructural effects resulting in non-zero autocorrelation are filtered out using a suitable moving average process. Finally, a fat-tailed distribution is fitted on the cleaned intra-day returns. The return distribution at low frequency (daily) is then extrapolated via either a characteristic function approach or Monte Carlo simulations. VaR and ES are estimated as the quantile and the tail mean of the distribution, respectively. The proposed approach is benchmarked against the RQ through several experiments. Extensive numerical simulations and an empirical study on 18 US stocks show the outperformance of our method, both in terms of the in-sample estimated risk measures and in the out-of-sample risk forecasting</description>

      <title>Cash Flow Underwriting with Bank Transaction Data: Advancing MSME Financial Inclusion in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established or young businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. Firstly, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end to end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Secondly, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Thirdly, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Lastly, we intend to release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSMEs financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.</description>

      <title>Sharp Large Deviations and Gibbs Conditioning for Threshold Models in Portfolio Credit Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.</description>
