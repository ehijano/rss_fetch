      <title>Mamba-Spike: Enhancing the Mamba Architecture with a Spiking Front-End for Efficient Temporal Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of neuromorphic computing has gained significant attention in recent years, aiming to bridge the gap between the efficiency of biological neural networks and the performance of artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Mamba-Spike, a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates a spiking front-end with the Mamba backbone to achieve efficient and robust temporal data processing. The proposed approach leverages the event-driven nature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to capture and process asynchronous, time-varying inputs, while harnessing the power of the Mamba backbone's selective state spaces and linear-time sequence modeling capabilities to model complex temporal dependencies effectively. The spiking front-end of Mamba-Spike employs biologically inspired neuron models, along with adaptive threshold and synaptic dynamics. These components enable efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction and encoding of the input data. The Mamba backbone, on the other hand, utilizes a hierarchical structure with gated recurrent units and attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and selectively process relevant information. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted on both neuromorphic datasets, including DVS Gesture and TIDIGITS, and standard datasets, such as Sequential MNIST and CIFAR10-DVS. The results demonstrate that Mamba-Spike consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved energy efficiency. Moreover, the model exhibits robustness to various input perturbations and noise levels, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

      <title>Adaptive Spiking Neural Networks with Hybrid Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), due to its unique spiking-driven nature, is a more energy-efficient and effective neural network compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The encoding method directly influences the overall performance of the network, and currently, direct encoding is primarily used for directly trained SNNs. When working with static image datasets, direct encoding inputs the same feature map at every time step, failing to fully exploit the spatiotemporal properties of SNNs. While temporal encoding converts input data into spike trains with spatiotemporal characteristics, traditional SNNs utilize the same neurons when processing input data across different time steps, limiting their ability to integrate and utilize spatiotemporal information effectively.To address this, this paper employs temporal encoding and proposes the Adaptive Spiking Neural Network (ASNN), enhancing the utilization of temporal encoding in conventional SNNs. Additionally, temporal encoding is less frequently used because short time steps can lead to significant loss of input data information, often necessitating a higher number of time steps in practical applications. However, training large SNNs with long time steps is challenging due to hardware constraints. To overcome this, this paper introduces a hybrid encoding approach that not only reduces the required time steps for training but also continues to improve the overall network performance.Notably, significant improvements in classification performance are observed on both Spikformer and Spiking ResNet architectures.our code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN</description>

      <title>Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that performs iterative inference over network activities before weight updates. Recent work suggests that PC can converge in fewer learning steps than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning is theoretically not well understood. Here, we study the geometry of the PC energy landscape at the (inference) equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we first show that the equilibrated energy is simply a rescaled mean squared error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Our theory is validated by experiments on both linear and non-linear networks. Based on these results, we conjecture that all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work suggests that PC inference makes the loss landscape more benign and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the challenge of speeding up PC inference on large-scale models.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization in Computation &amp; Chemistry: Return to AlChemy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do complex adaptive systems, such as life, emerge from simple constituent parts? In the 1990s Walter Fontana and Leo Buss proposed a novel modeling approach to this question, based on a formal model of computation known as $\lambda$ calculus. The model demonstrated how simple rules, embedded in a combinatorially large space of possibilities, could yield complex, dynamically stable organizations, reminiscent of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we revisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over the past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the robustness of those results using the greater computing resources available today. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system, demonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility. Specifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently than previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse into trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily combined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the random generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of objects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on the results. Finally, we provide a constructive proof that shows how an extension of the model, based on typed $\lambda$ calculus, \textcolor{black}{could simulate transitions between arbitrary states in any possible chemical reaction network, thus indicating a concrete connection between AlChemy and chemical reaction networks}. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of AlChemy to self-organization in modern programming languages and quantitative approaches to the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis of Single- and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for Chance Constrained Optimization Problems with Normally Distributed Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05799</link>

Abstract: Chance constrained optimization problems allow to model problems where constraints involving stochastic components should only be violated with a small probability. Evolutionary algorithms have been applied to this scenario and shown to achieve high quality results. With this paper, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of evolutionary algorithms for chance constrained optimization. We study the scenario of stochastic components that are independent and normally distributed. Considering the simple single-objective (1+1) EA, we show that imposing an additional uniform constraint already leads to local optima for very restricted scenarios and an exponential optimization time. We therefore introduce a multi-objective formulation of the problem which trades off the expected cost and its variance. We show that multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are highly effective when using this formulation and obtain a set of solutions that contains an optimal solution for any possible confidence level imposed on the constraint. Furthermore, we prove that this approach can also be used to compute a set of optimal solutions for the chance constrained minimum spanning tree problem. In order to deal with potentially exponentially many trade-offs in the multi-objective formulation, we propose and analyze improved convex multi-objective approaches. Experimental investigations on instances of the NP-hard stochastic minimum weight dominating set problem confirm the benefit of the multi-objective and the improved convex multi-objective approach in practice.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization through Meta-Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence but often lack performance when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, a common scenario due to the inevitable domain shifts in real-world applications. This limitation stems from the common assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution--an assumption frequently violated in practice. Despite their effectiveness with large amounts of data and computational power, DNNs struggle with distributional shifts and limited labeled data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization across various tasks and domains. Meta-learning presents a promising approach by employing algorithms that acquire transferable knowledge across various tasks for fast adaptation, eliminating the need to learn each task from scratch. This survey paper delves into the realm of meta-learning with a focus on its contribution to domain generalization. We first clarify the concept of meta-learning for domain generalization and introduce a novel taxonomy based on the feature extraction strategy and the classifier learning methodology, offering a granular view of methodologies. Additionally, we present a decision graph to assist readers in navigating the taxonomy based on data availability and domain shifts, enabling them to select and develop a proper model tailored to their specific problem requirements. Through an exhaustive review of existing methods and underlying theories, we map out the fundamentals of the field. Our survey provides practical insights and an informed discussion on promising research directions.</description>
