      <title>Understanding the approach to thermalization in a non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ of physical states in a SU(2) gauge theory both in and out-of-thermal equilibrium conditions using ab-initio lattice techniques. A non-equilibrium state is realized starting from an over-occupied initial condition for low momentum, soft gluons whereas the thermal state comprises of strongly interacting soft gluons at temperatures where these are well separated from the hard momentum modes. A spectra of positive Lyapunov exponents is observed in both these states, similar to a chaotic dynamical system. From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate the typical time-scale of $\sim 0.50(3)$ fm/c to achieve thermalization at $T\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. We also measure, for the first time, the $\lambda_L$ for long wavelength critical modes of SU(2) using the out-of-time-ordered correlation functions of a classical $Z_2$ scalar field theory, which shares the same universal behavior near the deconfinement phase transition. The $\lambda_L$ is observed to maximize at the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Chiral and isospin breaking in the 2-flavour Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwinger model with two massive fermions is a non-trivial theory for which no analytical solution is known. The strong coupling limit of the theory allows for different semiclassical approximations to extract properties of its low-lying spectrum. In particular, analytical results exist for the fermion condensate, the fermion mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson mass or its decay constant. These approximations, nonetheless, are not able to quantitatively predict isospin breaking effects in the light spectrum, for example. In this paper we use lattice simulations to test various analytical predictions, and study isospin breaking effects from non-degenerate quark masses. We also introduce a low-energy effective field theory based on a non-linear sigma model with a dilaton field, which leads to the correct fermion mass dependence of the pion mass, the correct $\sigma$-to-$\pi$ mass ratio and a prediction of the isospin breaking effects, which we test numerically.</description>

      <title>On the $\theta$-angle physics of QCD under pressure: The strange and isospin phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unveil the impact of the $\theta$-angle on the QCD phase diagram at nonzero isospin and strangeness chemical potentials for three light flavors and different quark mass ratios. We establish the phase boundaries as well as the nature of the associated phase transitions. The order parameters and the physical spectrum in the different phases are determined. We further elucidate the physics around $\theta=\pi$ where we discover a novel parity-preserving superfluid phase. Finally, we comment on Dashen's phenomenon in the superfluid phases when varying the number of light flavors.</description>

      <title>Stochastic normalizing flows for Effective String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) is a powerful tool used to study confinement in pure gauge theories by modeling the confining flux tube connecting a static quark-anti-quark pair as a thin vibrating string. Recently, flow-based samplers have been applied as an efficient numerical method to study EST regularized on the lattice, opening the route to study observables previously inaccessible to standard analytical methods. Flow-based samplers are a class of algorithms based on Normalizing Flows (NFs), deep generative models recently proposed as a promising alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in lattice field theory calculations. By combining NF layers with out-of-equilibrium stochastic updates, we obtain Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs), a scalable class of machine learning algorithms that can be explained in terms of stochastic thermodynamics. In this contribution, we outline EST and SNFs, and report some numerical results for the shape of the flux tube.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 70s. Nearly half a century later, we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to proton and neutron's Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer, to the leading-twist accuracy in collinear factorization. The NLO hard-scattering kernel is computed in the Krankl and Manashov renormalization scheme. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Confronting our state-of-the-art pQCD predictions with the available data for nucleon Dirac form factors, in both space-like and time-like regions, imposes a stringent test on the validity of the parameterized forms of nucleon leading-twist light-cone-distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which have been predicted by a class of QCD sum rules-based models and lattice QCD simulation.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decay of the triply heavy $\Omega_{ccb}$ to the observed $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the weak semileptonic decay of the $ \Omega^{+}_{ccb} \rightarrow \Xi^{++}_{cc} ~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$, where a triply heavy baryon with spin 1/2 decays into the observed doubly heavy baryon with spin 1/2, using QCD sum rule method in all lepton channels. We compute the six relevant vector and axial vector form factors entering the low energy matrix elements in full theory. The invariant form factors are building blocks, using the fit faction of which in terms of $ q^2 $ in whole physical region, we calculate the exclusive widths in three lepton channels. Our predictions may help the present and future experiments in the course of their search for doubly and triply heavy baryons.</description>
