      <title>Deciding subspace reachability problems with application to Skolem's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher-dimensional version of Kannan and Lipton's Orbit Problem asks whether it is decidable if a target vector space can be reached from a starting point under repeated application of a linear transformation. This problem has remained open since its formulation, and in fact generalizes Skolem's Problem -- a long-standing open problem concerning the existence of zeros in linear recurrence sequences. Both problems have traditionally been studied using algebraic and number theoretic machinery. In contrast, this paper reduces the Orbit Problem to an equivalent version in real projective space, introducing a basic geometric reference for examining and deciding problem instances. We find this geometric toolkit enables basic proofs of sweeping assertions concerning the decidability of certain problem classes, including results where the only other known proofs rely on sophisticated number-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Unary counting quantifiers do not increase the expressive power of Presburger aritmetic: an alternative shorter proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work was presented in June 5-7, 2017 at the conference "Journ\'{e}es sur les Arithm\'{e}tiques Faibles -- Weak Arithmetics Days" held in Saint-Pertersburg of which no proceeding was ever published. It was not a new result but showed that a different approach is possible. The paper presented at ICALP 2024 addresses, among other problems, the complexity issues which were ignored in my 2017 talk.</description>

      <title>MARS: A neurosymbolic approach for interpretable drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence describes the combination of logic or rule-based techniques with neural networks. Compared to neural approaches, NeSy methods often possess enhanced interpretability, which is particularly promising for biomedical applications like drug discovery. However, since interpretability is broadly defined, there are no clear guidelines for assessing the biological plausibility of model interpretations. To assess interpretability in the context of drug discovery, we devise a novel prediction task, called drug mechanism-of-action (MoA) deconvolution, with an associated, tailored knowledge graph (KG), MoA-net. We then develop the MoA Retrieval System (MARS), a NeSy approach for drug discovery which leverages logical rules with learned rule weights. Using this interpretable feature alongside domain knowledge, we find that MARS and other NeSy approaches on KGs are susceptible to reasoning shortcuts, in which the prediction of true labels is driven by "degree-bias" rather than the domain-based rules. Subsequently, we demonstrate ways to identify and mitigate this. Thereafter, MARS achieves performance on par with current state-of-the-art models while producing model interpretations aligned with known MoAs.</description>

      <title>LeanAgent: Lifelong Learning for Formal Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in mathematical reasoning tasks such as formal theorem proving when integrated with interactive proof assistants like Lean. Existing approaches involve training or fine-tuning an LLM on a specific dataset to perform well on particular domains, such as undergraduate-level mathematics. These methods struggle with generalizability to advanced mathematics. A fundamental limitation is that these approaches operate on static domains, failing to capture how mathematicians often work across multiple domains and projects simultaneously or cyclically. We present LeanAgent, a novel lifelong learning framework for theorem proving that continuously generalizes to and improves on ever-expanding mathematical knowledge without forgetting previously learned knowledge. LeanAgent introduces several key innovations, including a curriculum learning strategy that optimizes the learning trajectory in terms of mathematical difficulty, a dynamic database for efficient management of evolving mathematical knowledge, and progressive training to balance stability and plasticity. LeanAgent successfully proves 162 theorems previously unproved by humans across 23 diverse Lean repositories, many from advanced mathematics. It performs up to 11$\times$ better than the static LLM baseline, proving challenging theorems in domains like abstract algebra and algebraic topology while showcasing a clear progression of learning from basic concepts to advanced topics. In addition, we analyze LeanAgent's superior performance on key lifelong learning metrics. LeanAgent achieves exceptional scores in stability and backward transfer, where learning new tasks improves performance on previously learned tasks. This emphasizes LeanAgent's continuous generalizability and improvement, explaining its superior theorem proving performance.</description>

      <title>How hard can it be? Quantifying MITRE attack campaigns with attack trees and cATM logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The landscape of cyber threats grows more complex by the day. Advanced Persistent Threats carry out systematic attack campaigns against which cybersecurity practitioners must defend. Examples of such organized attacks are operations Dream Job, Wocao, WannaCry or the SolarWinds Compromise. To evaluate which risks are most threatening, and which campaigns to prioritize against when defending, cybersecurity experts must be equipped with the right toolbox. In particular, they must be able to (a) obtain likelihood values for each attack campaign recorded in the wild and (b) reliably and transparently operationalize these values to carry out quantitative comparisons among campaigns. This will allow security experts to perform quantitatively-informed decision making that is transparent and accountable. In this paper we construct such a framework by: (1) quantifying the likelihood of attack campaigns via data-driven procedures on the MITRE knowledge base and (2) introducing a methodology for automatic modelling of MITRE intelligence data: this is complete in the sense that it captures any attack campaign via template attack tree models. (3) We further propose a computational framework to carry out this comparisons based on the cATM formal logic, and implement this into an open-source Python tool. Finally, we validate our approach by quantifying the likelihood of all MITRE campaigns, and comparing the likelihood of the Wocao and Dream Job MITRE campaigns -- generated with our proposed approach -- against "ad hoc" traditionally-built attack tree models, demonstrating how our methodology is substantially lighter in modelling effort, and still capable of capturing all the quantitative relevant data.</description>

      <title>An Internal Logic of Virtual Double Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a type theory called fibrational virtual double type theory (FVDblTT) designed specifically for formal category theory, which is a succinct reformulation of New and Licata's Virtual Equipment Type Theory (VETT). FVDblTT formalizes reasoning on isomorphisms that are commonly employed in category theory. Virtual double categories are one of the most successful frameworks for developing formal category theory, and FVDblTT has them as a theoretical foundation. We validate its worth as an internal language of virtual double categories by providing a syntax-semantics duality between virtual double categories and specifications in FVDblTT as a biadjunction.</description>

      <title>Further remarks on the dual negation in team logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dual or game-theoretical negation $\lnot$ of independence-friendly logic (IF) and dependence logic (D) exhibits an extreme degree of semantic indeterminacy in that for any pair of sentences $\phi$ and $\psi$ of IF/D, if $\phi$ and $\psi$ are incompatible in the sense that they share no models, there is a sentence $\theta$ of IF/D such that $\phi\equiv \theta$ and $\psi\equiv \lnot \theta$ (as shown originally by Burgess in the equivalent context of the prenex fragment of Henkin quantifier logic). We show that by adjusting the notion of incompatibility employed, analogues of this result can be established for a number of modal and propositional team logics, including Aloni's bilateral state-based modal logic, Hawke and Steinert-Threlkeld's semantic expressivist logic for epistemic modals, as well as propositional dependence logic with the dual negation. Together with its converse, a result of this type can be seen as an expressive completeness theorem with respect to the relevant incompatibility notion; we formulate a notion of expressive completeness for pairs of properties to make this precise.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Process Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer science theory provides many different measures of complexity of a system including Kolmogorov complexity, logical depth, computational depth, and Levin complexity. However, these measures are all defined only for deterministic Turing machines, i.e., deterministic dynamics of the underlying generative process whose output we are interested in. Therefore, by construction they cannot capture complexity of the output of stochastic processes - like those in the real world. Motivated by this observation, we combine probabilistic Turing machines with a prior over the inputs to the Turing machine to define a complete stochastic process of Turing machines. We call this a stochastic process Turing machine. Stochastic process Turing machines allow us to formalize a stochastic generalization of logical depth called stochastic depth, and also to apply stochastic thermodynamics to the analysis of Turing machines. Stochastic process Turing machines and stochastic depth allow us to study the complex, stochastic systems like the human brain, societies, and evolution all from within the framework of formal computation.</description>

      <title>The Transparent Relations Ontology (TRO): a vocabulary to describe conflicts of interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transparent Relations Ontology (TRO) offers a vocabulary to publish data about relations between powerful parties that should be more transparent, in order to detect possible conflicts of interest. TRO is based on minimal modelling, reusing common vocabularies to offer a simple yet useful resource to publish interoperable data about pointers to relations that might result in corruption cases. Additionally, best practices have been followed in order to sustain a technically rigorous ontology development process. A usage example with real data is mentioned, integrating information from Basque Government's Open Data services and a news outlet. Building upon its foundational design, future enhancements of TRO could significantly amplify its utility in uncovering and scrutinizing opaque relationships that may lead to corruption.</description>

      <title>Semantic Tree-Width and Path-Width of Conjunctive Regular Path Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the problem of whether a query is equivalent to a query of tree-width $k$ is decidable, for the class of Unions of Conjunctive Regular Path Queries with two-way navigation (UC2RPQs). A previous result by Barcel\'o, Romero, and Vardi [SIAM Journal on Computing, 2016] has shown decidability for the case $k=1$, and here we extend this result showing that decidability in fact holds for any arbitrary $k\geq 1$. The algorithm is in 2ExpSpace, but for the restricted but practically relevant case where all regular expressions of the query are of the form $a^*$ or $(a_1 + \dotsb + a_n)$ we show that the complexity of the problem drops to $\Pi^P_2$.
  We also investigate the related problem of approximating a UC2RPQ by queries of small tree-width. We exhibit an algorithm which, for any fixed number $k$, builds the maximal under-approximation of tree-width $k$ of a UC2RPQ. The maximal under-approximation of tree-width $k$ of a query $q$ is a query $q'$ of tree-width $k$ which is contained in $q$ in a maximal and unique way, that is, such that for every query $q"$ of tree-width $k$, if $q"$ is contained in $q$ then $q"$ is also contained in $q'$.
  Our approach is shown to be robust, in the sense that it allows also to test equivalence with queries of a given path-width, it also covers the previously known result for $k=1$, and it allows to test for equivalence of whether a (one-way) UCRPQ is equivalent to a UCRPQ of a given tree-width (or path-width).</description>

      <title>About the Expressive Power and Complexity of Order-Invariance with Two Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08410v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order-invariant first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic FO where formulae can make use of a linear order on the structures, under the proviso that they are order-invariant, i.e. that their truth value is the same for all linear orders. We continue the study of the two-variable fragment of order-invariant first-order logic initiated by Zeume and Harwath, and study its complexity and expressive power. We first establish coNExpTime-completeness for the problem of deciding if a given two-variable formula is order-invariant, which tightens and significantly simplifies the coN2ExpTime proof by Zeume and Harwath. Second, we address the question of whether every property expressible in order-invariant two-variable logic is also expressible in first-order logic without the use of a linear order. We suspect that the answer is ``no''. To justify our claim, we present a class of finite tree-like structures (of unbounded degree) in which a relaxed variant of order-invariant two-variable FO expresses properties that are not definable in plain FO. By contrast, we show that if one restricts their attention to classes of structures of bounded degree, then the expressive power of order-invariant two-variable FO is contained within FO.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the expressivity and denotational semantics of a functional higher-order reversible programming language based on Theseus. In this language, pattern-matching is used to ensure the reversibility of functions. We show how one can encode any Reversible Turing Machine in said language. We then build a sound and adequate categorical semantics based on join inverse categories, with additional structures to capture pattern-matching. We then derive a full completeness result, stating that any computable, partial injective function is the image of a term in the language.</description>

      <title>Using Rely/Guarantee to Pinpoint Assumptions underlying Security Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The verification of security protocols is essential, in order to ensure the absence of potential attacks. However, verification results are only valid with respect to the assumptions under which the verification was performed. These assumptions are often hidden and are difficult to identify, making it unclear whether a given protocol is safe to deploy into a particular environment. Rely/guarantee provides a mechanism for abstractly reasoning about the interference from the environment. Using this approach, the assumptions are made clear and precise. This paper investigates this approach on the Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol, showing that the technique can effectively uncover the assumptions under which the protocol can withstand attacks from intruders.</description>

Abstract: We provide a fine classification of bisimilarities between states of possibly different labelled Markov processes (LMP). We show that a bisimilarity relation proposed by Panangaden that uses direct sums coincides with "event bisimilarity" from his joint work with Danos, Desharnais, and Laviolette. We also extend Giorgio Bacci's notions of bisimilarity between two different processes to the case of nondeterministic LMP and generalize the game characterization of state bisimilarity by Clerc et al. for the latter.</description>

      <title>Constant-delay enumeration for SLP-compressed documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of enumerating results from a query over a compressed document. The model we use for compression are straight-line programs (SLPs), which are defined by a context-free grammar that produces a single string. For our queries, we use a model called Annotated Automata, an extension of regular automata that allows annotations on letters. This model extends the notion of Regular Spanners as it allows arbitrarily long outputs. Our main result is an algorithm that evaluates such a query by enumerating all results with output-linear delay after a preprocessing phase which takes linear time on the size of the SLP, and cubic time over the size of the automaton. This is an improvement over Schmid and Schweikardt's result, which, with the same preprocessing time, enumerates with a delay that is logarithmic on the size of the uncompressed document. We achieve this through a persistent data structure named Enumerable Compact Sets with Shifts which guarantees output-linear delay under certain restrictions. These results imply constant-delay enumeration algorithms in the context of regular spanners. Further, we use an extension of annotated automata which utilizes succinctly encoded annotations to save an exponential factor from previous results that dealt with constant-delay enumeration over vset automata. Lastly, we extend our results in the same fashion Schmid and Schweikardt did to allow complex document editing while maintaining the constant delay guarantee.</description>

Abstract: We introduce LogicAsker, a novel approach for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Despite LLMs' prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been challenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream tasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this gap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of LLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs' learning of logical rules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29\% to 90\% across different models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted demonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning in models like GPT-4o by up to 5\%. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to utilize test case outcomes to effectively refine LLMs' formal reasoning capabilities. We make our code, data, and results publicly available (https://github.com/yxwan123/LogicAsker) to facilitate further research and replication of our findings.</description>
