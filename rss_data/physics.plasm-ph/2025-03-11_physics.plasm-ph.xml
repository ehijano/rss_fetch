      <title>Crystal nucleation rates in one-component Yukawa systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleation in the supercooled Yukawa system is relevant for addressing current challenges in understanding a range of crystallizing systems including white dwarf (WD) stars. We use both brute force and seeded molecular dynamics simulations to study homogeneous nucleation of crystals from supercooled Yukawa liquids. With our improved approach to seeded simulations, we obtain quantitative predictions of the crystal nucleation rate and cluster size distributions as a function of temperature and screening length. These quantitative results show trends towards fast nucleation with short-ranged potentials. They also indicate that for temperatures $T &gt; 0.9T_m$, where $T_m$ is the melt temperature, classical homogeneous nucleation is too slow to initiate crystallization but transient clusters of around 100 particles should be common. We apply these general results to a typical WD model and obtain a delay of approximately 0.6 Gyr in the onset of crystallization that may be observable.</description>

      <title>Functional perturbation theory under axisymmetry: Simplified formulae and their uses for tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strictly axisymmetric configurations of tokamaks, field-line tracing reduces from a three-dimensional ODE system to a two-dimensional one, where Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem applies and guarantees the nonexistence of chaos. The formulae of functional perturbation theory (FPT) mostly simplify to compact closed-form expressions to allow the computation to finish instantly, which could improve and accelerate the existing plasma control systems by detangling the plasma dynamics from the magnetic topology change. FPT can conveniently calculate how the key geometric objects of magnetic topology:
  1. the divertor X-point(s) and the magnetic axis,
  2. the last closed flux surface (LCFS)
  3. flux surfaces
  change under perturbation. For example, when the divertor X-point shifts outwards, the LCFS there must expand accordingly, but not necessarily for other places of the LCFS, which could also contract, depending on the perturbation. FPT can not only facilitate adaptive control of plasma, but also enable utilizing as much as possible space in the vacuum vessel by weakening the plasma-wall interaction (PWI) via tuning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{DP}^m$ of the divertor X-point(s), such that the field line connection lengths in the scrape-off layer (SOL) are long enough to achieve detachment. Increasing flux expansion $f_x$ is another option for detachment and can also be facilitated by FPT.
  Apart from the edge, FPT can also benefit the understanding of the plasma core. Since the magnetic axis O-point would also shift under perturbation and the shift is known by FPT, the O-point can be controlled without full knowledge of the plasma response, which shall not significantly change the tendency.</description>

      <title>Testing for Markovian character of transfer of fluctuations in solar wind turbulence on kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply statistical analysis to search for processes responsible for turbulence in physical systems. In our previous studies, we have shown that solar wind turbulence in the inertial range of large magnetohydrodynamic scales exhibits Markov properties. We have recently extended this approach on much smaller kinetic scales. Here we are testing for the Markovian character of stochastic processes in a kinetic regime based on magnetic field and velocity fluctuations in the solar wind, measured onboard the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission: behind the bow shock, inside the magnetosheath, and near the magnetopause. We have verified that the Chapman-Kolmogorov necessary conditions for Markov processes is satisfied for local transfer of energy between the magnetic and velocity fields also on kinetic scales. We have confirmed that for magnetic fluctuations, the first Kramers-Moyal coefficient is linear, while the second term is quadratic, corresponding to drift and diffusion processes in the resulting Fokker-Planck equation. It means that magnetic self-similar turbulence is described by generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We show that for the magnetic case, the Fokker-Planck equation leads to the probability density functions of the kappa distributions, which exhibit global universal scale invariance with a linear scaling and lack of intermittency. On the contrary, for velocity fluctuations, higher order Kramers-Moyal coefficients should be taken into account and hence scale invariance is not observed. However, the nonextensity parameter in Tsallis entropy provides a robust measure of the departure of the system from equilibrium. The obtained results are important for a better understanding of the physical mechanism governing turbulent systems in space and laboratory.</description>

      <title>Time delay of mean field interaction in thermal Rydberg atomic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field theory is commonly employed to study nonequilibrium dynamics in hot Rydberg atomic ensembles, but the fundamental mechanism behind the generation of the mean-field interactions remains poorly understood. In this work, we experimentally observe a time-delay effect in the buildup of mean-field interaction, which reveals the key role of collision ionization. We analyze the relevant collision channels and propose a microscopic mechanism that quantitatively explains the hysteresis window observed in optical bistability. Then, using square-wave modulation spectroscopy (SMS) to monitor the growth of the mean-field interaction, we experimentally demonstrate a delay in its dynamical buildup following the initial Rydberg excitation. Finally, we demonstrate how this delay effect may help understand the recently observed self-sustained oscillations in thermal Rydberg gases. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of ionization processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal Rydberg gas, a system of growing interest for quantum sensing and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive, and validate numerically, an analytical model for electron-only magnetic reconnection applicable to strongly magnetized plasmas. Our model predicts sub-ion-scale reconnection rates significantly higher than those pertaining to large-scale reconnection, aligning with recent observations and simulations. We apply this reconnection model to the problem of inverse magnetic energy transfer at sub-ion scales. We derive time-dependent scaling laws for the magnetic energy decay and the typical magnetic structure dimensions that differ from those previously found in the MHD regime. These scaling laws are validated via two- and three-dimensional simulations, demonstrating that sub-ion scale magnetic fields can reach large, system-size scales via successive coalescence.</description>

      <title>Collimated $ \gamma $-flash emission along the target surface irradiated by a laser at non-grazing incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of a high-power laser with a solid target provides ways to produce beams of $\gamma$-photons. For normal incidence of the laser on the target the beams usually appear in a form of two lobes, which are symmetric with respect to the laser propagation axis. In this work we demonstrate via three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations a regime where for oblique incidence the emission of a collimated $\gamma$-photon beam is in the direction parallel to the target surface. The process is ascribed to the interference pattern in the electromagnetic field formed by the incident and reflected laser pulse. The electromagnetic field accelerates electrons to the GeV energy level, while temporarily directing their momentum along the target surface. Consequently, they emit a collimated $\gamma$-photon beam in the same direction. The dependencies of $\gamma$-photon emission on the incident angle, laser pulse polarization, power and duration and target thickness and preplasma are also addressed in the paper. The beam directionality is important for designing future experiments. In addition, this setup causes the generation of high-order harmonics propagating along the target surface.</description>

      <title>Intermittency assessed through a model of kurtosis-skewness relation in MHD in fast dynamo regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermittency as it occurs in fast dynamos in the MHD framework is evaluated through the examination of relations between normalized moments at third order (skewness S) and fourth order (kurtosis K) for both the velocity and magnetic field, and for their local dissipations. As investigated by several authors in various physical contexts such as fusion plasmas (Krommes (2008)), climate evolution (Sura &amp; Sardeshmukh (2008)), fluid turbulence or rotating stratified flows (Pouquet et al. (2023)), approximate parabolic K(S) ~ alpha laws emerge whose origin may be related to the applicability of intermittency models to their dynamics. The results analyzed herein are obtained through direct numerical simulations of MHD flows for both Taylor-Green and Beltrami ABC forcing at moderate Reynolds numbers, and for up to 314000 turn-over times. We observe for the dissipation 0.2 &lt; alpha &lt;3.0, an evaluation that varies with the field, the forcing, and when filtering for high-skewness intermittent structures. When using the She &amp; Leveque (1994) intermittency model, one can compute alpha analytically; we then find alpha = 2.5, clearly differing from a (strict) parabolic scaling, a result consistent with the numerical data.</description>

      <title>Near-ideal relaxed MHD in slab geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the solutions of the relaxed MHD model (RxMHD) of Dewar \&amp; Qu [J. Plasma Phys. {\bf 88}, 835880101 (2022)]. This model generalizes Taylor relaxation by including the ideal Ohm's law constraint using an augmented Lagrangian method, providing a pathway to extend the multi-region relaxed MHD (MRxMHD) model. We present the first numerical solution of the RxMHD model by Dewar \&amp; Qu, demonstrating that it is mathematically well-defined and computationally feasible for constructing MHD equilibria in slab geometry. We also show that a cross-field flow can exist without enforcing an arbitrary constraint on the angular momentum, as is done in the case of MRxMHD with flow. Our results also demonstrate the self-organization of fully relaxed regions during the optimization, which was an important motivation behind developing this model.</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the ``return stroke''-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed `Main pulse' shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component-type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a unique mode of charge transfer with a range of junction length-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear particle motion and bursty periodic energy deposition in inductively coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that in the regime of low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region near the antenna coil. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are strongly magnetized, with energy deposition being small. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide new analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>
