      <title>Electromagnetic Field Momentum in Theoretical Magnetic Monopole-like Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that some standard models of magnetic charge, the Banderet potential, the Dirac string potential, and the Wu-Yang fiber bundle approach, carry an electromagnetic field momentum in the presence of an electrostatic field. This electromagnetic field momentum suggests a violation of the center-of-energy theorem. We show that each of these monopole models also carry a hidden mechanical momentum, which saves the center-of-energy theorem.</description>

      <title>Schwinger instability, modular flow, and holographic entropy for near-extremal charged BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a charged scalar field in the near-horizon region of a near-extremal charged BTZ black hole. A controlled expansion of the Einstein-Maxwell equations reveals an emergent warped AdS$_2 \times S^1$ throat geometry threaded by a constant electric field--an ideal setting for studying Schwinger pair production, Hawking radiation, and entropy flow. By solving the Klein-Gordon equation using both tunneling and field-theoretic methods, we compute the pair production rate and identify an effective Unruh-like temperature. In particular, we apply the WKB approximation for Hawking tunneling, justified by the infinite blueshift experienced by outgoing modes near the horizon. Instability arises when local acceleration exceeds the AdS curvature scale, linking near-horizon dynamics to thermal emission. Through the generalized uncertainty principle, which implies the existence of a minimal length, we argue that quantum gravity effects can drive the Hawking and Schwinger-like temperatures to zero. To connect quantum radiation to geometry, we analyze the flux of the modular Hamiltonian across the horizon and show that its variation matches the entropic contribution of the produced pairs. Using Tomita-Takesaki theory and the type II\_\infty von Neumann algebra of horizon observables, we derive a semiclassical gravitational constraint involving the second variation of the stress tensor, recovering the null-null component of the Einstein equations from entropy extremization. The intersection point of inward and outward RT geodesics marks both the peak of pair production and the vanishing of entropy variation, revealing a geometric alignment between entanglement, quantum matter, and backreaction. The near-horizon geometry does not merely support quantum effects--it organizes them.</description>

      <title>Surface Gauge Invariance, Soft Limits and the Transmutation of Gluons into Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past year, the "scalar-scaffolding" formalism has revealed a number of new features of gluon amplitudes. In this paper, we leverage these developments to study two distinct but related questions, linked by the scaffolding statement of gauge invariance. We start by revisiting the soft expansion of gluon amplitudes. The scaffolding picture allows for a precise definition of the soft limit and a canonical way to expand the amplitude. At tree-level, this reproduces the classic Weinberg soft theorem, and at one-loop, using surface kinematics, we derive an extension of this theorem valid at the level of the loop integrand. We then switch gears and describe a new relationship between gluon and scalar amplitudes. The expression of surface gauge invariance naturally suggests a certain differential operator acting on individual external gluons. Remarkably, we find that, both for the tree-level amplitude and the surface one-loop integrand, repeated applications of this operator transmutes gluon amplitudes/integrands into those of Tr$(\phi^3)$ scalars. This is an interesting counterpart to the $\delta$-shift connection that lifts "stringy" Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes to those of gluons.</description>

      <title>Mock Modularity Of Twisted Index In CHL Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the twisted partition function of quarter BPS states in CHL models and show that for a large class of single-centered black holes, the degeneracy of microstates is given by the Fourier coefficients of mock Jacobi forms. Our analysis is a continuation of the programme initiated by Dabholkar, Murthy and Zagier (DMZ) for $1/4$-BPS dyons in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ string theory and further extended by Bhand, Sen and Singh (BSS) to quarter BPS states in CHL models. We also present the multiplicative lift construction of the partition function and comment on the additive lift of the same.</description>

      <title>The Manakov-Zakharov-Ward model as an integrable decoupling limit of the membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit can be interpreted as either a non-relativistic or large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating in a toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. We demonstrate that such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background.</description>

      <title>Decoherence by black holes via holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we reexamine decoherence effects in quantum field theories with gravity duals. The thought experiment proposed in \cite{DSW_22, DSW_23}, which reveals novel decoherence patterns associated with black holes, is also manifest in the perspective of the boundary theory. In particular, we consider a moving mirror coupled to quantum critical theories characterized by a dynamical exponent $z$ that are dual to asymptotically Lifshitz geometries. The interference experiment takes place on the boundary, where a superposition of two spatially separated quantum states of a mirror is maintained for a finite time $\tau_0$ before recombination. We find that the interaction with a quantum field at finite temperature, arising from the presence of a Lifshitz black hole, leads to a constant decoherence rate. In contrast, for the zero-temperature case corresponding to pure Lifshitz spacetime, the decoherence rate vanishes in the large-time limit $\tau_0 \to \infty$. Remarkably, in this zero-temperature regime, the decoherence exhibits a power-law decay at large $\tau_0$ as $z \rightarrow \infty$, a behavior reminiscent of the decoherence patterns seen in extremal black hole geometries. In addition, we investigate the decoherence of one particle in an EPR pair constructed holographically. Our results indicate that causality plays a crucial role in determining whether the entanglement leads to the suppression of decoherence in the other particle.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Excitations in Warped and Curved AdS Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies anyonic excitations in warped and curved AdS$_3$ backgrounds via Chern-Simons theory. By incorporating geometric deformations such as conical defects, it is shown that curvature modifies the fusion and braiding properties through corrections to modular data in SU($N$)$_k$ models. Analytical models and numerical simulations reveal how these deformations affect the topological structure and influence holographic duals, especially in relation to entanglement and quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Boundary Effects on Anyon Dynamics in Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the boundary and defect effects on the modular data in SU$(N)_k$ Chern-Simons theories, focusing on how different boundary conditions and symmetry defects modify the fusion rules and braiding statistics of anyons. Using the framework of modular tensor categories (MTCs) and Frobenius algebra objects, explicit expressions for the modified $S$-matrix, $S'$, are derived in the presence of heterogeneous boundary conditions, and the connection between the bulk modular data and edge CFTs is analyzed. The approach includes the computation of modular matrix deformations in the presence of junctions between different boundary conditions, as well as the influence of global symmetry defect lines, which introduce twisted sectors into the MTC framework. The ideas are applied to SU$(2)_k$, SU$(3)_2$, and SU$(4)_1$ Chern-Simons theories, providing examples of boundary algebras and fusion rules at junctions. Additionally, the implications of categorical anomaly inflow and central charge matching across boundary and defect sectors are explored. This work lays the groundwork for further studies of boundary and defect effects in topological quantum field theories and their connections to topological quantum computation and holography.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Nature of Cosmological Effective Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of our intuition about Effective Field Theories (EFTs) stems from their formulation in flat spacetime, yet EFTs have become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent backgrounds are the norm. In this work, we demonstrate that in spacetimes undergoing significant expansion-such as accelerated FLRW and de Sitter backgrounds-the contributions of operators with mass dimension $\Delta$ to physical observables grow factorially with $\Delta$ at fixed couplings. This behavior stands in stark contrast to expectations from flat spacetime. As a result, the cosmological EFT expansion is generally asymptotic rather than convergent, even at tree level.
  To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze simple toy models involving a massless or conformally coupled scalar field interacting with a heavy scalar with zero or infinite sound speed. We demonstrate that meaningful EFT predictions can still be extracted via appropriate resummation techniques, performed in both Fourier and Mellin-momentum space. In the infinite sound speed limit, where the heavy field is effectively non-dynamical, the resummed EFT reproduces the exact result of the full theory. In other cases, the EFT captures only the local part of the dynamics, omitting nonlocal terms, which are exponentially suppressed in the large-mass limit for the Bunch-Davies state.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Graviweak Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graviweak theory seeks to unify gravity (specifically in its self-dual formulation) with the weak interaction, preying on their parallel chiral $SU(2)$ structures. In this paper we further this idea by folding it with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We do this first with a standard Higgs field and potential, starting with a unifying parity-invariant theory which splits into the usual gravity and weak sector under spontaneous symmetry breaking. By rewriting the theory in the two-spin framework we are then prompted to discuss generalizations, within the generic approach known as MacDowell-Mansouri theories where a larger internal gauge group is broken. One of the predictions of the ensuing construction is a non-minimal coupling in the low energy broken phase between curvature and the weak gauge fields, translating at the quantum level to a direct channel between the graviton and the weak bosons.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM), which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify a key point in the geometric reinterpretation of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar (GW) model proposed in "Geometry of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model" [JHEP 03 (2010) 053]. Specifically, we show that the analysis in Section 6 was applied not to the actual $\Omega$-term in the GW action, but to a closely related term involving a mixed use of ordinary and star-products. Once corrected, the main conclusion -- relating the harmonic potential term to background curvature -- remains valid, though the parameter identification must be revised. This also resolves a discrepancy concerning the emergence of certain vacuum solutions in the self-dual limit of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories can be solved exactly slightly away from the supersymmetric (SUSY) limit softly broken by anomaly mediation when the size of SUSY breaking is much smaller than the dynamical scale ($m \ll \Lambda$). We show empirical evidence that the near-SUSY limit is continuously connected to the non-SUSY limit ($m \gg \Lambda$) in $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ quarks in the fundamental representation. The evidence includes the behavior of quark bi-linear condensate and gluon condensates, light hadron spectra, and consistency with the large $N_c$ limit. In addition, we present new predictions when $N_f/N_c \gtrsim O(1)$.</description>

      <title>On the global Gaussian bending measure and its applications in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02195v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories have been suggested to address the limitations of general relativity, each exhibiting differences, particularly in their strong-field limits. Nonetheless, there lacks effective means to distinguish or test these theories through local strong-field measurements. In this work, we define a global Gaussian bending measure over singular spacetime regions, establish a corresponding global theory, and demonstrate its applications in a general stationary spacetime. The global theory is based on differential geometry, rather than on specific gravity theories, allowing it to depict various physics within general relativity and beyond. For example, it can be applied to describe the gravitational bending of massless or massive messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and possibly massive gravitational waves predicted in certain theories of gravity. Besides, the global theory is applicable to any stationary spacetime regions outside a rotating black hole. As an instance of its direct applications, we investigate the highly-curved spacetime effects of the black hole in its immediate surrounding regions and design local strong-field experiments involving different shapes of singular lensing patches. New means can be therefore anticipated to be developed according to the global theory to differentiate between different gravity theories and test them in their strong-field regions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Energy Correlator at Hadron Colliders: Celestial Blocks and Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an event shape observable that characterizes the distribution of energy flux in collision events. We initiate the study of full-range EEC at hadron colliders, generalizing the extensively studied EEC in $e^+e^-$ collision as well as the transverse EEC in hadron collisions. We derive celestial blocks from Lorentz symmetry to perform partial wave decomposition of the EEC at hadron colliders. These celestial blocks are essentially conformal blocks on the 2d celestial sphere, which have additional dependence on the collinear spin of ``light-ray transition matrix'' along the collision axis. In this work, we perform the first leading-order (LO) analytic calculation of this observable in pure Yang-Mills theory and use it as an example to illustrate the block decomposition. Numerically, the block expansion demonstrates superior accuracy in the collinear limit compared to conventional power series expansion. Analytically, we observe in this example that the block coefficients exhibit analyticity in both collinear and transverse spin. In addition, we analyze several kinematic limits at LO -- collinear, back-to-back, opposite coplanar and Regge limit. While the first three limits naturally generalize their $e^+e^-$ collision counterparts or transverse EEC and are governed by soft-collinear dynamics, the Regge limit requires complete angular dependence and reveals BFKL physics. Phenomenologically, we propose a realistic experimental setup and briefly discuss how the convolution of parton distribution function modifies the perturbative EEC result. Our work suggests that the full-range EEC at hadron colliders is an elegant observable which probes a broader kinematic space and connects various regimes of different QCD dynamics through a single measurement.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar field perturbations of 4D de Sitter Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of massive scalar fields in the background of four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes with de Sitter (dS) asymptotics. Our study focuses on the various branches of quasinormal modes present in this background, employing the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We identify that the introduction of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ gives rise to three branches of modes: the perturbative (in $\alpha$) Schwarzschild branch, the perturbative (in $\alpha$) dS branch, and a non-perturbative (in $\alpha$) dS branch. Our results show that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background. Furthermore, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant induces significant deviations in the Schwarzschild branch and smaller deviations in the perturbative dS branch compared to the corresponding branches in the Schwarzschild-dS limit. Additionally, the non-perturbative dS branch of modes, absent when $\alpha=0$, emerges as a novel feature of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet framework.</description>

      <title>A pedagogical approach to the black hole information problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semiclassical depiction of gravity has provided many important results, such as particle creation effects in expanding universes and in spacetimes containing black holes. However, many questions remain open, most notably concerning the final product of the black hole evaporation process and the conservation of information. From a pedagogical perspective, we review the concepts that lead to this state of affairs, also known as the black hole information problem, and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. Stating the necessary conjectures and results that lead to the geometrical properties of black holes, we present the notion of black hole evaporation and the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory under the Hadamard condition. We then show that the formation and complete evaporation of a black hole leads to information loss. Comparing such a result to the main alternatives to this non-unitary dynamical evolution, we formulate the black hole information problem and show that information loss is a genuine prediction if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>

      <title>On the bound states of the Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical significance and spectral stability of black hole quasinormal modes is fundamental to high-precision spectroscopy with future gravitational wave detectors. Inspired by Mashhoon's idea of relating quasinormal modes of black holes with their equivalent bound states in an inverted potential, we investigate, for the first time, energy levels and eigenfunctions of the Schwarzschild black hole quantitatively. While quasinormal modes describe the characteristic damped oscillations of a black hole, the bound states of the inverted potential are qualitatively more similar to those of the hydrogen atom. Although the physical interpretation of these states may initially be of more academic interest, it furthers our understanding of open problems related to quasinormal modes in a similar spirit to Maggiore's interpretation of the Schwarzschild quasinormal mode spectrum. One surprising insight from the explicit calculation of bound states is that eigenfunctions corresponding to quasinormal mode overtones become rapidly delocalized and extremely loosely bound. This observation raises immediate questions about the common interpretation of quasinormal modes as excitations of the lightring region. Closely related, as a second application, we also explore the spectral stability of bound states and demonstrate that they can provide complementary insights into the quasinormal mode spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present the black hole information problem and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. As the problem arises in the framework of semiclassical gravity, we first review the necessary notions to describe Lorentzian manifolds equipped with physical properties, as well as the physical concepts of the theory that describes the gravitational interaction as the curvature of spacetime, general relativity. From its classical perspective, we develop the formalism to study the dynamical aspects of black holes in spacetimes obeying suitable causality conditions. Equipped with conjectures that nature censors naked singularities and that black holes reach a stationary configuration after they form, the black hole uniqueness theorems allow us to review several relations for the geometrical quantities associated with them. Following considerations of the other fundamental interactions, which are described by quantum field theory, we review the arguments in the formalism of quantum field theory in curved spacetime that give rise to the effective particle creation effect, its approximately thermal character, and the concept of black hole evaporation. With a precise quantification of information in quantum mechanics and assuming that the condition for physically acceptable states is given by the Hadamard condition, we review the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory. As a consequence, we discuss how the formation and complete evaporation of black holes leads to information loss. Conscious that such a prediction follows if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale, we discuss alternatives to this nonunitary dynamical evolution and formulate the black hole information problem. Lastly, we analyze the assumptions and hypotheses that lead to the problem.</description>

      <title>Does Unruh effect necessarily imply entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that despite the fact that an accelerating observer would note the Minkowski vacuum to be thermal, which is the well known Unruh's effect, an inconsistency is implied writing the Minkowski vacuum as an entangled state between Rindler wedges. We first use the textbook derivation showing the Minkowski vacuum as an entangled state between Rindler wedges as an inspiration to construct alternate spacetimes, where the Minkowski vacuum can be written as a thermofield double state between disconnected regions of spacetime, and show that no thermality is implied by calculations using Bogoluibov coefficients. We next highlight issues in this textbook derivation by first noting the blowing up of Bogoluibov coefficients at $k=0$, followed by showing that that two point correlation function evaluations are inconsistent, despite the thermal nature of the particle spectrum as witnessed by observers following boost orbits. We highlight the reason behind the inconsistency in the derivation as an issue with expanding the relevant fields in a complete set of frequency modes.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes through preheating instabilities in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the context of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, focusing on the preheating phase following inflation. During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. PBH formation is analyzed using three criteria: (1) the perturbation must lie within the instability band, (2) its characteristic length must exceed the Jeans length, and (3) it must have sufficient time to collapse based on the estimations of massive scalar field spherical collapse in Einstein-de Sitter universe. Based on these criteria, we calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating, as it neglects nonspherical effects. In contrast, the KP formalism yields more realistic predictions by incorporating such effects. We provide a detailed comparison with observational constraints from evaporating PBHs. Notably, the PS formalism is excluded by these constraints, which are based on Hawking radiation, while the KP formalism remains viable. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonspherical effects and accurate collapse dynamics in studies of PBH formation during preheating.</description>

Abstract: We present a general formula for the amplitude of forward exclusive hadronic processes in the semihard regime of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), by means of the {\em next-to-leading order} eigenfunctions of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) kernel, as constructed by Chirilli and Kovchegov. We discuss some formal subtleties in the check of compatibility with the similar formula based on the use of the {\em leading-order} BFKL eigenfunctions. Finally, in the specific case of the electroproduction of two light vector mesons, we consider the numerical stability of the amplitude when one or the other set of eigenfunctions is adopted.</description>

      <title>The Noether formalism for constructing conserved quantities in teleparallel equivalents of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper brings a methodological character where we present a comprehensive formalism for constructing conserved quantities in the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR). It was developed in series of our earlier works and, here, we unite it into a complete form. By employing the Noether method within a tensor formalism, conserved currents, superpotentials, and charges are constructed. These are shown to be covariant under coordinate transformations and local Lorentz rotations in TEGR, while in STEGR, they are covariant under coordinate transformations. The teleparallel (flat) connections in both theories are defined using the "turning off gravity" principle. Uniting such defined flat connections with tetrad in TEGR and metric in STEGR a new fruitful in applications notion "gauge" is introduced. The choice of various initial tetrads in TEGR or initial coordinates in STEGR leads to different gauges, what gives different conserved quantities. Finally, we discuss an appropriate choice of gauges from a possible set of them.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the recently published analytic results for unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. These expressions for the hard scattering coefficients contain case distinctions in the kinematic $(x,z)$ plane splitting the analytic result in four regions. By re-expressing the coefficient functions in terms of single-valued polylogarithms we remove these case distinctions and can present a unified result valid in the entire kinematic range of SIDIS. This reduces the length of the overall expressions by 30% to 60%.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order topological phases with invertible symmetries have been extensively studied in recent years, revealing gapless modes localized on boundaries of higher codimension. In this work, we extend the framework of higher-order symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases to include non-invertible symmetries. We construct a concrete model of a second-order SPT phase in $2+1$ dimensions that hosts symmetry-protected corner modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry. This construction is then generalized to a $d^{th}$-order SPT phase in $d+1$ dimensions, featuring similarly protected corner modes. Additionally, we demonstrate a second-order SPT phase in $3+1$ dimensions exhibiting hinge modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing the gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including discovering multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) under strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models, of thawing type, and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytic expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$ in terms of matter evolution; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Using finally the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytic bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

Abstract: Emitted radiation and absorption effects in black hole dynamics lead to inelastic scattering amplitudes. In this paper, we study how these effects introduce an inelasticity function to the $2\rightarrow2$ eikonalised $S$-matrix and how they can be described using unequal mass and spin on-shell amplitudes. To achieve this, we formulate the inelastic coupled-channel eikonal (ICCE) using the KMOC formalism and the language of quantum channels, where off-diagonal channels involve mass and spin changes. This formulation allows us to re-use usual eikonal results but also suggests a different resummation of inelastic effects. We then apply this formulation to calculate classical inelastic processes, such as the mass change in binary dynamics due to the presence of an event horizon. Additionally, we provide a complementary analysis for the case of wave scattering on a black hole, considering absorption effects. In both scenarios, we derive unitarity relations accounting for inelastic effects.</description>

Abstract: In this work we establish every spherically symmetric non-Abelian Z(2) monopole generated by su(2) embeddings in the SU(4) Yang-Mills-Higgs model minimally broken to SO(4) by a symmetric second-rank tensor Higgs field. We find new monopole solutions associated with index 4 and index 10 embeddings. These solutions belong to su(2) multiplets that are higher dimensional than triplets. Properties of these monopoles such as their mass and radius are calculated in the vanishing potential limit. A parallel between this result and the Standard Model hierarchy of fermion masses is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I construct supersymmetric AdS$_3$ vacua of type IIB string theory that exhibit parametric scale separation in the controlled regime. These solutions arise from compactifications on seven-dimensional manifolds equipped with co-closed $G_2$-structures, in the presence of orientifold planes preserving minimal supersymmetry. I focus on $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ orbifolds of a specific solvmanifold and all seven-dimensional nilmanifolds, each requiring distinct configurations of intersecting O5-planes, which are treated in the smeared approximation. Weak string coupling, large volumes and scale separation for the classical backgrounds on the nilmanifolds are achieved by tuning unbounded fluxes to large values. Furthermore, for some solutions, the holographic field theory operators dual to the lightest scalar fields have integer conformal dimensions at tree level, as in other scale-separated type II orientifold backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

Abstract: Non-geometric flux vacua have recently been revisited, leading to the remarkable discovery of isolated 4D ${\mathcal N}=1$ supersymmetric Minkowski vacua. These constructions rely on the non-renormalization of the superpotential, which is supported by heuristic arguments. Given the significance of verifying the existence of these isolated M-theory-like vacua, we present alternative symmetry-based arguments that arrive at the same conclusion. Additionally, we leverage these symmetries to argue for the existence of unstable dS solutions as well as supersymmetric AdS solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.</description>

      <title>Conformal boundaries near extremal black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine four dimensional, near-extremal black hole solutions in the presence of a finite boundary obeying conformal boundary conditions, where the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Working in Euclidean signature and at fixed charge, we find the near-extremal regime is dominated by a double-scaling limit which reveals new scaling laws for the quasi-local conformal entropy at low temperatures. Upon spherical dimensional reduction, we obtain the effective two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theory that describes the near-extremal regime. In contrast to Dirichlet boundaries, for conformal boundaries a linear dilaton potential is not sufficient to capture the leading correction away from extremality and higher orders are needed. We also examine near-Nariai solutions and the spherical reduction of pure three-dimensional gravity in (Anti-) de Sitter space. In the latter, provided the boundary is placed near the conformal boundary of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, the dynamics of the spherically symmetric boundary mode is governed by a Liouville equation that descends from a (minus) Schwarzian effective action.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ Bulk Hilbert Space in ETH Matrix Model for double-scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of chord number in the strict large $N$ double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model to the corresponding finite $N$ ETH matrix model. The chord number in the strict large $N$ DSSYK model is known to correspond to the discrete length of the Einstein-Rosen bridge in the gravity dual, which reduces to the renormalized geodesic length in JT gravity at weak coupling. At finite $N$, these chord number states form an over-complete basis of the non-perturbative Hilbert space, as the structure of the inner product gets significantly modified due to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem: There are infinitely many null states. In this paper, by considering ``EFT for gravitational observables'' or a version of ``non-isometric code'', we construct a family of chord number operators at finite $N$. While the constructed chord number operator depends on the reference chord number state, it realizes approximate $q$-deformed oscillator algebra and reproduces semiclassical bulk geometry around the reference state. As a special case, we will show that when the reference is chosen to be the chord number zero state, the chord number operator precisely matches with the Krylov state complexity, leading to the ``ramp-slope-plateau'' behavior at late times, implying the formation of ``gray hole''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the effect of scattering gravitational radiation off the static background curvature, up to second order in Newton constant, known in literature as tail and tail-of-tail processes, for generic electric and magnetic multipoles. Starting from the multipole expansion of composite compact objects, and as expected due to the known electric quadrupole case, both long- and short-distance (UV) divergences are encountered. The former disappears from properly defined observables, the latter are renormalized and their associated logarithms give rise to a classical renormalization group flow. UV divergences alert for incompleteness of the multipolar description of the composite source, and are expected not to be present in a UV-complete theory, as explicitly derived in literature for the case of conservative dynamics. Logarithmic terms from tail-of-tail processes associated to generic magnetic multipoles are computed in this work for the first time.</description>

      <title>New Uncertainty Principle for a particle on a Torus Knot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work deals with quantum Uncertainty Relations (UR) subjected to the Standard Deviations (SD) of the relevant dynamical variables for a particle constrained to move on a torus knot. It is important to note that these variables have to obey the two distinct periodicities of the knotted paths embedded on the torus. We compute generalized forms of the SDs and the subsequent URs (following the Kennard-Robertson formalism). These quantities explicitly involve the torus parameters and the knot parameters where restrictions on the latter have to be taken into account. These induce restrictions on the possible form of wave functions that are used to calculate the SDs and URs and in our simple example, two distinct SDs and URs are possible. In a certain limit (thin torus limit), our results will reduce to the results for a particle moving in a circle.
  An interesting fact emerges that in the case of the SDs and URs, the local geometry of the knots plays the decisive role and not their topological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geodesics of Kerr's metric are described by the four-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics integrable in the Arnold--Liouville sense. It can be reduced to two-dimensional one by the use of Fermat's principle. The resulting Hamiltonian is, however, rather complicated. We show how one can apply the coupling constant metamorphosis to simplify the Hamiltonian to the one quadratic in momenta and depending on the initial "energy" as parameter. It describes a simple dynamics of two non-linear oscillators and can be integrated directly or evaluated in the framework of perturbation theory by adopting the elegant Lindstedt--Poincar\'e algorithm. The idea of coupling constant metamorphosis is also applied to the Myers--Perry metric -- a five dimensional generalization of Kerr's metric. The case of single rotation parameter is considered in some detail.</description>

Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate it in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chern-Simons gravitational term is typically coupled to the inflaton field during inflation. However, this setup leads to ghost instabilities in the tensor sector, which severely constrain observable signatures of parity violation in cosmological correlators. In this work, we explore an alternative scenario where the Chern-Simons term is minimally coupled to an isocurvature field, $\sigma$, within a multi-field inflationary framework. Notably, this configuration leaves the quadratic action for tensor perturbations unaffected, thereby avoiding ghost instabilities. We analyze the resulting phenomenology and show that the model allows for parity-violating signatures and distinctive features in the primordial scalar-tensor bispectra, while remaining theoretically consistent and observationally viable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What happens when fermions hop on a lattice with crystalline defects? The answer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand the topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms of crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we study in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D Dirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline topological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the fermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of crystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant flux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and anti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents and energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a rich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles scatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point out a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry class AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with $(C_M)^M = +1$.</description>

      <title>Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>

Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi |^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several common features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Quantum Stress-Energy Tensor of a Nonzero Radius Cosmic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of quantum fluctuations of a scalar field in the "ballpoint pen" cosmic string geometry. Using the approach to renormalization established previously for the energy density in two space dimensions, we extend those calculations to $3+1$ dimensions, nonzero scalar mass, and the full stress-energy tensor, including its contribution to the null energy condition for radial geodesics. The calculation demonstrates in detail the process of renormalization in curved spacetime, including the effects of the conformal anomaly. This model provides one of the few examples where quantum effects in curved spacetime can be explicitly calculated.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT-}$Symmetric Open Quantum Systems: Information Theoretic Facets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of an $\eta$-pseudo Hermitian Hamiltonian with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is reviewed and extended to include open system dynamics. Inspired by a simple light matter interaction open system model, information theoretic quantities like a non-Markovian witness and fidelity are calculated for the $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric Hamiltonian, and the results are compared with their corresponding Hermitian counterparts. The nature of entanglement between two $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric and Hermitian open quantum systems is calculated, and the contrast observed.</description>
