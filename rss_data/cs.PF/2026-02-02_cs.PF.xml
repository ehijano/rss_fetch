      <title>AscendCraft: Automatic Ascend NPU Kernel Generation via DSL-Guided Transcompilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning models critically depends on efficient kernel implementations, yet developing high-performance kernels for specialized accelerators remains time-consuming and expertise-intensive. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate correct and performant GPU kernels, kernel generation for neural processing units (NPUs) remains largely underexplored due to domain-specific programming models, limited public examples, and sparse documentation. Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.
  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels. Beyond benchmarks, AscendCraft further demonstrates its generality by successfully generating two correct kernels for newly proposed mHC architecture, achieving performance that substantially surpasses PyTorch eager execution.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Real-World Impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography on WPA-Enterprise Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large-scale quantum computers poses a significant threat to contemporary network security protocols, including Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)-Enterprise authentication. To mitigate this threat, the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is critical. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of PQC algorithms on WPA-Enterprise-based authentication. To this end, we conduct an experimental evaluation of authentication latency using a testbed built with the open-source tools FreeRADIUS and hostapd, measuring the time spent at the client, access point, and RADIUS server. We evaluate multiple combinations of PQC algorithms and analyze their performance overhead in comparison to currently deployed cryptographic schemes. Beyond performance, we assess the security implications of these algorithm choices by relating authentication mechanisms to the quantum effort required for their exploitation. This perspective enables a systematic categorization of PQ-relevant weaknesses in WPA-Enterprise according to their practical urgency. The evaluation results show that, although PQC introduces additional authentication latency, combinations such as ML-DSA-65 and Falcon-1024 used in conjunction with ML-KEM provide a favorable trade-off between security and performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the resulting overhead can be effectively mitigated through session resumption. Overall, this work presents a first real-world performance evaluation of PQC-enabled WPA-Enterprise authentication and demonstrates its practical feasibility for enterprise Wi-Fi deployments.</description>

      <title>SuperCoder: Assembly Program Superoptimization with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superoptimization is the task of transforming a program into a faster one while preserving its input-output behavior. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup, with additional improvement enabled by Best-of-N sampling and iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</description>

      <title>Obfuscation as an Effective Signal for Prioritizing Cross-Chain Smart Contract Audits: Large-Scale Measurement and Risk Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obfuscation raises the interpretation cost of smart-contract auditing, yet its signals are hard to transfer across chains. We present HOBFNET, a fast surrogate of OBFPROBE, enabling million-scale cross-chain scoring. The model aligns with tool outputs on Ethereum (PCC 0.9158, MAPE 8.20 percent) and achieves 8-9 ms per contract, yielding a 2.3k-5.2k times speedup. Across BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche, we observe systematic score drift, motivating within-chain percentile queues (p99 as the main queue, p99.9 as an emergency queue). The high-score tail is characterized by rare selectors, external-call enrichment, and low signature density, supporting secondary triage. Cross-chain reuse is tail-enriched and directionally biased from smaller to larger ecosystems. On two publicly alignable cross-chain spillover cases, both fall into the p99 queue, indicating real-world hit value. We deliver a two-tier audit queue and a cross-chain linkage workflow for practical security operations.</description>
