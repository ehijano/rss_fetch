      <title>Constraints to the inert doublet model of dark matter with very high-energy gamma-rays observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics featuring a scalar dark matter candidate, using data from recent and future gamma-ray observatories. The relevance of the model for indirect searches of dark matter stems from two key features: first, in the high-mass regime, IDM can achieve the correct dark matter relic abundance for masses between approximately 500 GeV and 25 TeV, aligning perfectly with the energy sensitivity of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Second, this regime is dominated by co-annihilation processes, which elevate the thermal-relic velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section to the range of 0.5 $-$ 1.0$\times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, thereby enhancing the potential gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation. Analyzing recent H.E.S.S. observations of the Galactic Center region, we find that dark matter particle masses within the 1 to 8 TeV range are excluded by current data. Furthermore, we project that the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will comprehensively probe the remaining viable parameter space of the IDM. Our findings are further examined in the context of the most recent theoretical constraints, collider searches, and direct detection results from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment.</description>

      <title>Dark Particles at the LHC: LHC-Friendly Dark Matter Characterization via Non-Linear EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we illustrate a general framework to describe the LHC phenomenology of extended scalar (and fermion) sectors, with focus on dark matter (DM) physics, based on an effective field theory (EFT) with non-linearly realized electroweak symmetry. Generalizing Higgs EFT (HEFT), the setup allows to include a generic set of new scalar resonances, without the need to specify their UV origin, that could for example be at the interface of the Standard Model (SM) and the DM world. In particular, we study the case of fermionic DM interacting with the SM via two mediators, each of which can possess either CP property and originate from various electroweak representations in the UV theory. Besides trilinear interactions between the mediators and DM or SM pairs (including pairs of gauge field-strength tensors), the EFT contains all further gauge-invariant operators up to mass dimension $D=5$. While remaining theoretically consistent, this setup offers enough flexibility to capture the phenomenology of many benchmark models used to interpret the results of experimental DM and BSM searches, such as two-Higgs doublet extensions of the SM or singlet extensions. Furthermore, the presence of two mediators with potentially sizable couplings allows to account for a broad variety of interesting collider signatures, as for example detectable mono-$h$ and mono-$Z$ signals. Correlations can be employed to diagnose the nature of the new particles.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

      <title>$B\to X_c\ell\bar{\nu}$ Decay as a Probe of Complex Conjugate Poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, nontrivial analytic structure of the quark propagator is discussed for $B$-meson inclusive decays. Attributed to invalidity of the standard K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehman spectral representation, complex conjugate poles alter the evaluation of decay rates, which lead to violation of quark-hadron duality. As phenomenological observables, widths in $B\to X_c\ell\bar{\nu}$ decay as well as lifetime of $B_d^0$ meson are discussed. In the presence of the mentioned nonanalytical contributions, the possibility for resolving the $|V_{cb}|$ puzzle is addressed. It is demonstrated that there exists a parameter region which explains $|V_{cb}|$ and $B_d^0$-meson lifetime simultaneously within 1$\sigma$ via the complex conjugate poles from charm quark.</description>

      <title>Exploring electromagnetic characteristics of the vector and axial-vector $B_c$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic moments of the $B_c$ mesons provide significant insights into their inner structure and geometric shape. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the electromagnetic characteristics of $B_c$ mesons is essential for advancing our knowledge of confinement and heavy flavor effects. In light of this, we proceed to extract the magnetic moments of the ground-state vector and axial-vector $B_c$ mesons through the medium of the QCD light-cone sum rules. The magnetic moments of the axial-vector and vector $B_c$ mesons are found to be $\mu_{B_c}= -0.47 \pm 0.07~\mu_N$, and $\mu_{B_c}= 0.15 \pm 0.02~\mu_N$, respectively. A comparison of our results for the vector $B_c$ meson with other theoretical predictions has revealed discrepancies between the various predictions, which could prove useful as a complementary tool for interpreting the vector $B_c$ meson. The current experimental data set is limited to a small number of observed states of beauty-charm mesons. However, theoretical studies can play a valuable role in elucidating their nature and guiding future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Boost-invariant spin hydrodynamics with spin feedback effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently formulated extension of perfect spin hydrodynamics, which includes second-order corrections in the spin polarization tensor to the energy-momentum tensor and baryon current, is studied in the case of a one-dimensional boost-invariant expansion. The presence of second-order corrections introduces feedback from spin dynamics on the hydrodynamic background, constraining possible spin polarization configurations. However, as long as the magnitude of the spin polarization tensor remains small (below unity in natural units), the permitted spin dynamics differs very little from that found in the case without the second-order corrections.</description>

      <title>Pair creation, backreaction, and resummation in strong fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit particle creation in strong fields, and backreaction on those fields, from an amplitudes perspective. We describe the strong field by an initial coherent state of photons which we explicitly evolve in time, thus going beyond the background field approximation, and then consider observables which quantify the effects of backreaction. We present expressions for the waveform, vacuum persistence probability, and number of produced photons at next-to-leading order, all of which are impacted by backreaction, along with the number and statistics of produced pairs. We find that converting between in-out (amplitude) and in-in (expectation value) expressions requires explicit resummation of an infinite number of disconnected loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Spin Transfer to $\Lambda$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $\Lambda$ production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering using a polarized lepton beam and find that the spin transfer is significantly suppressed by target fragmentation. As further demonstrated by a model estimation, experimental data can be well described once the target fragmentation is taken into account, which alleviates the tension with calculations solely based on current fragmentation. Our findings suggest that, at the energies of existing fixed-target experiments, the separation of current and fragmentation regions is not distinct. Spin transfer as well as other spin effects offers a sensitive probe into the origin of the produced hadron.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-observables and Deep Neural Network for mixed CP -- H to tau tau decays at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consecutive steps of H to tau tau cascade can be useful for the measurement of Higgs couplings and parity. The analysis methos of ATLAS and CMS Collaborations was to fit a one-dimensional distribution of the phi* angle, phi*, which is sensitive to transverse spin correlations and, hence, to the CP mixing angle, phi^CP. Machine Learning techniques (ML) offer opportunities to manage complex multidimensional signatures. The 4-momenta of the tau decay products can be used as input to the machine learning and to predict the CP-sensitive pseudo-observables and/or provide discrimination between different CP hypotheses. We show that the classification or regression methods can be used to train an ML model to predict the spin weight sensitive to the CP state of the decaying Higgs boson, parameters of the functional form of the spin weight, or the most preferred CP mixing angle of the analysed sample. The one-dimensional distribution of the predicted spin weight or the most preferred CP mixing angle of the experimental data can be examined further, with the statistical methods, to derive the measurement of the CP mixing state of the Higgs signal events. This paper extends our previous studies, with more details for the features and how proposed pseudo-observables can be used in the measurement.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on pseudo-gauge transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical pseudo-gauge transformations are discussed in the context of hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions. A decomposition of the pseudo-gauge transformation into Lorentz-invariant tensors is made, which allows for better interpretation of its physical consequences. For pseudo-gauge transformations connecting two symmetric energy-momentum tensors, we find that the super-potential $\Phi^{\lambda, \mu \nu}$ must obey a conservation law of the form $\partial_\lambda \Phi^{\lambda, \mu \nu} = 0$. This equation, referred to below as the STS condition, represents a constraint that is hardly possible to be satisfied for tensors constructed out of the basic hydrodynamic variables such as temperature, baryon chemical potential, and the hydrodynamic flow. However, in a special case of the boost-invariant flow, the STS condition is automatically fulfilled and a non-trivial residual pseudo-gauge transformation defined by a single scalar field is allowed. In this case the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients become pseudo-gauge dependent; however, their specific linear combination appearing in the equations of motion remains pseudo-gauge invariant. This finding provides new insights into the role of pseudo-gauge transformations and pseudo-gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for quark flavor invariants and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work delves into the study of flavor invariants and, in special, invariants capable of detecting CP (Charge-Parity) violation. Through the mathematical tool of the Hilbert series, we systematically enumerate and explore flavor invariants that are unchanged under weak basis transformations. After reviewing the Hilbert series and the flavor invariants of the SM quark sector, we apply the tool of Hilbert series to the SM extended by a singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) of down-type. The introduction of these hypothetical particles leads to a simple extension of the SM that can be motivated by many problems, including the need for new sources of CP violation to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. We were successful in calculating the Hilbert series for the VLQ extension in the mass basis of the VLQ, where the spurion transformations are simpler. Based on the Hilbert series, we build and enumerate the basic flavor invariants with which all invariants can be constructed. For a generic basis, where the spurion transformations involve a larger group, we could only get the first few terms of the Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>CP Violation and Flavour-Violating Di-Higgs Couplings in the Randall-Sundrum Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Randall-Sundrum (RS) model offers a compelling framework to address the hierarchy problem and provides new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model (SM). The motivation for studying CP violation in the RS model arises from the insufficiency of CP-violating phases in the SM to account for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we explore CP violation through flavour-violating di-Higgs couplings, which emerge due to the localization of bulk fermions and the Higgs near the TeV brane. The analysis focuses on the role of these couplings in di-Higgs production and decay processes, leading to enhanced CP-violating effects. Numerical simulations show that the predicted CP-violating observables are within experimental bounds and could be tested in future collider experiments. The study concludes that flavour-violating di-Higgs couplings in the RS model offer a promising avenue for discovering new sources of CP violation, with significant implications for both collider physics and the understanding of the matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermal Production of Axions from Heavy Higgs Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal production of axions in renormalizable models involving two Higgs doublet fields and a complex singlet field with a global $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, i.e., DFSZ type axion models. We demonstrate that, when the reheating temperature exceeds the mass scale of heavy Higgs bosons, axions are efficiently produced through heavy Higgs boson decays and scatterings at temperatures comparable to the heavy Higgs boson mass scale. As a result, the abundance of thermally produced axions is independent of the reheating temperature, which should be contrasted with the KSVZ axion model. This is because thermal productions via renormalizable interactions are IR-dominated processes. We demonstrate that the heavy Higgs boson decays are the main channels for axion thermal productions among various processes in the DFSZ-type axion models, which were missed in the literature. Our results apply to the original DFSZ QCD axion model since the production mechanism does not depend on the axion mass. As an application of axion productions from the heavy Higgs boson decays, we calculate the contributions to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ for axions with a mass smaller than ${\cal O}(0.1){\rm eV}$. Future measurements of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ could constrain model parameters in both axion and Higgs sectors. Focusing on axions with masses from keV to sub-GeV scale, we then discuss how cosmological observations such as X-ray and cosmic microwave background constrain the produced axion. We show that a large portion of the parameter space of the models can be explored even if the amount of the axion produced from the heavy Higgs bosons is much smaller than the observed cold dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Approaches for BSM Physics: Evaluating DNN and GNN Performance in Particle Collision Event Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting Beyond Standard Model (BSM) signals in high-energy particle collisions presents significant challenges due to complex data and the need to differentiate rare signal events from Standard Model (SM) backgrounds. This study investigates the efficacy of deep learning models, specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), in classifying particle collision events as either BSM signal or background. The research utilized a dataset comprising 214,000 SM background and 10,755 BSM events. To address class imbalance, an undersampling method was employed, resulting in balanced classes. Three models were developed and compared: a DNN and two GNN variants with different graph construction methods. All models demonstrated high performance, achieving Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) values exceeding $94\%$. While the DNN model slightly outperformed GNNs across various metrics, both GNN approaches showed comparable results despite different graph structures. The GNNs' ability to explicitly capture inter-particle relationships within events highlights their potential for BSM signal detection.</description>

      <title>Heavy Flavor Production at the Large Hadron Collider: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charmonia suppression has been considered as a smoking gun signature of quark-gluon plasma. However, the Large Hadron Collider has observed a lower degree of suppression as compared to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energies, due to regeneration effects in heavy-ion collisions. Though proton collisions are considered to be the baseline measurements to characterize a hot and dense medium formation in heavy-ion collisions, LHC proton collisions with its new physics of heavy-ion-like QGP signatures have created new challenges. To understand this, the inclusive charmonia production at the forward rapidities in the dimuon channel is compared with the corresponding measurements in the dielectron channel at the midrapidity as a function of final state charged particle multiplicity. None of the theoretical models quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings leaving out a lot of room for theory. To circumvent this and find a reasonable understanding, we use machine learning tools to separate prompt and nonprompt charmonia and open charm mesons using the decay daughter track properties and the decay topologies of the mother particles. Using PYTHIA8 data, we train the machine learning models and successfully separate prompt and nonprompt charm hadrons from the inclusive sample to study various directions of their production dynamics. This study enables a domain of using machine learning techniques, which can be used in the experimental analysis to better understand charm hadron production and build possible theoretical understanding.</description>

      <title>A joint explanation of the $B\to \pi K$ puzzle and the $B \to K \nu \bar{\nu}$ excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the recent branching fraction measurement of the $B^{+}\to K^{+} \nu\bar{\nu}$ decay by Belle II and its poor agreement with the SM expectation, we analyze the effects of an axion-like particle (ALP) in $B$ meson decays. We assume a long-lived ALP with a mass of the order of the pion mass that decays to two photons. We focus on a scenario where the ALP decay length is of the order of meters such that the ALP has a non-negligible probability to decay outside the detector volume of Belle II, mimicking the $B^{+}\to K^{+} \nu\bar{\nu}$ signal. Remarkably, such an arrangement is also relevant for the long-standing $B\to \pi K$ puzzle by noting that the measured $B^{0}\to \pi^{0}K^{0}$ and $B^{+}\to \pi^{0}K^{+}$ decays could have a $B^{0}\to a K^{0}$ and $B^{+}\to a K^{+}$ component, respectively. We also argue based on our results that the required ALP-photon effective coupling belongs to a region of parameter space that can be extensively probed in future beam dump experiments like SHiP.</description>

      <title>Data-driven results for light-quark connected and strange-plus-disconnected hadronic $g-2$ short- and long-distance windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key issue affecting the attempt to reduce the uncertainty on the Standard Model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is the current discrepancy between lattice-QCD and data-driven results for the hadronic vacuum polarization. Progress on this issue benefits from precise data-driven determinations of the isospin-limit light-quark-connected (lqc) and strange-plus-light-quark-disconnected (s+lqd) components of the related RBC/UKQCD windows. In this paper, using a strategy employed previously for the intermediate window, we provide data-driven results for the lqc and s+lqd components of the short- and long-distance RBC/UKQCD windows. Comparing these results with those from the lattice, we find significant discrepancies in the lqc parts but good agreement for the s+lqd components. We also explore the impact of recent CMD-3 $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ cross-section results, demonstrating that an upward shift in the $\rho$-peak region of the type seen in the CMD-3 data serves to eliminate the discrepancies for the lqc components without compromising the good agreement between lattice and data-driven s+lqd results.</description>

      <title>Truth, beauty, and goodness in grand unification: a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the flavour sector of the supersymmetric $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) model using machine learning techniques. The minimal $SU(5)$ model is known to predict fermion masses that disagree with observed values in nature. There are two well-known approaches to address this issue: one involves introducing a 45-representation Higgs field, while the other employs a higher-dimensional operator involving the 24-representation GUT Higgs field. We compare these two approaches by numerically optimising a loss function, defined as the ratio of determinants of mass matrices. Our findings indicate that the 24-Higgs approach achieves the observed fermion masses with smaller modifications to the original minimal $SU(5)$ model.</description>

      <title>Isospin-breaking contribution to the model-independent axion-photon-photon coupling in $U(3)$ chiral theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue the calculation of the model-independent component of the axion-photon-photon coupling in the $U(3)$ chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order, with the emphasis on the isospin breaking effect. The mixing of the $\pi^0$-$\eta$-$\eta'$-axion system is revised as well by working out the complete linear isospin-breaking terms. Our calculation shows that the isospin-breaking correction to the axion-photon-photon coupling amounts to more than 15%, comparing with the result in the isospin limit.</description>

      <title>Conversion-Driven Dark Matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new gauge boson $Z'$ in $U(1)_{B-L}$ is widely considered as the mediator of dark matter. In this paper, we propose the conversion-driven dark matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$. The dark sector contains two Dirac fermions $\tilde{\chi}_1$ and $\tilde{\chi}_2$ with $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge 0 and $-1$, respectively. A $Z_2$ symmetry is also introduced to ensure the stability of dark matter. The mass term $\delta m \bar{\tilde{\chi}}_1\tilde{\chi}_2$ induces the mixing of dark fermion. Then the lightest dark fermion $\chi_1$ becomes the dark matter candidate, whose coupling to $Z'$ is suppressed by the mixing angle $\theta$. Instead of freezing-out via pair annihilation, we show that the observed relic abundance can be obtained through the conversion processes. We then explore the feasible parameter space of conversion-driven dark matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$. Under various experimental constraints, the conversion-driven dark matter prefers the region with $3\times10^{-6}\lesssim g'\lesssim2\times10^{-4}$ and $0.02~\text{GeV}\lesssim m_{Z'}\lesssim10$~GeV, which is within the reach of future Belle II, FASER and SHiP.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Effect of QGP Droplet and Self-similarity Effect of Hadrons on QGP-hadron Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary effect of QGP droplet and self-similarity effect of hadrons on QGP-hadron phase transition. In intermediate or low energy collisions, when the transverse momentum is below QCD scale, QGP cannot be produced. However, if the transverse momentum fluctuates to a relatively large value, small scale QGP droplet is produced. The modified MIT bag model with multiple reflection expansion method is employed to study the QGP droplet with the curved boundary effect. It is found that the energy density, entropy density and pressure of QGP with the influence are smaller than those without the influence. In hadron phase, we propose Two-Body Fractal Model (TBFM) to study the self-similarity structure, arising from the resonance, quantum correlation and interaction effects. It is observed that energy density, entropy density and pressure increase due to the self-similarity structure. We calculate the transverse momentum spectra of pions with the self-similarity structure influence, showing a good agreement with the experimental data. Considering both the boundary effect and self-similarity structure influence, our model predicts an increase in the transition temperature compared to scenarios without these two effects in HIAF energy region $2.2\sim 4.5 \,\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $SU(5)$ Yukawa Sectors Through Quantum Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article revisits the validity of tree-level statements regarding the Yukawa sector of various minimal-renormalisable $SU(5)$ frameworks at the loop level. It is well-known that an $SU(5)$ model with only the $45_{\rm{H}}$ dimensional irreducible representation~(irrep) contributing to the Yukawa sector is highly incompatible in yielding the low-energy observables. However, this study shows that when one-loop corrections from heavy degrees of freedom are included in the various Yukawa vertices, the model can accurately reproduce the charged fermion mass spectrum and mixing angles. Furthermore, the fitted couplings remain within the perturbative range. The fitted parameters also necessitate mass splitting among various scalars of $45_{\rm{H}}$ dimensional irrep, with at least one scalar's mass differing by as much as 13 orders of magnitude from the matching scale $(M_{\rm{GUT}})$, collectively providing substantial threshold corrections. As an extension, the minimal $SU(5)$ model with only the $45_{\rm{H}}$ irrep is augmented with the $15_{\rm{H}}$-dimensional irrep, which also successfully reproduces the observed charged and neutral fermion mass spectra. Finally, the study considers an alternative $SU(5)$ model incorporating both $5_{\rm{H}}$ and $15_{\rm{H}}$ irreps, which also yields the desired fermion mass spectra and mixing angles. This work demonstrates the viability of a minimal $SU(5)$ Yukawa sector in different setups when quantum corrections are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the nonlocal generalization of the QCD chiral anomaly along the light-cone and derive relations between twist-two, twist-three and twist-four generalized parton distributions (GPDs) mediated by the anomaly. We further establish the connection to the `anomaly pole' in the GPD $\tilde{E}$ recently identified in the perturbative calculation of the Compton scattering amplitudes, and demonstrate its cancellation at the GPD level. Our work helps elucidate the previously unexplored connection between GPDs, the chiral anomaly, and the mass generation of the $\eta'$ meson.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of a four-fermion model with CP violation: implications to spontaneous CP violation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work on the functional renormalization group analysis on a four-fermion model with the CP and P violation in light of nonperturbative exploration of the infrared dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) arising from the spontaneous CP violation models in a view of the Wilsonian renormalization group. The fixed point structure reveals that in the large-$N_c$ limit, the CP $\bar{\theta}$ parameter is induced and approaches $\pi \cdot (N_f/2)$ (with the number of flavors $N_f$) toward the chiral broken phase due to the criticality and the large anomalous dimensions of the $U(1)$ axial violating four-fermion couplings. This trend seems to be intact even going beyond the large-$N_c$ leading, as long as the infrared dynamics of QCD is governed by the scalar condensate of the quark bilinear as desired. This gives an impact on modeling of the spontaneous CP violation scenarios: the perturbatively irrelevant four-fermion interactions nonperturbatively get relevant in the chiral broken phase, implying that the neutron electric dipole moment becomes too big, unless cancellations due to extra CP and P violating contributions outside of QCD are present at a certain intermediate infrared scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reexamine a dynamical dark matter model with Kaluza-Klein (KK) towers of gravitons and neutrinos fitting together in the dark dimension. We show that even though gravitational decays of neutrino KK towers have little impact in cosmology the weak decay channel could have significant cosmological effects. Taking conservative upper bounds on the dark matter decay rate into two photons before recombination and on the number of effective extra neutrino species $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ we derive constraints on the conversion rate from active to sterile species despite the dependence of the mixing angle on the KK mode mass. We also provide counterarguments to a recent claim suggesting that the bounds on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ rule out micron-sized extra dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically calculate one- and two-loop helicity amplitudes in massless QED, by adopting a four-dimensional tensor decomposition. We draw our attention to four-fermion and Compton scattering processes to higher orders in the dimensional regulator, as required for theoretical predictions at N$^3$LO. We organise loop amplitudes by proposing an efficient algorithm at integrand level to group Feynman graphs into integral families. We study the singular structure of these amplitudes and discuss the correspondence between QED and QCD processes. We present our results in terms of generalised polylogarithms up to transcendental weight six.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), as defined in full QCD, plays a key role in the collinear factorization for exclusive heavy meson production and in lattice computations of the LCDA within heavy-quark effective theory (HQET). In addition to its dependence on the renormalization scale, the QCD LCDA also evolves with the heavy quark mass. We derive a partial differential equation to characterize the mass evolution of the heavy meson QCD LCDA, examining the heavy quark mass dependence through its solution. Our results link the internal structure of heavy mesons across different quark masses, offering significant implications for lattice calculations and enabling the extrapolation of results from lower to higher quark masses.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the proton$\text{-}$box contribution to the hadronic light$\text{-}$by$\text{-}$light part of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, which is the first reported baryonic contribution to this piece. We follow the quark$\text{-}$loop analysis, incorporating the relevant data$\text{-}$driven and lattice proton form factors. Although the heavy mass expansion would yield a contribution of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$, the damping of the form factors in the regions where the kernel peaks, explains our finding $a_{\mu}^{\rm{p-box}}=1.82 (7)\times 10^{-12}$, two orders of magnitude smaller than the forthcoming uncertainty on the $a_{\mu}$ measurement and on its Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>wilson: A package for renormalization group running in the SMEFT with Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are well-motivated beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles. The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) augmented with these new fields is known as the $\nu$SMEFT. We present the first code for solving the renormalization group equations (RGEs) of the $\nu$SMEFT in an automated way. For this purpose, we have implemented the $\nu$SMEFT as a new effective field theory (EFT) in the Wilson coefficient exchange format WCxf. Furthermore, we included anomalous dimensions depending on the gauge couplings and Yukawas in the python package wilson. This novel version of wilson allows a consistent inclusion of $\nu$SMEFT renormalization group (RG) running effects above the electroweak (EW) scale in phenomenological studies involving sterile neutrinos. Moreover, this new release allows us to study EW, strong, and Yukawa running effects separately within the SMEFT.</description>

      <title>Gravitational production of massive vectors non-minimally coupled to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum theory of massive Abelian vector bosons with non-minimal couplings to gravity has been studied within an evolving, isotropic, and homogeneous gravitational background. The vectors may play a role of dark matter if stabilizing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed. In order to construct a gauge invariant theory of massive vectors that couple to the Ricci scalar and Ricci tensor, a generalization of the Stuckelberg mechanism has been invoked. Constraints that ensure consistency of the model had been formulated and corresponding restrictions upon the space of non-minimal couplings have been found. Canonical quantization of the theory in evolving gravitational background was adopted. Mode equations for longitudinally and transversally-polarized vector bosons were derived and solved numerically. Regions of exponential growth in the solutions of the mode equations have been determined and discussed in detail. The spectral energy density for the three polarizations has been calculated, and the UV divergence of the integrated total energy density has been addressed. Finally, assuming their stability, the present abundance of the vector bosons has also been calculated.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement and spectral split correlations in three-flavor collective neutrino oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In environments with prodigious numbers of neutrinos, such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, or the early universe, neutrino-neutrino interactions are dynamically significant. They can dominate neutrino flavor evolution and force it to be nonlinear, causing collective neutrino oscillations. Such collective oscillations have been studied numerically, for systems with up to millions of neutrinos, using mean-field or one-particle effective approximations. However, such a system of interacting neutrinos is a quantum many-body system, wherein quantum correlations could play a significant in the flavor evolution-thereby motivating the exploration of many-body treatments which follow the time evolution of these correlations. In many-body flavor evolution calculations with two neutrino flavors, the emergence of spectral splits in the neutrino energy distributions has been found to be correlated with the degree of quantum entanglement across the spectrum. In this work, for the first time, we investigate the emergence of spectral-splits in the three-flavor many-body collective neutrino oscillations. We find that the emergence of spectral splits resembles the number and location found in the mean-field approximation but not in the width. Moreover, unlike in the two-flavor many-body calculations, we find that additional degrees of freedom make it more difficult to establish a correlation between the location of the spectral splits and the degree of quantum entanglement across the neutrino energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around $10^6\,M_\odot/\textrm{pc}^3$ across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>String Breaking in the Heavy Quark Limit with Scalable Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories require efficient mappings onto quantum computers and practical state preparation and measurement procedures. A truncation of the Hilbert space of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter in the heavy quark limit is developed. This truncation is applied to $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1D$ to map the theory efficiently onto a quantum computer. Scalable variational circuits are found to prepare the vacuum and single meson states. It is also shown how these state preparation circuits can be used to perform measurements of the number of mesons produced during the system's time evolution. A state with a single $q\overline{q}$ pair is prepared on quantum hardware and the inelastic production of $q\overline{q}$ pairs is observed using $104$ qubits on IBM's Heron quantum computer ibm_torino.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to compute the pion transition form factors directly at arbitrary photon momenta and use it to determine the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The calculation is performed using eight gauge ensembles generated with 2+1 flavor domain wall fermions, incorporating multiple pion masses, lattice spacings, and volumes. By introducing a pion structure function and performing a Gegenbauer expansion, we demonstrate that about 98% of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution can be extracted in a model-independent manner, thereby ensuring that systematic effects are well controlled. After applying finite-volume corrections, as well as performing chiral and continuum extrapolations, we obtain the final result for the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scatterintg in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\mu}^{\pi^0\mathrm{-pole}}=59.6(2.2)\times 10^{-11}$, and the $\pi^0$ decay width, $\Gamma_{\pi^0\to \gamma\gamma}=7.20(35)\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Measuring cosmic curvature with non-CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic curvature $\Omega_{K}$ is an important parameter related to the inflationary cosmology and the ultimate fate of the universe. In this work, we adopt the non-CMB observations to constrain $\Omega_{K}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions. The DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, DES type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data are considered. We find that the data combination favors an open universe in the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically $\Omega_{K}=0.108\pm0.056$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, which is in $2.6\sigma$ tension with the Planck CMB result supporting our universe being slightly closed. In the $\Lambda$CDM extensions, the data combination is consistent with a spatially flat universe. However, the central value of $\Omega_{K}$ is positive and has a significant deviation from zero. We adopt the Akaike information criterion to compare different cosmological models. The result shows that non-flat models fit the observational data better that the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which adds evidence to the argument that flat $\Lambda$CDM is not the ultimate model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy and cosmological constant in QFT in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological constant term (CC), $\Lambda$, is a pivotal ingredient in the standard model of cosmology or $\Lambda$CDM, but it is a rigid quantity for the entire cosmic history. This is unnatural and inconsistent. Different theoretical and phenomenological conundrums suggest that the $\Lambda$CDM necessitates further theoretical underpinning to cope with modern observations. An interesting approach is the framework of the `running vacuum model' (RVM). It endows $\Lambda$ with cosmic dynamics within a fundamental framework since it is based on QFT. In the RVM, the vacuum energy density (VED) appears as a series of powers of the Hubble function and its derivatives, $\rho_{\rm vac} (H, \dot{H},...)$. In the current universe, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ changes as $\sim H^2$. Higher order effects ${\cal O}(H^4)$, on the other hand, can be responsible for a new mechanism of inflation (RVM-inflation). On the practical side the RVM can alleviate the cosmological tensions on $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$. An intriguing smoking gun signature of the RVM is that its equation of state can mimic quintessence, as recently observed by DESI, so the vacuum can be the sought-for dynamical DE. At a deeper theoretical level, the RVM-renormalized form of the VED can avoid extreme fine tuning related to the well-known cosmological constant problem. Overall, the RVM has the capacity to impinge positively on relevant theoretical and practical aspects of modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Finite nuclei in an extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theoretical framework to investigate the properties of finite nuclei based on an extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (eNJL) model, where the Dirac sea, the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and the quark degrees of freedom are considered by extending the SU(3) NJL model and treating baryons as clusters of quarks. The eNJL model can then be readily adopted to examine the matter states ranging from baryonic matter to quark matter in a unified manner. In this work, by assuming spherically symmetric finite nuclei and neglecting the center-of-mass or rotational corrections, we systematically investigate the properties of finite nuclei based on the eNJL model with additional pairing correlations. It is found that our model generally reproduces the binding energies of the 2495 nuclei ($A&gt;2$) from the 2016 Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2016) with the root-mean-square deviations $5.38$ MeV. The deviations are mainly attributed to the too large shell gaps at magic numbers $N(Z) =28$, 50, and 82 as well as the spurious shell closures at $N(Z)=34$, 58, and 92. Meanwhile, the obtained charge radii of 906 nuclei are systematically smaller than the experimental values with root-mean-square deviations $0.127$ fm. In our future study, we expect to reduce the uncertainties of our predictions by carefully calibrating the density dependence of coupling constants and considering deformations with microscopic collective corrections from the nucleons in the Fermi sea and quarks in the Dirac sea.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: technical details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, we develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators can quickly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) in a parameter space that encompasses the complex energy plane as well as other real-valued parameters in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and resolvent matrix elements with branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, we now have a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates them in the input parameter space. Some significant results have previously been presented in a short report (arXiv:2408.03309). Here, we provide details of the study and an in-depth analysis, including how this method could be coupled with existing approaches to compute and emulate bound and continuum states.</description>

      <title>The effective speed of sound in cosmological perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multi-field/fluid cosmological system consisting of a number of minimally coupled canonical scalar fields, non-canonical scalar fields and barotropic perfect fluids, we introduce a new definition of effective speed of sound of the entire system for describing the evolution of cosmological perturbations. This effective speed of sound is not just gauge invariant but also a background dependent quantity and therefore can be treated as a parameter to quantify perturbations in such multi-field/fluid systems. It is with this effective speed that the gauge invariant Bardeen potential and the curvature perturbation propagate at scales much smaller than the sound horizon. Further, the effective speed of sound defined in this paper generalizes the one defined by Garriga and Mukhanov for a single non-canonical scalar field to a system consisting of many minimally coupled barotropic perfect fluids, canonical and non-canonical scalar fields. Moreover, just like in the case of a single pure-kinetic non-canonical scalar field, this effective speed of the sound of the total system turns out to be identically equal to the total adiabatic speed of sound when the dynamic of the universe is driven by a number of pure kinetic non-canonical scalar fields making such a system tantamount to a system of equivalent multi barotropic perfect fluids. We also derive a set of equations which governs the evolution of perturbations in a general multi-field/fluid universe containing barotropic perfect fluids, canonical and non-canonical scalar fields. Using these equations we show that, in the large scale limit ($k = 0$ scales), if the perturbations are initially adiabatic, then it continues to remain so at that scales throughout the evolution of the universe. Consequently, at that scales, such multi-field/fluid universe dynamically behaves as if it contains only a single barotropic perfect fluid.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>On Sphaleron Heating in the Presence of Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles with a coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields at finite temperature can experience dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This could play an important role for warm inflation or dynamical dark energy. We investigate to what degree the efficiency of this non-perturbative mechanism depends on the details of the underlying particle physics model. For a wide range of scenarios and energy scales, we find that a previously discussed suppression of sphaleron heating by light fermions can be alleviated. As an outlook, we point out that fermionic effects may provide a new mechanism for ending warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Consistent, multidimensional differential histogramming and summary statistics with YODA 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histogramming is often taken for granted, but the power and compactness of partially aggregated, multidimensional summary statistics, and their fundamental connection to differential and integral calculus make them formidable statistical objects, especially when very large data volumes are involved. But expressing these concepts robustly and efficiently in high-dimensional parameter spaces and for large data samples is a highly non-trivial challenge -- doubly so if the resulting library is to remain usable by scientists as opposed to software engineers. In this paper we summarise the core principles required for consistent generalised histogramming, and use them to motivate the design principles and implementation mechanics of the re-engineered YODA histogramming library, a key component of physics data-model comparison and statistical interpretation in collider physics.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the most general generating function of reduction for one loop integrals with arbitrary tensor structure in numerator and arbitrary power distribution of propagators in denominator. Using IBP relations, we have established the partial differential equations for these generating functions and solved them analytically. These results provide useful guidance for applying generating function method to reductions of higher loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Study of the axial-vector and tensor resonant contributions to the $D \to VP\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays based on SU(3) flavor analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semileptonic three-body $D \to M\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays, non-leptonic $M \to VP$ decays, and semileptonic four-body $D \to M(M \to VP)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays are analyzed using the SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking approach, where $\ell=e/\mu$, $M=A/T$, and $A/T/V/P$ denote the axial-vector/tensor/vector/pseudoscalar mesons, respectively. In terms of SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking, the decay amplitudes of the $D \to M \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ decays and the vertex coefficients of the $M \to VP$ decays are related. The relevant non-perturbative parameters of the $D \to A\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $A \to VP$ and $T \to VP$ decays are constrained by the present experimental data, and the non-perturbative parameters of $D \to T\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays are taken from the results in the light-front quark model since no experimental data are available at present. The branching ratios of the $D \to M \ell^+ \nu_\ell $, $M \to VP$, and $D\to M(M\to VP)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays are then predicted. We find that some processes receive both tensor and axial-vector resonant contributions, while other processes receive only axial-vector resonant contributions. In cases where both kinds of resonant contributions exist, the axial-vector contributions are dominant. Some branching ratios with axial-vector resonance states are large, and they may be measured experimentally in the near future. In addition, the sensitivities of the branching ratios of $D \to A \ell^+ \nu_\ell $ and $A \to VP$ decays to the parameters are also investigated, and some decay branching ratios are found to be sensitive to the non-perturbative parameters.</description>

      <title>Conversion-Driven Leptogenesis: A Testable Theory of Dark Matter and Baryogenesis at the Electroweak Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomena of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry pose two of the most pressing questions in today's fundamental physics. Conversion-driven freeze-out has emerged as a successful mechanism to generate the observed dark matter relic density. It supports thermalization of dark matter despite its very weak couplings aligning with the null results from direct and indirect detection experiments. In this letter, we demonstrate that the departure from equilibrium of dark matter, induced by semi-efficient conversions, satisfies Sakharov's conditions, providing a novel explanation for both dark matter and the baryon asymmetry. Specifically, for a leptophilic model, we establish the mechanism of conversion-driven leptogenesis. The scenario predicts dark matter masses close to the electroweak scale offering testable predictions, such as soft displaced leptons at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can alter the neutrino propagation distance and thus affect neutrino oscillations. This can result in a complete disappearance of the oscillatory behavior that competes with other sources of neutrino decoherence. We develop a set of criteria that determines under which conditions neutrino oscillations are sensitive to this effect. We find that current or near future neutrino oscillation experiments are not sufficiently sensitive to coherent GW signals but may probe the stochastic gravitational wave background if the energy resolution improves drastically by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Axion-Induced Patchy Screening of the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons can undergo resonant conversion into axions in the presence of magnetized plasma distributed inside non-linear large-scale structure (LSS). This process leads to axion-induced patchy screening: secondary temperature and polarization anisotropies with a characteristic non-blackbody frequency dependence that are strongly correlated with the distribution of LSS along our past light cone. We compute the axion-induced patchy screening contribution to two- and three- point correlation functions that include CMB anisotropies and tracers of LSS within the halo model. We use these results to forecast the sensitivity of existing and future surveys to photon-axion couplings for axion masses between $2\times 10^{-13}$ eV and $3\times 10^{-12}$ eV, using a combination of empirical estimates from Planck data of the contribution from instrumental noise and foregrounds as well as modeled contributions on angular scales only accessible with future datasets. We demonstrate that an analysis using Planck and the unWISE galaxy catalogue would be complementary to the most sensitive existing astrophysical axion searches, probing couplings as small as $3\times 10^{-12} \, {\rm GeV}^{-1}$, while observations from a future survey such as CMB-S4 could extend this reach by almost an additional order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Topological amplitudes of charmed baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charmed baryon decay plays an important role in studying the weak and strong interactions. Topological diagram is an intuitive tool for analyzing the dynamics of heavy hadron decays. In this work, we investigate the topological diagrams of charmed baryon antitriplet ($\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}$) decays into a light baryon octet ($\mathcal{B}_8$) and a light meson ($M$). The topological diagrams of the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_8^S M$ modes (where $\mathcal{B}_8^S$ and $\mathcal{B}_8^A$ are the $q_1\leftrightarrow q_2$ symmetric and antisymmetric octets) and the diagrams with a quark loop are presented for the first time. The completeness of topologies is confirmed by permutation. The linear relations of topologies are obtained by deriving the relation between the topological amplitudes constructed by the third- and second-rank octet tensors. The equations of $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes decomposed by topologies are derived through two different intermediate amplitudes. However, the inverse solution does not exist since the number of topologies exceeds number of $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes. Applying this framework to the Standard Model, it is found there are thirteen independent $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_8 M$ decays. Among these, four amplitudes associated with three-dimensional operators are significant for $CP$ asymmetries. Considering the suppressions due to small Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ and the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem, the branching fractions of charmed baryon decays are dominated by five $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes in the $SU(3)_F$ limit.</description>

      <title>Pion photoproduction of nucleon excited states with Hamiltonian effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine our previous calculation of multipole amplitude $E_{0+}$ for pion photoproduction process, $\gamma N\rightarrow\pi N$. The treatment of final-state interactions is based upon an earlier analysis of pion-nucleon scattering within Hamiltonian effective field theory, supplemented by incorporating contributions from the $N^*(1650)$ and the $K\Lambda$ coupled channel. The contribution from the bare state corresponding to the $N^*(1650)$ significantly enhances our results. Additionally, we also compute the multipole amplitude $M_{1-}$, which is of direct relevance to the Roper resonance. The results are comparable with other dynamical coupled channel models, even though the contribution from the bare state (interpreted as a 2$s$ excitation) in this channel is small because of its large mass.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\lambda_{B_s}$ by $B_s\to \gamma^*$ and $B_s\to \phi$ form factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the form factors $F_{V}(q^2,q'^2)$ and $F_{TV}(q^2,q'^2)$ describing the $B_s\to \gamma^*$ transition induced by the vector and tensor weak currents in a broad range of values of $q^2$ and $q'^2$ far below the quark thresholds in both $q^2$ and $q'^2$ channels. These form factors are calculated via the distribution amplitudes of the $B_s$-meson. We then interpolate the obtained results by a formula that contains pole at $q'^2=M_\phi^2$ and extract the residue which gives the $B_s\to \phi$ transition form factors $V(q^2)$ and $T_1(q^2)$. In this way we obtain theoretical predictions for these form factors without invoking quark-hadron duality and QCD sum rules. Furthermore, we calculate the relationship between $V(0)$ and $T_1(0)$ and the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}(\mu)$, the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson distribution amplitude. Using the available predictions for $V(0)$ and $T_1(0)$ coming from approaches not referring to the $B_s$-meson distribution amplitudes, we obtain the estimate $\lambda_{B_s}(\mu\simeq m_b)=(0.62\pm 0.10)$ GeV.</description>

      <title>An alternative way to decipher the nature of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$: its antiparticle $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ photoproduction off nuclei near threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inclusive photoproduction of $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ mesons (which are the antiparticles of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ discovered recently by the LHCb Collaboration) from nuclei in the near-threshold energy region within the nuclear spectral function approach by considering incoherent direct (${\gamma}p(n) \to D^+(D^0){T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-}\Lambda^+_c$) photon--nucleon $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ creation processes as well as five possible different scenarios for their internal structure with the main goal of clarifying the possibility to decipher this structure (and, hence, that of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$) in photoproduction via integral and differential observables. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ as well as the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson intrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed high-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the near-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal structure.</description>

Abstract: Sphaleron electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is calculated in two phase transition stages, thereby showing that the twin (or double) bubble nucleation structure of the phase transition and gravitational wave is in the investigation area of future detectors. With $v^2=v^2_1+v^2_2$ ($v_1$ and $v_2$ are two vacuum average values (VEV)), the parameter $\tan\beta=v_2/v_1$, is the ratio between two VEVs although it does not affect the strength of EWPT but affect the sphaleron energy. However, it only causes this energy to increase slightly. As $a=v^2/v_2^2$ increases, the maximum difference of sphaleron energy in one stage is about $6.15$ TeV. $a$ affects the expansion of bubbles during two phase transitions. The more $a$ increases, the more the expansion of two bubbles is at the same time. This ratio does not greatly affect the sphaleron energy but has an impact on gravitational waves. The larger the masses of the charged Higgs particles are, the greater the gravitational wave energy density ($\Omega h^2$) is. When the frequency is in the range $0-1.2$ mHz, $\Omega h^2$ will has a maximum value in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-11}$ for all values of $a$ so this can be detected in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of the pion DF and proton spin developments are sketched herein, along with some novel perspectives on gluon and quark orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a microscopic dynamical model to study the formation, dissociation, and recombination processes of charmonium states in a heat bath at constant temperature and volume. Within this classical approach, heavy quarks are described as Brownian particles in a background medium of light constituents and can therefore be modeled by a Fokker-Planck equation with constant transport coefficients, which is then implemented through relativistic Langevin simulations. The heavy quarks interact classically via a Coulomb-like screened potential to form a bound state if the relative energy of the pair becomes negative. Dissociation of bound states is possible as a result of screening effects on the potential as well as through scatterings with plasma particles. We demonstrate the full equilibration of the system and show that the resulting equilibrium charmonium yields are in accordance with the Statistical Hadronization Model.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Induced Thermal Friction on Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling jump and small instantons from a large non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a scalar field couples to the Ricci scalar with a large non-minimal coupling, the Standard Model coupling parameters can differ above and below an intermediate field range of the scalar due to the non-renormalizability. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the threshold effects on a gauge coupling in both Metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. We find that the gauge coupling naturally jumps around this intermediate scale since counter terms for the renormalization behave so. If the gauge coupling becomes strong with a large scalar field value due to this effect, there can be an enhanced small instanton contribution, the dilute gas approximation of which is justified because the gauge sector decouples when the scalar wave mode is very short. Using these findings, we discuss the QCD axion quality problem, the heavy QCD axion, the QCD axion abundance, and the suppression of isocurvature perturbations. We show that axion physics may differ substantially from na\"{i}ve expectations when we introduce a large non-minimal coupling for any scalar field.</description>

      <title>Predicting New Above-Threshold Molecular States Via Triangular Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering that the experimentally observed molecular states are significantly fewer than those predicted theoretically, and that these states are traditionally classified as lying below thresholds while several candidates are found above them, we propose to broaden the definition of molecular states to include those that exist just above the thresholds. Identifying resonance peaks in invariant mass distributions and scattering cross-sections is crucial for probing these states, yet the mechanisms responsible for such enhancements remain unclear, complicating our understanding of new particle production. While the peaks linked to triangular singularities do not correspond to true hadronic states, the associated production mechanisms may provide valuable insight into the search for genuine hadrons. In this work, we propose employing the triangular singularity mechanism to theoretically investigate yet-to-be-observed molecular states, particularly those that could test heavy quark symmetry. We argue that these states may have true masses surpassing the thresholds of their constituent components, rather than being predicted to be below them by theoretical models. Our findings suggest the possible existence of 16 additional heavy quark molecular states, including $X(4014)$, $Z_{cs}(4123)$, $Y(4320)$, $Z(4430)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$, which are posited to contain $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$, $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}_{s}$, $D_1\bar{D}$, $D_1\bar{D}^{*}$, and $B_{1}(5721)\bar{B}$ constituents, respectively. The recognition of these states would substantiate heavy quark symmetry and enhance our understanding of hadronic dynamics and molecular states formation.</description>

      <title>Monochromatization of $e^+e^-$ colliders with a large crossing angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13668v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relative center-of-mass energy spread at $e^+e^-$ colliders is about $10^{-3}$, which is much larger than the widths of narrow resonances J/$\psi$, $\psi$(2S), $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S), $\Upsilon$(3S) mesons, tauonium and some others. It's reduction would significantly increase the resonance production rates and open up great opportunities in the search for new physics. In this paper, we propose a new monochromatization method for colliders with a large crossing angle (which can provide a high luminosity). The contribution of the beam energy spread to the spread of the center-of-mass energy is canceled by introducing an appropriate energy-angle correlation at the interaction point; $\sigma_W/W \sim (0.5-1)10^{-5}$ appears possible.</description>

      <title>Tetraquark systems $\bar bb\bar du$ in the static limit and lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two hadrons with exotic quark content $Z_b^+\simeq \bar bb \bar du$ were discovered by Belle. We present a lattice study of the $\bar bb\bar du$ systems with various quantum numbers using static bottom quarks. Only one set of quantum numbers that couples to $Z_b$ and $\Upsilon\;\pi$ was explored on the lattice before; these studies found an attractive potential between $B$ and $\bar B^*$ resulting in a bound state below the threshold. The present study considers the other three sets of quantum numbers. Eigenenergies of the $\bar bb \bar du$ system are extracted as a function of separation between $b$ and $\bar b$. The resulting eigenenergies do not show any sizable deviation from noninteracting energies of the systems $\bar bb+\bar du$ and $\bar bu+\bar db$, so no significant attraction or repulsion is found. A slight exception is a small attraction between $B$ and $\bar B^*$ at small distance for the quantum number that couples to $Z_b$ and $\eta_b\;\rho$.</description>

      <title>One-loop thermal radiation exchange in gravitational wave power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation-dominated universe is a key ingredient of the standard Big Bang cosmology. Radiation comprises numerous quantum elementary particles, and the macroscopic behavior of radiation is described by taking the quantum thermal average of its constituents. While the interactions between individual particles and gravitational waves are often neglected in this context, it raises the question of whether these elementary particles interact with gravitational waves in the framework of quantum field theory. To address this question, this paper aims to explore the quantum mechanical aspects of gravitational waves in a universe dominated by a massless scalar field, whose averaged energy-momentum tensor plays the role of background radiation. We establish the equivalence between the classical Einstein equation and the mean-field approximation of the Heisenberg equation in a local thermal state. Beyond the mean-field approximation, we analyze the quantum corrections to gravitational waves, particularly focusing on the thermal radiation loop corrections. Interestingly, we find the 1-loop correction surpasses the tree-level spectrum of primordial gravitational waves, which is $O(\alpha^2)$ where $\alpha=H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm pl}$ is the ratio of the inflationary Hubble parameter to the Planck mass. Then, to see if this result persists even if we take into account all the higher order loop corrections, the loop expansion is reorganized in the series expansion in $\alpha$. We schematically discuss two-loop diagrams that may give $O(\alpha^2)$ contributions. We leave explicit computations of these diagrams for future studies. Thus, although we cannot claim that the whole loop corrections exceed the tree-level spectrum at the moment, our findings highlight the significance of quantum effects when studying the interaction between radiation and gravitational waves in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Gluonic evanescent operators: negative-norm states and complex anomalous dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build on our previous work to further investigate the role of evanescent operators in gauge theories, with a particular focus on their contribution to violations of unitarity. We develop an efficient method for calculating the norms of gauge-invariant operators in Yang-Mills (YM) theory by employing on-shell form factors. Our analysis, applicable to general spacetime dimensions, reveals the existence of negative norm states among evanescent operators. We also explore the one-loop anomalous dimensions of these operators and find complex anomalous dimensions. We broaden our analysis by considering YM theory coupled with scalar fields and we observe similar patterns of non-unitarity. The presence of negative norm states and complex anomalous dimensions across these analyses provides compelling evidence that general gauge theories are non-unitary in non-integer spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Some exact Green function solutions for non-linear classical field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider some non-linear non-homogeneous partial differential equations (PDEs) and derive their exact Green function solution as a functional Taylor expansion in powers of the source. The kind of PDEs we consider are dispersive ones where the exact solution of the corresponding homogeneous equations can have some known shape. The technique has a formal similarity with the Dyson--Schwinger set of equations to solve quantum field theories. However, there are no physical constraints. Indeed, we show that a complete coincidence with the statistical field model of a quartic scalar theory can be achieved in the Gaussian expansion of the cumulants of the partition function.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, both analytically and numerically, that non-Gaussian tails in the probability density function of curvature perturbations arise in ultra-slow-roll inflation from the $\delta N$ formalism, without invoking stochastic inflation. Previously reported discrepancies between both approaches are a consequence of not correctly accounting for momentum perturbations. Once they are taken into account, both approaches agree to an excellent degree. The shape of the tail depends strongly on the phase space of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Positivity properties of scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate positivity properties in quantum field theory (QFT). We provide evidence,and in some case proofs, that many building blocks of scattering amplitudes, and in some cases the full amplitudes, satisfy an infinite number of positivity conditions: the functions, as well as all their signed derivatives, are non-negative in a specified kinematic region. Such functions are known as completely monotonic(CM) in the mathematics literature. A powerful way to certify complete monotonicity is via integral representations. We thus show that it applies to planar and non-planar Feynman integrals possessing a Euclidean region,as well as to certain Euler integrals relevant to cosmological correlators and stringy integrals. This implies that in particular that many basic building blocks of perturbation theory, such as master integrals, can be chosen to be completely monotone. We also discuss two pathways for showing complete monotonicity for full amplitudes. One is related to properties of the analytic S-matrix. The other one is a close connection between the CM property and Positive Geometry. Motivated by this, we investigate positivity properties in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present evidence, based on known analytic multi-loop results, that the CM property extends to several physical quantities in this theory. This includes the (suitably normalized) finite remainder function of the six-particle maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitude, four-point scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch,four-point correlation functions, as well as the angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. Our findings are however not limited to supersymmetric theories. It is shown that the CM property holds for the QCD and QED cusp anomalous dimensions, to three and four loops, respectively. We comment on open questions, and on possible numerical applications of complete monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that the overall N$^2$LO contribution is centered around $-(5$-$10)\%$ for the shell model and $+(10$-$15)\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the scale dependence of the ultrasoft NMEs and the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Within uncertainties, our results for the ultrasoft NME are of similar size as contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the production of dark radiation (DR) from axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) as potential origins of dark matter. Focusing on the dark matter misalignment mechanism, we examine non-thermal, pre-inflationary scenarios that could lead to the generation of DR. A key part of our analysis involves a Bayesian approach to confront ALP parameter space with current cosmological data. Additionally, we explore whether DR production could offer solutions to persistent cosmological anomalies, particularly those related to the Hubble constant $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ parameter discrepancy. Our findings aim to shed new light on the role of ALPs in addressing these open issues in cosmology.</description>
