      <title>Story of an architecturally suggestive polyhedron: from medieval trade to Renaissance art and modern design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a balance weight dated to the Early Islamic Period from the Hecht Museum at the University of Haifa (Israel) Its polyhedral shape was attributed to a truncated elongated octagonal bipyramid. To our knowledge, the earliest Renaissance book containing the image of this polyhedron is "La Pratica di Prospettiva" published in 1596 by Florentine architect and perspective artist Lorenzo Sirigatti. We described an outline of Sirigatti life and the importance of his book for scientists and artists, Galileo Galilei among them. We depict examples of lamps and lanterns in European cities shaped as the truncated elongated octagonal bipyramid, as well as a drawing by Raphael with a lantern of a similar form. Finally, we discussed why the artist chose this particular polyhedron for his drawing.</description>

      <title>Book I of Euclid's Elements and application of areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work through Book I of Euclid's Elements with our focus on application of areas (I.42, I.44, I.45). We summarize alternate constructions from medieval editions of Euclid's elements and ancient and medieval commentaries. We remark that Euclid's proof of I.44 involves a seldom commented on use of superposition, but that several medieval editions of Euclid give constructions that avoid the use of superposition. This use of superposition is also avoided in Ralph Abraham's ``VCE: The Visual Constructions of Euclid'' C#12, C#12B at http://www.visual-euclid.org/vce/contents.html
  We collate the figures with the digitized editions of Euclid at (P) Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (BAV), Vat. gr. 190, (F) Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana (BML), Plut. 28.03, (B) Bodleian, MS. D'Orville 301, (V) \"Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. Phil. gr. 31, (b) Biblioteca Comunale dell'Archiginnasio, Collocazione A 19, (p) Biblioth\`eque nationale de France, Grec 2466.</description>

      <title>A cute proof that makes $e$ natural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number $e$ has rich connections throughout mathematics, and has the honor of being the base of the natural logarithm. However, most students finish secondary school (and even university) without suitably memorable intuition for why $e$'s various mathematical properties are related. This article presents a solution.
  Various proofs for all of the mathematical facts in this article have been well-known for years. This exposition contributes a short, conceptual, intuitive, and visual proof (comprehensible to Pre-Calculus students) of the equivalence of two of the most commonly-known properties of $e$, connecting the continuously-compounded-interest limit $\big(1 + \frac{1}{n}\big)^n$ to the fact that $e^x$ is its own derivative. The exposition further deduces a host of commonly-taught properties of $e$, while minimizing pre-requisite knowledge, so that this article can be practically used for developing secondary school curricula.
  Since $e$ is such a well-trodden concept, it is hard to imagine that our visual proof is new, but it certainly is not widely known. The author checked 100 books across 7 countries, as well as YouTube videos totaling over 25 million views, and still has not found this method taught anywhere. This article seeks to popularize the 3-page explanation of $e$, while providing a unified, practical, and open-access reference for teaching about $e$.</description>
