      <title>Estimates for pseudo-differential operators on the torus revisited. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove $L^p$-estimates for H\"ormander classes of pseudo-differential operators on the torus $\mathbb{T}^n$. The results are presented in the context of the global symbolic calculus of Ruzhansky and Turunen on $\mathbb{T}^n\times\mathbb{Z}^n$ by using the discrete Fourier analysis on the torus which extends the usual ($\rho,\delta$)-H\"ormander classes on $\mathbb{T}^n$. The main results extend \'Alvarez and Hounie's method for $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the torus, and Fefferman's $L^p$-boundedness theorem in the toroidal setting allowing the condition $\delta\geq\rho$. When $\delta \leq \rho$, our results recover the available estimates in the literature.</description>

      <title>Recent advances about the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs via fully spectral Fourier-Chebyshev expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to rigorously solving initial value problems for semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) using fully spectral Fourier-Chebyshev expansions. By reformulating the PDE as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and leveraging Chebyshev series in time, we reduce the problem to a zero-finding task for Fourier-Chebyshev coefficients. A key theoretical contribution is the derivation of an explicit decay estimate for the inverse of the linear part of the PDE, enabling larger time steps. This allows the construction of an approximate inverse for the Fr\'echet derivative and the application of a Newton-Kantorovich theorem to establish solution existence within explicit error bounds. Building on prior work, our method is extended to more complex partial differential equations, including the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, for which we establish global existence of the solution of the IVP for a given nontrivial initial condition.</description>

      <title>Refinement of the $L^{2}$-decay estimate of solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with attractive-dissipative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the $L^{2}$-decay estimate of solutions to nonlinear dissipative Schr\"odinger equations with power-type nonlinearity of the order $p$. It is known that the sign of the real part of the dissipation coefficient affects the long-time behavior of solutions, when neither size restriction on the initial data nor strong dissipative condition is imposed. In that case, if the sign is negative, then Gerelmaa, the first and third author [7] obtained the $L^{2}$-decay estimate under the restriction $p \le 1+1/d$. In this paper, we relax the restriction to $p \le 1+4/(3d)$ by refining an energy-type estimate. Furthermore, when $p &lt; 1+ 4/(3d)$, using an iteration argument, the best available decay rate is established, as given by Hayashi, Li and Naumkin [11].</description>

      <title>A general quasilinear elliptic problem with variable exponents and Neumann boundary conditions for image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to state and prove existence and uniqueness results for a general elliptic problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, often associated with image processing tasks like denoising. The novelty is that we surpass the lack of coercivity of the Euler-Lagrange functional with an innovative technique that has at its core the idea of showing that the minimum of the energy functional over a subset of the space $W^{1,p(x)}(\Omega)$ coincides with the global minimum. The obtained existence result applies to multiple-phase elliptic problems under remarkably weak assumptions.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal problem in the space of probabilities measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the value function in the time-optimal problem for a continuity equation in the space of probability measures. We derive the dynamic programming principle for this problem. In particular, we prove that the Kruzhkov transform of the value function coincides with a unique discontinuous viscosity solution to the corresponding Dirichlet problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Finally, we establish the $\Gamma$-convergence of the value function in a perturbed problem to the value function in the unperturbed problem.</description>

      <title>Sharp Boundary Estimates and Harnack Inequalities for Fractional Porous Medium type Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides sharp quantitative and constructive estimates of nonnegative solutions $u(t,x)\geq 0$ to the nonlinear fractional diffusion equation, $$\partial_t u +{\mathcal L} F(u)=0,$$ also known as filtration equation, posed in a smooth bounded domain $x\in \Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^N$ with suitable homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Both the operator ${\mathcal L}$ and the nonlinearity $F$ belong to a general class. The assumption on ${\mathcal L}$ are set in terms of the kernel of ${\mathcal L}$ and/or ${\mathcal L}^{-1}$, and allow for operators with degenerate kernel at the boundary of $\Omega$. The main examples of ${\mathcal L}$ are the three different Dirichlet Fractional Laplacians on bounded domains, and the nonlinearity can be non-homogeneous, for instance, $F(u)=u^2+u^{10}$. Previous result were known in the porous medium case, i.e. $F(u)=|u|^{m-1} u$ with $m&gt;1$. Our aim here is to perform the next step: a delicate analysis of regularity through quantitative, constructive and sharp a priori estimates. Our main results are global Harnack type inequalities $$H_0(t,u_0)\, {\rm dist}(x, \partial \Omega)^a\leq F(u(t,x))\leq H_1(t)\, {\rm dist}(x, \partial \Omega)^b\qquad\forall (t,x)\in (0,\infty)\times \overline{\Omega},$$ where the expressions of $H_0, H_1$ and $a,b$ are explicit and may change according to ${\mathcal L}$ and $F$. The sharpness of such estimates is proven by means of examples and counterexamples: on the one hand, we can match the powers (i.e. $a=b$) when the operator has a non degenerate kernel. On the other hand, when ${\mathcal L}$ has a kernel that degenerates at the boundary $\partial\Omega$, there appear an intriguing anomalous boundary behaviour: the size of the initial data determines the sharp boundary behaviour of the solution, different for ``small'' and ``large'' initial data. We conclude the paper with higher regularity results.</description>

      <title>The spatially discrete to continuous limit in the nonlocal quantum diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a spatial discretization of the non-local Quantum Drift Diffusion (nlQDD) model by Degond, M\`{e}hats and Ringhofer in one space dimension. With our approach, that uses consistently matrices on ${\mathbb C}^N$ instead of operators on $L^2$, we circumvent a variety of analytical subtleties in the analysis of the original nlQDD equation, e.g. related to positivity of densities or to the quantum exponential function.
  Our starting point is spatially discretized quantum Boltzmann equation with a BGK-type collision kernel, from which we derive the discretized nlQDD model in the diffusive limit. Then we verify that solutions dissipate the von-Neumann entropy, which is a known key property of the original nlQDD, and prove global existence of positive solutions, which seems to be a particular feature of the discretization. Our main result concerns convergence of the scheme: discrete solutions converge -- locally uniformly with respect to space and time -- to classical solutions of the the original nlQDD model on any time interval $[0,T)$ on which the latter remain positive. In particular, this extends the existence theory for nlQDD, that has been established only for initial data close to equilibrium so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (SCGL) on compact surfaces with magnetic Laplacian and polynomial nonlinearity, forced by a space-time white noise. After renormalizing the equation in a suitable manner, we show that the dynamics is locally well-posed. Moreover, we prove deterministic global well-posedness for the defocusing SCGL in the weakly dispersive regime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining local bifurcation analysis with numerical continuation and bifurcation methods we study bifurcations from cylindrical vesicles described by the Helfrich equation with volume and area constraints, with a prescribed periodicity along the cylindrical axis. The bifurcating solutions are in two main classes, axisymmetric (pearling), and non-axisymmetric (coiling, buckling, and wrinkling), and depending on the spontaneous curvature and the prescribed periodicity along the cylinder axis we obtain different stabilities of the bifurcating branches, and different secondary bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the NLS-log equation on a tadpole graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to study some dynamics issues of the nonlinear logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation (NLS-log) on a tadpole graph, namely, a graph consisting of a circle with a half-line attached at a single vertex. By considering $\delta$-type boundary conditions at the junction we show the existence and the orbital stability of standing-waves solutions with a profile determined by a positive single-lobe state. Via a splitting eigenvalue method, we identify the Morse index and the nullity index of a specific linearized operator around an a priori positive single-lobe state. To our knowledge, the results contained in this paper are the first in studying the (NLS-log) on tadpole graphs. In particular, our approach has the prospect of being extended to study stability properties of other bound states for the (NLS-log) on a tadpole graph or another non-compact metric graph such as a looping edge graph.</description>

      <title>Stability of axial free-boundary hyperplanes in convex circular cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an axially-symmetric, $(n+1)$-dimensional convex cone $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we study the stability of the free-boundary minimal surface $\Sigma$ obtained by intersecting $\Omega$ with a $n$-plane that contains the axis of $\Omega$. In the case $n=2$, $\Sigma$ is always unstable, as a special case of the vertex-skipping property recently proved in a paper by the same authors. Conversely, as soon as $n \ge 3$ and $\Omega$ has a sufficiently large aperture (depending on the dimension $n$), we show that $\Sigma$ is strictly stable. For our stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz flow $\Sigma_{t}[f]$ of deformations of $\Sigma$ associated with a compactly-supported, scalar deformation field $f$, which satisfies the key property $\partial \Sigma_{t}[f] \subset \partial \Omega$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of $\Sigma$ along the flow, and ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting its connection with a functional inequality studied in the context of reaction-diffusion problems.</description>

      <title>Fujita-type results for the semilinear heat equations driven by mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the critical behavior of the semilinear heat equation $u_t+\mathcal{L}_{a, b}u=|u|^p+f(x)$, considering both the presence and absence of a forcing term $f(x).$ The mixed local-nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}_{a, b}=-a\Delta+b(-\Delta)^s,\,a,\,b \in \mathbb{R}_+,$ incorporates both local and nonlocal Laplacians. We determine the Fujita-type critical exponents by considering the existence or nonexistence of global solutions. Interestingly, the critical exponent is determined by the nonlocal component of the operator and, as a result, coincides with that of the fractional Laplacian.
  In the case without a forcing term, our results improve upon recent findings by Biagi et al. [Bull. London Math. Soc. 57 (2025), 265-284] and Del Pezzo et al. [Nonlinear Analysis 255 (2025), 113761]. When a forcing term is included, our results refine those of Wang et al. [J. Math. Anal. Appl., 488 (1) (2020), 124067] and complement the work of Majdoub [La Matematica, 2 (2023), 340-361].</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal approach for linear and non-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this numerical work, we deal with two distinct problems concerning the propagation of waves in cosmological backgrounds. In both cases, we employ a spacetime foliation given in terms of compactified hyperboloidal slices. These slices intersect future null infinity, so our method is well-suited to study the long-time behaviour of waves. Moreover, our construction is adapted to the presence of the time--dependent scale factor that describes the underlying spacetime expansion. First, we investigate decay rates for solutions to the linear wave equation in a large class of expanding FLRW spacetimes, whose non--compact spatial sections have either zero or negative curvature. By means of a hyperboloidal foliation, we provide new numerical evidence for the sharpness of decay--in--time estimates for linear waves propagating in such spacetimes. Then, in the spatially-flat case, we present numerical results in support of small data global existence of solutions to semi-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes having a decelerated expansion, provided that a generalized null condition holds. In absence of this null condition and in the specific case of $ \square_g \phi = (\partial_t \phi)^2 $ (Fritz John's choice), the results we obtain suggest that, when the spacetime expansion is sufficiently slow, solutions diverge in finite time for every choice of initial data.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation for the Critical Value of Eikonal Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical value of an eikonal equation is the unique value of a parameter for which the equation admits solutions and is deeply related to the effective Hamiltonian of a corresponding homogenization problem. We study approximation strategies for the critical value of eikonal equations posed on networks. They are based on the large time behavior of corresponding time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We provide error estimates and some numerical tests, showing the performance and the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sub-elliptic diffusions on compact groups via Dirichlet form perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an extension of parts of the classical finite dimensional sub-elliptic theory in the context of infinite dimensional compact connected metrizable groups. Given a well understood and well behaved bi-invariant Laplacian, $\Delta$, and a sub-Laplacian, $L$, to which intrinsic distances, $d_\Delta$, $d_L$, are naturally attached, we show that a comparison inequality of the form $d_L\le C(d_\Delta)^c$ (for some $0&lt;c\le 1$) implies that the Dirichlet form of a fractional power of $\Delta$ is dominated by the Dirichlet form associated with $L$. We use this result to show that, under additional assumptions, certain good properties of the heat kernel for $\Delta$ are then passed to the heat kernel associated with $L$. Explicit examples on the infinite product of copies of $SU(2)$ are discussed to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>On absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein space over R and their representation by an optimal Markov process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ = ($\mu$t)t$\in$R be a 1-parameter family of probability measures on R. In [11] we introduced its ``Markov-quantile''process: a process X= (Xt)t$\in$R that resembles as much as possible the quantile process attached to $\mu$, among the Markov processesattached to $\mu$, i.e. whose family of marginal laws is $\mu$.In this article we look at the case where $\mu$ is absolutely continuous in the Wasserstein space P2(R). Then X is solution of adynamical transport problem with marginals ($\mu$t)t. It provides a Markov minimal Lagrangian probabilistic representative of $\mu$, whichis moreover unique among the processes obtained as certain types of limits: limits for the finite dimensional topology of quantileprocesses where the past is made independent of the future conditionally on the present at finitely many times, or limits of processeslinearly interpolating $\mu$.This raises new questions about ways to obtain Markov Lagrangian representatives, and to seek uniqueness properties in thisframework.</description>

      <title>On regularity for nonhomogeneous parabolic systems with a skew-symmetric part in BMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the improved Caccioppoli inequality and the reverse H\"{o}lder inequality for gradients of weak solutions to nonhomogeneous parabolic systems whose coefficients can be split into a complex-valued and bounded part, which also satisfies the uniform G$\mathring{a}$rding inequality, and a real and anti-symmetric part in BMO. In particular, unbounded coefficients are allowed.</description>

      <title>Some qualitative and quantitative properties of weak solutions to mixed anisotropic and nonlocal quasilinear elliptic and doubly nonlinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is divided into two parts. In the first part, we examine the Brezis-Oswald problem involving a mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace operator. We establish results on existence, uniqueness, boundedness, and the strong maximum principle. Additionally, for certain mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace equations, we prove a Sturmian comparison theorem, establish comparison and nonexistence results, derive a weighted Hardy-type inequality, and analyze a system of singular mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace equations. A key component of our approach is the use of the Picone identity, which we adapt from the local and nonlocal cases. In the second part of the article, we focus on regularity estimates. In the elliptic setting, we establish a weak Harnack inequality and semicontinuity results. We also consider a class of doubly nonlinear mixed anisotropic and nonlocal parabolic equations, proving semicontinuity results and analyzing the pointwise behavior of solutions. These results rely on appropriate energy estimates, De Giorgi-type lemmas, and positivity expansions. Finally, we derive various energy estimates, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of stationary solutions of Partial Differential Equations via infinite dimensional sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of counting solutions of stationary nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) when the PDE is known to admit more than one solution. We suggest tackling the problem via a sampling-based approach. We test our proposed methodology on the McKean-Vlasov PDE, more precisely on the problem of determining the number of stationary solutions of the McKean-Vlasov (or porous medium) equation.</description>

      <title>An efficient volume-preserving MBO scheme for data clustering and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel efficient algorithm for clustering and classification tasks based on the famous MBO scheme. On the one hand, inspired by Jacobs et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 2018], we introduce constraints on the size of clusters leading to a linear integer problem. We prove that the solution to this problem is induced by a novel order statistic. This viewpoint allows us to develop exact and highly efficient algorithms to solve such constrained integer problems. On the other hand, we prove an estimate of the computational complexity of our scheme, which is better than any available provable bounds for the state of the art. This rigorous analysis is based on a variational viewpoint that connects this scheme to volume-preserving mean curvature flow in the big data and small time-step limit.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Rational Solutions to the Half-Wave Maps Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the rational solutions of the Half-Wave Maps equation (HWM) in the non-singular spectrum case. We first provide characterizations to what we call \emph{scattering behavior}, and show that they imply scattering in Sobolev norm. We then provide a local condition implying \emph{scattering behavior}. Building on this, we show that any solution with non-singular spectrum scatters and give an explicit formula for the function to which the solution is scattering. This allows us to show that the scattering map is the identity. Additionally, we create, for any given number of spins and any target non-singular spectrum, global solutions of (HWM) with a spectrum arbitrarily close to the target. Finally, using a diagonal characterization of traveling waves, we show that if a wave scatters to a traveling wave, it is a scattering wave.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric type II blowup solutions to the three dimensional Keller-Segel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct axisymmetric solutions to the three-dimensional parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system that blows up in finite time. In particular, the singularity is of type II, which admits locally a leading order profile of the rescaled stationary solution of the two-dimensional system. Additionally, mass concentration occurs along a one-dimensional ring in the plane. In the analysis, we rely on an approximate solution of the eigenproblem associated with the linearized operator around the stationary solution as well as the modulation dynamics to control the perturbation function and derive the accurate blowup rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of a unique global smooth solution to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and provide a concise proof. We establish a new global well-posedness result that allows the initial data to be arbitrarily large within the critical space $\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$, while still satisfying the nonlinear smallness condition.</description>

      <title>Non-persistence of strongly isolated singularities, and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a generic regularity result for stationary integral $n$-varifolds with only strongly isolated singularities inside $N$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, in absence of any restriction on the dimension ($n\geq 2$) and codimension. As a special case, we prove that for any $n\geq 2$ and any compact $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold $M$ the following holds: for a generic choice of the background metric $g$ all stationary integral $n$-varifolds in $(M,g)$ will either be entirely smooth or have at least one singular point that is not strongly isolated. In other words, only ``more complicated'' singularities may possibly persist. This implies, for instance, a generic finiteness result for the class of all closed minimal hypersurfaces of area at most $4\pi^2-\varepsilon$ (for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$) in nearly round four-spheres: we can thus give precise answers, in the negative, to the questions of persistence of the Clifford football and of Hsiang's hyperspheres in nearly round metrics. The aforementioned main regularity result is achieved as a consequence of the fine analysis of the Fredholm index of the Jacobi operator for such varifolds: we prove on the one hand an exact formula relating that number to the Morse indices of the conical links at the singular points, while on the other hand we show that the same number is non-negative for all such varifolds if the ambient metric is generic.</description>
