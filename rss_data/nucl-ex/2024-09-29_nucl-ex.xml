      <title>Remeasurement of the $^{239}$Pu(n,f)/$^{235}$U(n,f) Cross-Section Ratio with the NIFFTE fission Time Projection Chamber Using Vapor-deposited Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NIFFTE fission Time Projection Chamber (fissionTPC) has been used to measure the $^{239}$Pu(n,f)/$^{235}$U(n,f) cross-section ratio for neutron-induced fission in the range of 0.1 - 100 MeV, with high precision. A white neutron source was provided by the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, where the experiment was conducted as a remeasurement to evaluate a roughly 2% discrepancy of the previous fissionTPC results with ENDF/B-VIII.0. A detailed accounting of measurement uncertainties was performed, based on the fissionTPC's novel ability to provide three-dimensional reconstruction of fission-fragment ionization profiles. Current results obtained using a vapor-deposited, highly uniform $^{239}$Pu target, in comparison to the measurement published in 2021, where a $^{239}$Pu electroplated target was used, are presented and discussed. The remeasurement presented here is in agreement with the previous fissionTPC result within measurement uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all -- Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Near- and Sub-Threshold $J/\psi$ Photoproduction off Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first measurement of $J/\psi$ photoproduction from nuclei in the photon energy range of $7$ to $10.8$ GeV, extending above and below the photoproduction threshold in the free proton of $\sim8.2$ GeV. The experiment used a tagged photon beam incident on deuterium, helium, and carbon, and the GlueX detector at Jefferson Lab to measure the semi-inclusive $A(\gamma,e^+e^-p)$ reaction with a dilepton invariant mass $M(e^+e^-)\sim m_{J/\psi}=3.1$ GeV. The incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction cross sections in the measured nuclei are extracted as a function of the incident photon energy, momentum transfer, and proton reconstructed missing light-cone momentum fraction. Comparisons with theoretical predictions suggest an excess of the measured cross section for sub-threshold production and for interactions with high missing light-cone momentum fraction protons. The measured enhancement can be explained by modified gluon structure for high-virtuality bound-protons.</description>

      <title>Charged-particle production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV and Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.36 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the measurement of charged-particle pseudorapidity ($\eta$) density, $\mathrm{d}N_{\rm ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta$, in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV, and in lead$-$lead (Pb$-$Pb) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.36 TeV. The analysis is performed using the Run 3 data recorded during 2022 and 2023 by the upgraded ALICE detector. The charged-particle multiplicity is measured at midrapidity ($|\eta|&lt;1$) using the new monolithic active pixel sensors-based Inner Tracking System and the Time Projection Chamber upgraded with Gas Electron Multiplier-based readout system. The measurements in pp collisions are reported for inelastic events with at least one charged particle having $|\eta|&lt;1$ whereas for Pb$-$Pb collisions, the $\mathrm{d}N_{\rm ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta$ is obtained for different centrality classes, ranging from 0$-$5\% (most central) to 70$-$80\% (most peripheral). The energy dependence of average charged-particle pseudorapidity density ($\langle \mathrm{d}N_{\rm ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta \rangle$) measured in $|\eta|&lt;0.5$ is studied and compared to earlier measurements at lower collision energies. In Pb$-$Pb collisions, the evolution of $\langle \mathrm{d}N_{\rm ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta \rangle$ as a function of the average number of participating nucleons, $\langle N_{\mathrm{part}} \rangle$, determined with a Glauber model, is also studied and compared with predictions from theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Clocking the particle production and tracking of strangeness balance and radial flow effects at top LHC energy with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balance functions have been used extensively to elucidate the time evolution of quark production in heavy-ion collisions. Early models predicted two stages of quark production, one for light quarks and one for the heavier strange quark, separated by a period of isentropic expansion. This led to the notion of clocking particle production and tracking radial flow effects, which drive the expansion of the system. In this talk, balance functions of identified particles in different multiplicity classes of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6\;\text{TeV}$ recorded by ALICE during the LHC Run 3 are reported. The results are compared with different models as well as with previously published results on pp and Pb--Pb collisions at different energies. The results enable tracking the balancing of electric charge and strangeness by measuring how the widths and integrals of the charge and strangeness balance functions evolve across different collision energies.</description>

      <title>Improved modeling of $\gamma\gamma$ processes in ultraperipheral collisions at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CERN LHC is not only the current energy-frontier collider for parton-parton collisions, but has proven a powerful photon collider providing photon-photon ($\gamma\gamma$) collisions at center-of-mass energies and luminosities never reached before. The latest theoretical developments implemented in the gamma-UPC Monte Carlo (MC) event generator, which can calculate arbitrary exclusive final state produced via $\gamma\gamma$ fusion in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of protons and/or nuclei at the LHC, are presented. These include azimuthal modulations of dilepton pairs produced in the $\gamma\gamma\to\ell^+\ell^-$ process, and neutron emission probabilities for photoexcited lead ions in PbPb UPCs. A few comparisons of the results of the updated gamma-UPC v.1.6 code to relevant RHIC and LHC data are presented.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect with charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.44$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-dependent two- and three-particle correlations measured in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.44$ TeV are presented. Results are obtained for charged particles in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|&lt;0.8$ and transverse momentum interval $0.2 \le p_{\rm T}&lt;5.0$ GeV/$c$ for different collision centralities. The three-particle correlator ${\gamma_{\alpha\beta}} \equiv {\langle \cos(\varphi_\alpha + \varphi_\beta - 2{\Psi_{\rm 2}}) \rangle}$, calculated for different combinations of charge sign $\alpha$ and $\beta$, is expected to be sensitive to the presence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). Its magnitude is similar to the one observed in Pb-Pb collisions in contrast to a smaller CME signal in Xe-Xe collisions than in Pb-Pb collisions predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) calculations including a magnetic field induced by the spectator protons. These observations point to a large non-CME contribution to the correlator. Furthermore, the charge dependence of ${\gamma_{\alpha\beta}}$ can be described by a blast wave model calculation that incorporates background effects and by the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics model with values of the CME signal consistent with zero. The Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb results are combined with the expected CME signal dependence on the system size from the MC calculations including a magnetic field to obtain the fraction of CME contribution in ${\gamma_{\alpha\beta}}$, $f_{\rm CME}$. The CME fraction is compatible with zero for the 30% most central events in both systems and then becomes positive. This yields an upper limit of 2% (3%) and 25% (32%) at 95% (99.7%) confidence level for the CME signal contribution to ${\gamma_{\alpha\beta}}$ in the 0-70% Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions, respectively.</description>

      <title>The ALICE experiment: a journey through QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ALICE experiment was proposed in 1993, to study strongly-interacting matter at extreme energy densities and temperatures. This proposal entailed a comprehensive investigation of nuclear collisions at the LHC. Its physics programme initially focused on the determination of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, created in such collisions. The ALICE physics programme has been extended to cover a broader ensemble of observables related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. The experiment has studied Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, p-Pb and pp collisions in the multi-TeV centre of mass energy range, during the Run 1-2 data-taking periods at the LHC (2009-2018). The aim of this review is to summarise the key ALICE physics results in this endeavor, and to discuss their implications on the current understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of strongly-interacting matter at the highest temperatures reached in the laboratory. It will review the latest findings on the properties of the QGP created by heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies, and describe the surprising QGP-like effects in pp and p-Pb collisions. Measurements of few-body QCD interactions, and their impact in unraveling the structure of hadrons and hadronic interactions, will be discussed. ALICE results relevant for physics topics outside the realm of QCD will also be touched upon. Finally, prospects for future measurements with the ALICE detector in the context of its planned upgrades will also be briefly described.</description>

      <title>Measurements of jet quenching using semi-inclusive hadron+jet distributions in pp and central Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration reports measurements of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse momentum (high $p_{\rm T}$) charged hadron, in pp and central Pb$-$Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon$-$nucleon collision $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. The large uncorrelated background in central Pb$-$Pb collisions is corrected using a data-driven statistical approach, which enables precise measurement of recoil jet distributions over a broad range in $p_{\rm T,ch\,jet}$ and jet resolution parameter $R$. Recoil jet yields are reported for $R=0.2$, 0.4, and 0.5 in the range $7 &lt; p_{\rm T,ch\, jet} &lt; 140$ GeV$/c$ and $\pi/2&lt;\Delta\varphi&lt;\pi$, where $\Delta\varphi$ is the azimuthal angular separation between hadron trigger and recoil jet. The low $p_{\rm T,ch\,jet}$ reach of the measurement explores unique phase space for studying jet quenching, the interaction of jets with the quark-gluonnplasma generated in high-energy nuclear collisions. Comparison of $p_{\rm T,ch\,jet}$ distributions from pp and central Pb$-$Pb collisions probes medium-induced jet energy loss and intra-jet broadening, while comparison of their acoplanarity distributions explores in-medium jet scattering and medium response. The measurements are compared to theoretical calculations incorporating jet quenching.</description>

Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration reports the measurement of semi-inclusive distributions of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse momentum (high $p_{\rm T}$) hadron trigger in proton$-$proton and central Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. A data-driven statistical method is used to mitigate the large uncorrelated background in central Pb$-$Pb collisions. Recoil jet distributions are reported for jet resolution parameter $R=0.2$, 0.4, and 0.5 in the range $7 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 140$ GeV$/c$ and trigger$-$recoil jet azimuthal separation $\pi/2 &lt; \Delta\varphi &lt; \pi$. The measurements exhibit a marked medium-induced jet yield enhancement at low $p_{\rm T}$ and at large azimuthal deviation from $\Delta\varphi\sim\pi$. The enhancement is characterized by its dependence on $\Delta\varphi$, which has a slope that differs from zero by 4.7$\sigma$. Comparisons to model calculations incorporating different formulations of jet quenching are reported. These comparisons indicate that the observed yield enhancement arises from the response of the QGP medium to jet propagation.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow vector fluctuations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02~\mathrm{TeV}$ using azimuthal correlations with the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider are presented. A four-particle correlation approach [1] is used to quantify the effects of flow angle and magnitude fluctuations separately. This paper extends previous studies to additional centrality intervals and provides measurements of the $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow vector fluctuations at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02~\mathrm{TeV}$ with two-particle correlations. Significant $p_{\rm T}$-dependent fluctuations of the $\vec{V}_{2}$ flow vector in Pb-Pb collisions are found across different centrality ranges, with the largest fluctuations of up to $\sim$15% being present in the 5% most central collisions. In parallel, no evidence of significant $p_{\rm T}$-dependent fluctuations of $\vec{V}_{3}$ or $\vec{V}_{4}$ is found. Additionally, evidence of flow angle and magnitude fluctuations is observed with more than $5\sigma$ significance in central collisions. These observations in Pb-Pb collisions indicate where the classical picture of hydrodynamic modeling with a common symmetry plane breaks down. This has implications for hard probes at high $p_{\rm T}$, which might be biased by $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow angle fluctuations of at least 23% in central collisions. Given the presented results, existing theoretical models should be re-examined to improve our understanding of initial conditions, quark--gluon plasma properties, and the dynamic evolution of the created system.</description>

Abstract: The angular correlations between charged $\Xi$ baryons and associated identified hadrons (pions, kaons, protons, $\Lambda$ baryons, and $\Xi$ baryons) are measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ALICE detector to give insight into the particle production mechanisms and balancing of quantum numbers on the microscopic level. In particular, the distribution of strangeness is investigated in the correlations between the doubly-strange $\Xi$ baryon and mesons and baryons that contain a single strange quark, K and $\Lambda$. As a reference, the results are compared to $\Xi\pi$ and $\Xi\mathrm{p}$ correlations, where the associated mesons and baryons do not contain a strange valence quark. These measurements are expected to be sensitive to whether strangeness is produced through string breaking or in a thermal production scenario. Furthermore, the multiplicity dependence of the correlation functions is measured to look for the turn-on of additional particle production mechanisms with event activity. The results are compared to predictions from the string-breaking model PYTHIA 8, including tunes with baryon junctions and rope hadronisation enabled, the cluster hadronisation model HERWIG 7, and the core-corona model EPOS-LHC. While some aspects of the experimental data are described quantitatively or qualitatively by the Monte Carlo models, no model can match all features of the data. These results provide stringent constraints on the strangeness and baryon number production mechanisms in pp collisions.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>

Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
