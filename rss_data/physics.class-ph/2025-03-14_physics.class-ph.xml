      <title>Analysis of linear Boussinesq-type models coupled with static interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new approach to analyze the coupling of linear Boussinesq and Saint-Venant shallow water wave equations in the case where the interface remains at a constant position in space. We propose a one-way coupling model as a reference, which allows us to obtain an analytical solution, prove the well-posedness of the original coupled model and compute what we call the coupling error-a quantity that depends solely on the choice of transmission conditions at the interface. We prove that this coupling error is asymptotically small for a certain class of data and discuss its role as a proxy for the full error with respect to the 3D water wave problem. Additionally, we highlight that this error can be easily computed in other scenarios. We show that the coupling error consists of reflected waves and argue that this explains some previously unexplained spurious oscillations reported in the literature. Finally, we prove the well-posedness of the half-line linear Boussinesq problem.</description>

      <title>The swinging counterweight trebuchet. Experiments on inner movement and ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inner movement of a trebuchet with swinging counterweight was measured inside a laboratory by the use of rotation sensors to determine angular coordinates for beam, counterweight and sling. Data collection was started before the trebuchet was fired and lasted until some time after the projectile was released and flung into ground right in front of the machine. A single measurement is then sufficient for a semi-empirical determination of longest range and kinetic energy at target as well as mechanical energies and internal forces throughout the entire shot. Loss of mechanical energy was ascertained and attributed to friction. Measurements of actual ranges performed on a flat field with little wind are presented and compared with the semi-empirical determinations and ab initio calculations.</description>
