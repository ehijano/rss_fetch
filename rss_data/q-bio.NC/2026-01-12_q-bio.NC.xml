      <title>Evolving Cognitive Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.</description>

      <title>Irreversible behavior drives neural flows in the hippocampus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the brain, neural activity undergoes directed flows between states, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry. At the same time, animals also exhibit irreversible flows between behavioral states. Yet it remains unclear whether -- and how -- irreversibility in the brain relates to irreversibility in behavior. Here, we explore this connection in the hippocampus, where neural activity encodes physical location. We show that hippocampal irreversibility can be quantified using the time-delayed cross-correlations between neurons. As a mouse moves along a virtual track, we find that physical flows through the animal's environment generate neural flows through its cognitive map. Strikingly, this neural irreversibility is explained by a minimal model with only three parameters: the average velocity of the mouse, the variance in this velocity, and the resolution of the neural encoding. Together, these results provide a mechanistic understanding of irreversibility in the hippocampus and shed light on the links between symmetry breaking in the brain and behavior.</description>

      <title>An outlook on extracellular waveforms produced by the three neuronal compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is composed of billions of neurons with virtually endless morphologies and ion channel compositions, resulting in unique extracellular waveforms. Nevertheless, almost all neuronal morphologies can be reduced to a simple architecture made of three principal compartments: 1) the soma and nearby axonal hillock, 2) axonal projections ending in arbors or single synaptic contacts, and 3) dendrites. This review offers a perspective on how these three ubiquitous neuronal compartments can be identified and how they shape the extracellularly recorded waveforms, when spatial considerations are taken into account. This outlook utilizes biophysical modelling to complement existing experimental observations. Modeling has predicted a rich landscape of putative extracellular waveforms based on morphology, channel density, and sequential temporal activation. Recent advances in extracellular in vivo recording, combining low noise with high spatial density of recording sites, have improved the precision of extracellular waveform measurements, particularly in capturing waveforms beyond the classical somatic spikes, and in some cases, combinations originating from different compartments. This review aims to reorganize extracellular waveform heterogeneity by separating signals stemming from three neuronal compartments using three dimensions: amplitude, duration, and spatial extent or footprint. In doing so, we argue for a change of perspective, looking beyond somatic spikes to include spatiality and waveform combinations.</description>

      <title>gPC-based robustness analysis of neural systems through probabilistic recurrence metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal systems often preserve their characteristic functions and signalling patterns, also referred to as regimes, despite parametric uncertainties and variations. For neural models having uncertain parameters with a known probability distribution, probabilistic robustness analysis (PRA) allows us to understand and quantify under which uncertainty conditions a regime is preserved in expectation. We introduce a new computational framework for the efficient and systematic PRA of dynamical systems in neuroscience and we show its efficacy in analysing well-known neural models that exhibit multiple dynamical regimes: the Hindmarsh-Rose model for single neurons and the Jansen-Rit model for cortical columns. Given a model subject to parametric uncertainty, we employ generalised polynomial chaos to derive mean neural activity signals, which are then used to assess the amount of parametric uncertainty that the system can withstand while preserving the current regime, thereby quantifying the regime's robustness to such uncertainty. To assess persistence of regimes, we propose new metrics, which we apply to recurrence plots obtained from the mean neural activity signals. The overall result is a novel, general computational methodology that combines recurrence plot analysis and systematic persistence analysis to assess how much the uncertain model parameters can vary, with respect to their nominal value, while preserving the nominal regimes in expectation. We summarise the PRA results through probabilistic regime preservation (PRP) plots, which capture the effect of parametric uncertainties on the robustness of dynamical regimes in the considered models.</description>
