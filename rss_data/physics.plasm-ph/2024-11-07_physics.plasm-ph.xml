      <title>Collisional charging of dust particles by suprathermal particles. I -- Standard anisotropic Kappa distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the velocity distributions of the plasma particles on the equilibrium charge of dust particles which suffer collisional charging, considering different forms of both isotropic and anisotropic Kappa distributions for ions and electrons. This paper is the first of a series of two papers on this subject. Here, we consider two different forms of Kappa distributions which are widely used in the literature, and show that effects on the dust charge associated to one of these forms are much more significant than the effects associated to the other basic form. The results obtained also show that changes in the electron distribution can have effect on the dust charge which is much more significant than the effect which can be associated to changes in the ion distribution.</description>

      <title>Fluid Models from Kinetic Models using a Geometric Averaging Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2767</link>
      <description>arXiv:0912.2767v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We interpret the Lorentz force equation as a geodesic equation associated with a non-linear connection. Using a geometric averaging procedure, we prove that for narrow and smooth one-particle distribution functions whose supports are invariant under the flow of the Lorentz equation, a bunch of charged point particles can be described by a charged cold fluid model in the ultra-relativistic regime. The method used to prove this result does not require additional hypotheses on the higher moments of the distribution. This is accomplished by estimating the expressions that include the differential operators appearing in the charged cold fluid model equation. Under the specified conditions of narrowness and ultra-relativistic dynamics, it turns out that these differential expressions are close to zero, justifying the use of the charged cold fluid model. The method presented in the work can also be applied to justify the use of warm plasmas and other models.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Design of Compact, Permanent-Magnet Transport Systems for Highly Divergent, Broad Energy Spread Laser-Driven Proton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven (LD) ion acceleration has been explored in a newly constructed short focal length beamline at the BELLA petawatt facility (interaction point 2, iP2). For applications utilizing such LD ion beams, a beam transport system is required, which for reasons of compactness be ideally contained within 3 m. While they are generated from a micron-scale source, large divergence and energy spread of LD ion beams present a unique challenge to transporting them compared to beams from conventional accelerators. This study gives an overview of proposed compact transport designs using permanent magnets satisfying different requirements depending on the application for the iP2 proton beamline such as radiation biology, material science, and high energy density science. These designs are optimized for different parameters such as energy spread and peak proton density according to the application's need. The various designs consist solely of permanent magnet elements, which can provide high magnetic field gradients on a small footprint. While the field strengths are fixed, we have shown that the beam size is able to be tuned effectively by varying the placement of the magnets. The performance of each design was evaluated based on high order particle tracking simulations of typical LD proton beams. We also examine the ability of certain configurations to tune and select beam energies, critical for specific applications. A more detailed investigation was carried out for a design to deliver 10 MeV LD accelerated ions for radiation biology applications. With these transport system designs, the iP2 beamline is ready to house various application experiments.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic energy of solid binary ionic mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electrostatic energy of binary ionic mixtures (BIMs) in the form of Coulomb crystals with the main focus on ordered crystals. We consider 15 different binary bcc-like lattices, accurately calculate their electrostatic energies and approximate them by a unified equation. These results extend those available in the literature. A detailed comparison with selected previous results is made, particularly, using previous calculations in the linear mixing rule approximation. The case of disordered BIMs is also outlined. The results are expected to be useful for exploring multi-component Coulomb systems in compact stars, laboratory plasmas, and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Super-Resolution: Discovering hidden physics and its application to fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-linear system governed by multi-spatial and multi-temporal physics scales cannot be fully understood with a single diagnostic, as each provides only a partial view, leading to information loss. Combining multiple diagnostics may also result in incomplete projections of the system's physics. By identifying hidden inter-correlations between diagnostics, we can leverage mutual support to fill in these gaps, but uncovering such correlations analytically is too complex. We introduce a machine learning methodology to address this issue. Unlike traditional methods, our multimodal approach does not rely on the target diagnostic's direct measurements to generate its super-resolution version. Instead, it uses other diagnostics to produce super-resolution data, capturing detailed structural evolution and responses to perturbations previously unobservable. This not only enhances the resolution of a diagnostic for deeper insights but also reconstructs the target diagnostic, providing a valuable tool to mitigate diagnostic failure. This methodology addresses a key challenge in fusion plasmas: the Edge Localized Mode (ELM), a plasma instability that can cause significant erosion of plasma-facing materials. A method to stabilize ELM is using resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) to trigger magnetic islands. However, limited spatial and temporal resolution restricts analysis of these islands due to their small size, rapid dynamics, and complex plasma interactions. With super-resolution diagnostics, we can experimentally verify theoretical models of magnetic islands for the first time, providing insights into their role in ELM stabilization. This advancement supports the development of effective ELM suppression strategies for future fusion reactors like ITER and has broader applications, potentially revolutionizing diagnostics in fields such as astronomy, astrophysics, and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Kinetic Effects on Current Gradient-Driven Instabilities of Electron Current Layers via Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron current layers, which form in various natural and laboratory plasmas, are susceptible to multiple instabilities, with tearing being a prominent instability driven by current gradients. Tearing is considered a potential mechanism for magnetic reconnection in collisionless regimes, where electron inertia acts as a non-ideal factor that causes magnetic field lines to break and reconnect. In contrast, another mode, known as the surface-preserving mode, also driven by current gradients, maintains the magnetic field topology. In this study, we investigate the kinetic effects on these modes in the presence of finite electron temperatures using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Our findings reveal that temperature significantly stabilizes the tearing mode, particularly at higher temperatures, due to an increased electron Larmor radius and the associated magnetic field diffusion. We also examine the interplay between the guide field and temperature. Additionally, we observe that growth rates for the surface-preserving mode, in contrast to the tearing mode, increase with temperature, likely due to enhanced electron flow velocities. Furthermore, we identify cases with mixed modes, where both tearing and surface-preserving modes coexist, exhibiting asymmetric structures characteristic of asymmetric magnetic reconnection. Finally, we outline potential future research directions that build upon our findings.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning to Design High Aspect Ratio Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of fusion devices is typically based on computationally expensive simulations. This can be alleviated using high aspect ratio models that employ a reduced number of free parameters, especially in the case of stellarator optimization where non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with a large parameter space are optimized to satisfy certain performance criteria. However, optimization is still required to find configurations with properties such as low elongation, high rotational transform, finite plasma beta, and good fast particle confinement. In this work, we train a machine learning model to construct configurations with favorable confinement properties by finding a solution to the inverse design problem, that is, obtaining a set of model input parameters for given desired properties. Since the solution of the inverse problem is non-unique, a probabilistic approach, based on mixture density networks, is used. It is shown that optimized configurations can be generated reliably using this method.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first toward and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

      <title>Slope of Magnetic Field-Density Relation as An Indicator of Magnetic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star-formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic field is best summarized by the Cruther+ 2010 B-rho relation. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in the collapse, or the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, ${\cal M}_{\rm A}$-k$_{B-\rho}$(slope of $B-\rho$ relation) relation. This fundamental B-$\rho$-slope relation enables one to measure the Alfv\'enic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B-$\rho$ plane. It allows us to drive the following empirical $B-\rho$ relation \begin{equation}
  \frac{B}{B_c} = {\rm exp}\left(\left(\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)\nonumber, \end{equation} which offers an excellent fit to the Cruther et al. data, where we assume ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-\rho$ relation. The foundational ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-{\rm k}_{B-\rho}$ relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of Cruther+2010, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.</description>
