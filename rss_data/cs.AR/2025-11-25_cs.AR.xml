      <title>Optimized Memory Tagging on AmpereOne Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory-safety escapes continue to form the launching pad for a wide range of security attacks, especially for the substantial base of deployed software that is coded in pointer-based languages such as C/C++. Although compiler and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions have been introduced to address elements of this issue, the overhead and/or comprehensive applicability have limited broad production deployment. The Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to the ARM AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture is a valuable tool to address memory-safety escapes; when used in synchronous tag-checking mode, MTE provides deterministic detection and prevention of sequential buffer overflow attacks, and probabilistic detection and prevention of exploits resulting from temporal use-after-free pointer programming bugs. The AmpereOne processor, launched in 2024, is the first datacenter processor to support MTE. Its optimized MTE implementation uniquely incurs no memory capacity overhead for tag storage and provides synchronous tag-checking with single-digit performance impact across a broad range of datacenter class workloads. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the complete hardware-software stack, identifying application memory management as the primary remaining source of overhead and highlighting clear opportunities for software optimization. The combination of an efficient hardware foundation and a clear path for software improvement makes the MTE implementation of the AmpereOne processor highly attractive for deployment in production cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Design Space Exploration for Tensorized Neural Network Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4 and 3.85 lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.</description>

      <title>HDDB: Efficient In-Storage SQL Database Search Using Hyperdimensional Computing on Ferroelectric NAND Flash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) encodes information and data into high-dimensional distributed vectors that can be manipulated using simple bitwise operations and similarity searches, offering parallelism, low-precision hardware friendliness, and strong robustness to noise. These properties are a natural fit for SQL database workloads dominated by predicate evaluation and scans, which demand low energy and low latency over large fact tables. Notably, HDC's noise-tolerance maps well onto emerging ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) memories, which provide ultra-high density and in-storage compute capability but suffer from elevated raw bit-error rates. In this work, we propose HDDB, a hardware-software co-design that combines HDC with FeNAND multi-level cells (MLC) to perform in-storage SQL predicate evaluation and analytics with massive parallelism and minimal data movement. Particularly, we introduce novel HDC encoding techniques for standard SQL data tables and formulate predicate-based filtering and aggregation as highly efficient HDC operations that can happen in-storage. By exploiting the intrinsic redundancy of HDC, HDDB maintains correct predicate and decode outcomes under substantial device noise (up to 10% randomly corrupted TLC cells) without explicit error-correction overheads. Experiments on TPC-DS fact tables show that HDDB achieves up to 80.6x lower latency and 12,636x lower energy consumption compared to conventional CPU/GPU SQL database engines, suggesting that HDDB provides a practical substrate for noise-robust, memory-centric database processing.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of NVENC Split-Frame Encoding (SFE) for UHD Video Transcoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) features in modern NVIDIA GPUs, offer significant advantages over software encoders by providing comparable Rate-Distortion (RD) performance while consuming considerably less power. The increasing capability of consumer devices to capture footage in Ultra High-Definition (UHD) at 4K and 8K resolutions necessitates high-performance video transcoders for internet-based delivery. To address this demand, NVIDIA introduced Split-Frame Encoding (SFE), a technique that leverages multiple on-die NVENC chips available in high-end GPUs. SFE splits a single UHD frame for parallel encoding across these physical encoders and subsequently stitches the results, which significantly improves encoding throughput. However, this approach is known to incur an RD performance penalty. The widespread adoption of NVIDIA GPUs in data centers, driven by the rise of Generative AI, means NVENC is poised to play a critical role in transcoding UHD video. To better understand the performance-efficiency tradeoff of SFE, this paper evaluates SFE's impact on RD performance, encoding throughput, power consumption, and end-to-end latency using standardized test sequences. The results show that for real-time applications, SFE nearly doubles encoding throughput with a negligible RD performance penalty, which enables the use of higher-quality presets for 4K and makes real-time 8K encoding feasible, effectively offsetting the minor RD penalty. Moreover, SFE adds no latency at 4K and can reduce it at 8K, positioning it as a key enabler for high-throughput, real-time UHD transcoding.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of GPU Video Encoder for Low-Latency Real-Time 4K UHD Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-quality, real-time video streaming has grown exponentially, with 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) becoming the new standard for many applications such as live broadcasting, TV services, and interactive cloud gaming. This trend has driven the integration of dedicated hardware encoders into modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Nowadays, these encoders support advanced codecs like HEVC and AV1 and feature specialized Low-Latency and Ultra Low-Latency tuning, targeting end-to-end latencies of &lt; 2 seconds and &lt; 500 ms, respectively. As the demand for such capabilities grows toward the 6G era, a clear understanding of their performance implications is essential. In this work, we evaluate the low-latency encoding modes on GPUs from NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD from both Rate-Distortion (RD) performance and latency perspectives. The results are then compared against both the normal-latency tuning of hardware encoders and leading software encoders. Results show hardware encoders achieve significantly lower E2E latency than software solutions with slightly better RD performance. While standard Low-Latency tuning yields a poor quality-latency trade-off, the Ultra Low-Latency mode reduces E2E latency to 83 ms (5 frames) without additional RD impact. Furthermore, hardware encoder latency is largely insensitive to quality presets, enabling high-quality, low-latency streams without compromise.</description>

      <title>Splatonic: Architecture Support for 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM via Sparse Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising direction for SLAM due to its high-fidelity reconstruction and rapid convergence. However, 3DGS-SLAM algorithms remain impractical for mobile platforms due to their high computational cost, especially for their tracking process.
  This work introduces Splatonic, a sparse and efficient real-time 3DGS-SLAM algorithm-hardware co-design for resource-constrained devices. Inspired by classical SLAMs, we propose an adaptive sparse pixel sampling algorithm that reduces the number of rendered pixels by up to 256$\times$ while retaining accuracy. To unlock this performance potential on mobile GPUs, we design a novel pixel-based rendering pipeline that improves hardware utilization via Gaussian-parallel rendering and preemptive $\alpha$-checking. Together, these optimizations yield up to 121.7$\times$ speedup on the bottleneck stages and 14.6$\times$ end-to-end speedup on off-the-shelf GPUs. To further address new bottlenecks introduced by our rendering pipeline, we propose a pipelined architecture that simplifies the overall design while addressing newly emerged bottlenecks in projection and aggregation. Evaluated across four 3DGS-SLAM algorithms, Splatonic achieves up to 274.9$\times$ speedup and 4738.5$\times$ energy savings over mobile GPUs and up to 25.2$\times$ speedup and 241.1$\times$ energy savings over state-of-the-art accelerators, all with comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>HeLEx: A Heterogeneous Layout Explorer for Spatial Elastic Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HeLEx, a framework for determining the functional layout of heterogeneous spatially-configured elastic Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs). Given a collection of input data flow graphs (DFGs) and a target CGRA, the framework starts with a full layout in which every processing element (PE) supports every operation in the DFGs. It then employs a branch-and-bound (BB) search to eliminate operations out of PEs, ensuring that the input DFGs successfully map onto the resulting CGRAs, eventually returning an optimized heterogeneous CGRA. Experimental evaluation with 12 DFGs and 9 target CGRA sizes reveals that the framework reduces the number of operations by 68.7% on average, resulting in a reduction of CGRA area by almost 70% and of power by over 51%, all compared to the initial full layout. HeLEx generates CGRAs that are on average only within 6.2% of theoretically minimum CGRAs that support exactly the number of operations needed by the input DFGs. A comparison with functional layouts produced by two state-of-the-art frameworks indicates that HeLEx achieves better reduction in the number of operations, by up to 2.6X.</description>

      <title>Pre-cache: A Microarchitectural Solution to prevent Meltdown and Spectre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that out-of-order and speculative execution mechanisms used to increase performance in the majority of processors expose the processors to critical attacks. These attacks, called Meltdown and Spectre, exploit the side effects of performance-enhancing features in modern microprocessors to expose secret data through side channels in the microarchitecture. The well known implementations of these attacks exploit cache-based side channels since they are the least noisy channels to exfiltrate data. While some software patches attempted to mitigate these attacks, they are ad-hoc and only try to fix the side effects of the vulnerabilites. They may also impose a performance overhead of up to 30%. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-based solution for Meltdown and Spectre that addresses the vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks. Our solution prevents flushed instructions from exposing data to the cache. Our approach can also be extended to other memory structures in the microarchitecture thereby preventing variants of the attacks which exploit these memory structures. We further identify two new variant attacks based on exploiting the side effects of speculative and out-of-order execution and show how our solution can be used to prevent these attacks. Evaluation results show that our microarchitectural solution not only restores secure out-of-order and speculative execution, but also has relatively low overhead and does not significantly impact performance for most applications.</description>

      <title>AVERY: Adaptive VLM Split Computing through Embodied Self-Awareness for Efficient Disaster Response Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>ioPUF+: A PUF Based on I/O Pull-Up/Down Resistors for Secret Key Generation in IoT Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present ioPUF+, which incorporates a novel Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) that generates unique fingerprints for Integrated Circuits (ICs) and the IoT nodes encompassing them. The proposed PUF generates device-specific responses by measuring the pull-up and pull-down resistor values on the I/O pins of the ICs, which naturally vary across chips due to manufacturing-induced process variations. Since these resistors are already integrated into the I/O structures of most ICs, ioPUF+ requires no custom circuitry, and no new IC fabrication. This makes ioPUF+ suitable for cost-sensitive embedded systems built from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Beyond introducing a new PUF, ioPUF+ includes a complete datapath for converting raw PUF responses into cryptographically usable secret keys using BCH error correction and SHA-256 hashing. Further ioPUF+ also demonstrate a practical use case of PUF derive secret keys in securing device-to-device communication using AES-encryption. We implemented ioPUF+ on the Infineon PSoC-5 microcontroller and evaluated its performance across 30 devices using standard PUF metrics. The results show excellent reliability (intra-device Hamming distance of 100.00%), strong uniqueness (inter-device Hamming distance of 50.33%), near-ideal uniformity (50.54%), and negligible bit aliasing. Stability tests under temperature and supply-voltage variations show worst-case bit-error rates of only 2.63% and 2.10%, respectively. We also profiled the resource and energy usage of the complete ioPUF+ system, including the PUF primitive, BCH decoding, SHA-256 hashing, and AES encryption. The full implementation requires only 19.8 KB of Flash, exhibits a latency of 600 ms, and consumes 79 mW of power, demonstrating the suitabilitiy of ioPUF+ for resource-constrained IoT nodes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Hardware-based Video Encoders on Modern GPUs for UHD Live-Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many GPUs have incorporated hardware-accelerated video encoders, which allow video encoding tasks to be offloaded from the main CPU and provide higher power efficiency. Over the years, many new video codecs such as H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 were added to the latest GPU boards. Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations. Finally, the bitrate required for each hardware encoder to match YouTube transcoding quality was also calculated.</description>

      <title>IOMMU Support for Virtual-Address Remote DMA in an ARMv8 environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality.
  First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically.
  Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hardware-efficient RBD accelerator based on FPGA, introducing three key innovations. First, we propose a precision-aware quantization framework that reduces DSP demand while preserving motion accuracy. This is also the first study to systematically evaluate quantization impact on robot control and motion for hardware acceleration. Second, we leverage a division deferring optimization in mass matrix inversion algorithm, which decouples reciprocal operations from the longest latency path to improve the performance. Finally, we present an inter-module DSP reuse methodology to improve DSP utilization and save DSP usage. Experiment results show that our work achieves up to 8x throughput improvement and 7.4x latency reduction over state-of-the-art RBD accelerators across various robot types, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for high-DOF robotic systems.</description>

Abstract: Systolic array accelerators execute CNNs with energy dominated by the switching activity of multiply accumulate (MAC) units. Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\% energy reduction with 2-3\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline.</description>
