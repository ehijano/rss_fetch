      <title>Control of Microrobots Using Model Predictive Control and Gaussian Processes for Disturbance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a control framework for magnetically actuated micron-scale robots ($\mu$bots) designed to mitigate disturbances and improve trajectory tracking. To address the challenges posed by unmodeled dynamics and environmental variability, we combine data-driven modeling with model-based control to accurately track desired trajectories using a relatively small amount of data. The system is represented with a simple linear model, and Gaussian Processes (GP) are employed to capture and estimate disturbances. This disturbance-enhanced model is then integrated into a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). Our approach demonstrates promising performance in both simulation and experimental setups, showcasing its potential for precise and reliable microrobot control in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Immersive Robot Programming Interface for Human-Guided Automation and Randomized Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers are exploring Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces for online robot programming to streamline automation and user interaction in variable manufacturing environments. This study introduces an AR interface for online programming and data visualization that integrates the human in the randomized robot path planning, reducing the inherent randomness of the methods with human intervention. The interface uses holographic items which correspond to physical elements to interact with a redundant manipulator. Utilizing Rapidly Random Tree Star (RRT*) and Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP) algorithms, the interface achieves end-effector s progression through collision-free path with smooth rotation. Next, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) achieve robot s configurations for this progression. The platform executes the RRT* algorithm in a loop, with each iteration independently exploring the shortest path through random sampling, leading to variations in the optimized paths produced. These paths are then demonstrated to AR users, who select the most appropriate path based on the environmental context and their intuition. The accuracy and effectiveness of the interface are validated through its implementation and testing with a seven Degree-OF-Freedom (DOF) manipulator, indicating its potential to advance current practices in robot programming. The validation of this paper include two implementations demonstrating the value of human-in-the-loop and context awareness in robotics.</description>

      <title>Collision-Affording Point Trees: SIMD-Amenable Nearest Neighbors for Fast Collision Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning against sensor data is often a critical bottleneck in real-time robot control. For sampling-based motion planners, which are effective for high-dimensional systems such as manipulators, the most time-intensive component is collision checking. We present a novel spatial data structure, the collision-affording point tree (CAPT): an exact representation of point clouds that accelerates collision-checking queries between robots and point clouds by an order of magnitude, with an average query time of less than 10 nanoseconds on 3D scenes comprising thousands of points. With the CAPT, sampling-based planners can generate valid, high-quality paths in under a millisecond, with total end-to-end computation time faster than 60 FPS, on a single thread of a consumer-grade CPU. We also present a point cloud filtering algorithm, based on space-filling curves, which reduces the number of points in a point cloud while preserving structure. Our approach enables robots to plan at real-time speeds in sensed environments, opening up potential uses of planning for high-dimensional systems in dynamic, changing, and unmodeled environments.</description>

      <title>W-RIZZ: A Weakly-Supervised Framework for Relative Traversability Estimation in Mobile Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful deployment of mobile robots in unstructured domains requires an understanding of the environment and terrain to avoid hazardous areas, getting stuck, and colliding with obstacles. Traversability estimation--which predicts where in the environment a robot can travel--is one prominent approach that tackles this problem. Existing geometric methods may ignore important semantic considerations, while semantic segmentation approaches involve a tedious labeling process. Recent self-supervised methods reduce labeling tedium, but require additional data or models and tend to struggle to explicitly label untraversable areas. To address these limitations, we introduce a weakly-supervised method for relative traversability estimation. Our method involves manually annotating the relative traversability of a small number of point pairs, which significantly reduces labeling effort compared to traditional segmentation-based methods and avoids the limitations of self-supervised methods. We further improve the performance of our method through a novel cross-image labeling strategy and loss function. We demonstrate the viability and performance of our method through deployment on a mobile robot in outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>TSPDiffuser: Diffusion Models as Learned Samplers for Traveling Salesperson Path Planning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents TSPDiffuser, a novel data-driven path planner for traveling salesperson path planning problems (TSPPPs) in environments rich with obstacles. Given a set of destinations within obstacle maps, our objective is to efficiently find the shortest possible collision-free path that visits all the destinations. In TSPDiffuser, we train a diffusion model on a large collection of TSPPP instances and their respective solutions to generate plausible paths for unseen problem instances. The model can then be employed as a learned sampler to construct a roadmap that contains potential solutions with a small number of nodes and edges. This approach enables efficient and accurate estimation of traveling costs between destinations, effectively addressing the primary computational challenge in solving TSPPPs. Experimental evaluations with diverse synthetic and real-world indoor/outdoor environments demonstrate the effectiveness of TSPDiffuser over existing methods in terms of the trade-off between solution quality and computational time requirements.</description>

      <title>Towards Interactive Autonomous Vehicle Testing: Vehicle-Under-Test-Centered Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation-based testing is essential for safely implementing autonomous vehicles (AVs) on roads, necessitating simulated traffic environments that dynamically interact with the Vehicle Under Test (VUT). This study introduces a VUT-Centered environmental Dynamics Inference (VCDI) model for realistic, interactive, and diverse background traffic simulation. VCDI is built on a Transformer-based trajectory inference model to generate trajectories for background objects. Serving the purpose of AV testing, VCDI additionally considers VUT-centered interactivity and scenario diversity using a conditional inference framework. First, the VUT future motion is taken as an augmented model input to bridge the interaction between VUT and background objects. Second, to enrich the scenario diversity, a Bayesian-network-based cost function module is designed. The module, learned in a distributional form, captures the uncertainty of the VUT's strategy, triggering various scenario evolution. Experimental results validate VCDI's trajectory-level simulation precision which outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory prediction work. The flexibility of the distributional cost function allows VCDI to provide diverse-yet-realistic scenarios for AV testing. We demonstrate such capability by modifying the anticipation to VUT's cost-based strategy and thus achieve multiple testing scenarios with explainable background traffic evolution.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Expanding Capacity of Autonomous Driving with Near-Miss Focused Training Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-tail distribution of real driving data poses challenges for training and testing autonomous vehicles (AV), where rare yet crucial safety-critical scenarios are infrequent. And virtual simulation offers a low-cost and efficient solution. This paper proposes a near-miss focused training framework for AV. Utilizing the driving scenario information provided by sensors in the simulator, we design novel reward functions, which enable background vehicles (BV) to generate near-miss scenarios and ensure gradients exist not only in collision-free scenes but also in collision scenarios. And then leveraging the Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) framework for simultaneous training of AV and BV to gradually enhance AV and BV capabilities, as well as generating near-miss scenarios tailored to different levels of AV capabilities. Results from three testing strategies indicate that the proposed method generates scenarios closer to near-miss, thus enhancing the capabilities of both AVs and BVs throughout training.</description>

      <title>Homotopic Path Set Planning for Robot Manipulation and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses path set planning that yields important applications in robot manipulation and navigation such as path generation for deformable object keypoints and swarms. A path set refers to the collection of finite agent paths to represent the overall spatial path of a group of keypoints or a swarm, whose collective properties meet spatial and topological constraints. As opposed to planning a single path, simultaneously planning multiple paths with constraints poses nontrivial challenges in complex environments. This paper presents a systematic planning pipeline for homotopic path sets, a widely applicable path set class in robotics. An extended visibility check condition is first proposed to attain a sparse passage distribution amidst dense obstacles. Passage-aware optimal path planning compatible with sampling-based planners is then designed for single path planning with adjustable costs. Large accessible free space for path set accommodation can be achieved by the planned path while having a sufficiently short path length. After specifying the homotopic properties of path sets, path set generation based on deformable path transfer is proposed in an efficient centralized manner. The effectiveness of these methods is validated by extensive simulated and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Real-time Motion Planning for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in self-driving car technologies have enabled them to navigate autonomously through various environments. However, one of the critical challenges in autonomous vehicle operation is trajectory planning, especially in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. This research aims to tackle this challenge by proposing a robust algorithm tailored for autonomous cars operating in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The algorithm introduces two main innovations. Firstly, it defines path density by adjusting the number of waypoints along the trajectory, optimizing their distribution for accuracy in curved areas and reducing computational complexity in straight sections. Secondly, it integrates hierarchical motion planning algorithms, combining global planning with an enhanced $A^*$ graph-based method and local planning using the time elastic band algorithm with moving obstacle detection considering different motion models. The proposed algorithm is adaptable for different vehicle types and mobile robots, making it versatile for real-world applications. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness across various conditions, promising safer and more efficient navigation for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. These modifications significantly improve trajectory planning capabilities, addressing a crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle technology.</description>

      <title>Robots Have Been Seen and Not Heard: Effects of Consequential Sounds on Human-Perception of Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many people expect robots to move fairly quietly, or make pleasant "beep boop" sounds or jingles similar to what they have observed in videos of robots. Unfortunately, this expectation of quietness does not match reality, as robots make machine sounds, known as 'consequential sounds', as they move and operate. As robots become more prevalent within society, understanding the sounds produced by robots and how these sounds are perceived by people is becoming increasingly important for positive human robot interactions (HRI). This paper investigates how people respond to the consequential sounds of robots, specifically how robots make a participant feel, how much they like the robot, would be distracted by the robot, and a person's desire to colocate with robots. Participants were shown 5 videos of different robots and asked their opinions on the robots and the sounds they made. This was compared with a control condition of completely silent videos. The results in this paper demonstrate with data from 182 participants (858 trials) that consequential sounds produced by robots have a significant negative effect on human perceptions of robots. Firstly there were increased negative 'associated affects' of the participants, such as making them feel more uncomfortable or agitated around the robot. Secondly, the presence of consequential sounds correlated with participants feeling more distracted and less able to focus. Thirdly participants reported being less likely to want to colocate in a shared environment with robots.</description>

      <title>FREA: Feasibility-Guided Generation of Safety-Critical Scenarios with Reasonable Adversariality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating safety-critical scenarios, which are essential yet difficult to collect at scale, offers an effective method to evaluate the robustness of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Existing methods focus on optimizing adversariality while preserving the naturalness of scenarios, aiming to achieve a balance through data-driven approaches. However, without an appropriate upper bound for adversariality, the scenarios might exhibit excessive adversariality, potentially leading to unavoidable collisions. In this paper, we introduce FREA, a novel safety-critical scenarios generation method that incorporates the Largest Feasible Region (LFR) of AV as guidance to ensure the reasonableness of the adversarial scenarios. Concretely, FREA initially pre-calculates the LFR of AV from offline datasets. Subsequently, it learns a reasonable adversarial policy that controls critical background vehicles (CBVs) in the scene to generate adversarial yet AV-feasible scenarios by maximizing a novel feasibility-dependent objective function. Extensive experiments illustrate that FREA can effectively generate safety-critical scenarios, yielding considerable near-miss events while ensuring AV's feasibility. Generalization analysis also confirms the robustness of FREA in AV testing across various surrogate AV methods and traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Semantic Traversability with Egocentric Video and Automated Annotation Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For reliable autonomous robot navigation in urban settings, the robot must have the ability to identify semantically traversable terrains in the image based on the semantic understanding of the scene. This reasoning ability is based on semantic traversability, which is frequently achieved using semantic segmentation models fine-tuned on the testing domain. This fine-tuning process often involves manual data collection with the target robot and annotation by human labelers which is prohibitively expensive and unscalable. In this work, we present an effective methodology for training a semantic traversability estimator using egocentric videos and an automated annotation process. Egocentric videos are collected from a camera mounted on a pedestrian's chest. The dataset for training the semantic traversability estimator is then automatically generated by extracting semantically traversable regions in each video frame using a recent foundation model in image segmentation and its prompting technique. Extensive experiments with videos taken across several countries and cities, covering diverse urban scenarios, demonstrate the high scalability and generalizability of the proposed annotation method. Furthermore, performance analysis and real-world deployment for autonomous robot navigation showcase that the trained semantic traversability estimator is highly accurate, able to handle diverse camera viewpoints, computationally light, and real-world applicable.

      <description>arXiv:2406.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimization study of the Vision-Language Frontier Maps (VLFM) applied to the Object Goal Navigation task in robotics. Our work evaluates the efficiency and performance of various vision-language models, object detectors, segmentation models, and multi-modal comprehension and Visual Question Answering modules. Using the $\textit{val-mini}$ and $\textit{val}$ splits of Habitat-Matterport 3D dataset, we conduct experiments on a desktop with limited VRAM. We propose a solution that achieves a higher success rate (+1.55%) improving over the VLFM BLIP-2 baseline without substantial success-weighted path length loss while requiring $\textbf{2.3 times}$ less video memory. Our findings provide insights into balancing model performance and computational efficiency, suggesting effective deployment strategies for resource-limited environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term safety in robotics is often understood as a synonym for avoidance. Although this perspective has led to progress in path planning and reactive control, a generalization of this perspective is necessary to include task semantics relevant to contact-rich manipulation tasks, especially during teleoperation and to ensure the safety of learned policies.
  We introduce the semantics-aware distance function and a corresponding computational method based on the Kelvin Transformation. The semantics-aware distance generalizes signed distance functions by allowing the zero level set to lie inside of the object in regions where contact is allowed, effectively incorporating task semantics -- such as object affordances and user intent -- in an adaptive implicit representation of safe sets. In validation experiments we show the capability of our method to adapt to time-varying semantic information, and to perform queries in sub-microsecond, enabling applications in reinforcement learning, trajectory optimization, and motion planning.</description>

      <title>Object Manipulation in Marine Environments using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing intervention tasks in the maritime domain is crucial for safety and operational efficiency. The unpredictable and dynamic marine environment makes the intervention tasks such as object manipulation extremely challenging. This study proposes a robust solution for object manipulation from a dock in the presence of disturbances caused by sea waves. To tackle this challenging problem, we apply a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm called Soft. Actor-Critic (SAC). SAC employs an actor-critic framework; the actors learn a policy that minimizes an objective function while the critic evaluates the learned policy and provides feedback to guide the actor-learning process. We trained the agent using the PyBullet dynamic simulator and tested it in a realistic simulation environment called MBZIRC maritime simulator. This simulator allows the simulation of different wave conditions according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) sea state code. Simulation results demonstrate a high success rate in retrieving the objects from the dock. The trained agent achieved an 80 percent success rate when applied in the simulation environment in the presence of waves characterized by sea state 2, according to the WMO sea state code</description>

      <title>Mission Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands a deep understanding of legal, spatial and temporal concepts in navigation. Hence, any implementation of AAM is forced to deal with the inherent uncertainties of human-inhabited spaces. Enabling growth and innovation requires the creation of a system for safe and robust mission design, i.e., the way we formalize intentions and decide their execution as trajectories for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Although legal frameworks have emerged to govern urban air spaces, their full integration into the decision process of autonomous agents and operators remains an open task. In this work we present ProMis, a system architecture for probabilistic mission design. It links the data available from various static and dynamic data sources with legal text and operator requirements by following principles of formal verification and probabilistic modeling. Hereby, ProMis enables the combination of low-level perception and high-level rules in AAM to infer validity over the UAV's state-space. To this end, we employ Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) as a unifying, intermediate representation between perception and action-taking. Furthermore, we present methods to connect ProMis with crowd-sourced map data by generating HPLP atoms that represent spatial relations in a probabilistic fashion. Our claims of the utility and generality of ProMis are supported by experiments on a diverse set of scenarios and a discussion of the computational demands associated with probabilistic missions.</description>

      <title>Constructive Safety-Critical Control: Synthesizing Control Barrier Functions for Partially Feedback Linearizable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certifying the safety of nonlinear systems, through the lens of set invariance and control barrier functions (CBFs), offers a powerful method for controller synthesis, provided a CBF can be constructed. This paper draws connections between partial feedback linearization and CBF synthesis. We illustrate that when a control affine system is input-output linearizable with respect to a smooth output function, then, under mild regularity conditions, one may extend any safety constraint defined on the output to a CBF for the full-order dynamics. These more general results are specialized to robotic systems where the conditions required to synthesize CBFs simplify. The CBFs constructed from our approach are applied and verified in simulation and hardware experiments on a quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Language Models can Infer Action Semantics for Classical Planners from Environment Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical planning approaches guarantee finding a set of actions that can achieve a given goal state when possible, but require an expert to specify logical action semantics that govern the dynamics of the environment. Researchers have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to directly infer planning steps based on commonsense knowledge and minimal domain information alone, but such plans often fail on execution. We bring together the strengths of classical planning and LLM commonsense inference to perform domain induction, learning and validating action pre- and post-conditions based on closed-loop interactions with the environment itself. We propose PSALM, which leverages LLM inference to heuristically complete partial plans emitted by a classical planner given partial domain knowledge, as well as to infer the semantic rules of the domain in a logical language based on environment feedback after execution. Our analysis on 7 environments shows that with just one expert-curated example plans, using LLMs as heuristic planners and rule predictors achieves lower environment execution steps and environment resets than random exploration while simultaneously recovering the underlying ground truth action semantics of the domain.</description>

      <title>Sound Heuristic Search Value Iteration for Undiscounted POMDPs with Reachability Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are powerful models for sequential decision making under transition and observation uncertainties. This paper studies the challenging yet important problem in POMDPs known as the (indefinite-horizon) Maximal Reachability Probability Problem (MRPP), where the goal is to maximize the probability of reaching some target states. This is also a core problem in model checking with logical specifications and is naturally undiscounted (discount factor is one). Inspired by the success of point-based methods developed for discounted problems, we study their extensions to MRPP. Specifically, we focus on trial-based heuristic search value iteration techniques and present a novel algorithm that leverages the strengths of these techniques for efficient exploration of the belief space (informed search via value bounds) while addressing their drawbacks in handling loops for indefinite-horizon problems. The algorithm produces policies with two-sided bounds on optimal reachability probabilities. We prove convergence to an optimal policy from below under certain conditions. Experimental evaluations on a suite of benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in almost all cases in both probability guarantees and computation time.</description>

      <title>Sparse Color-Code Net: Real-Time RGB-Based 6D Object Pose Estimation on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robotics and augmented reality applications increasingly rely on precise and efficient 6D object pose estimation, real-time performance on edge devices is required for more interactive and responsive systems. Our proposed Sparse Color-Code Net (SCCN) embodies a clear and concise pipeline design to effectively address this requirement. SCCN performs pixel-level predictions on the target object in the RGB image, utilizing the sparsity of essential object geometry features to speed up the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) computation process. Additionally, it introduces a novel pixel-level geometry-based object symmetry representation that seamlessly integrates with the initial pose predictions, effectively addressing symmetric object ambiguities. SCCN notably achieves an estimation rate of 19 frames per second (FPS) and 6 FPS on the benchmark LINEMOD dataset and the Occlusion LINEMOD dataset, respectively, for an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, while consistently maintaining high estimation accuracy at these rates.</description>

      <title>L-PR: Exploiting LiDAR Fiducial Marker for Unordered Low Overlap Multiview Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud registration is a prerequisite for many applications in computer vision and robotics. Most existing methods focus on pairwise registration of two point clouds with high overlap. Although there have been some methods for low overlap cases, they struggle in degraded scenarios. This paper introduces a novel framework named L-PR, designed to register unordered low overlap multiview point clouds leveraging LiDAR fiducial markers. We refer to them as LiDAR fiducial markers, but they are the same as the popular AprilTag and ArUco markers, thin sheets of paper that do not affect the 3D geometry of the environment. We first propose an improved adaptive threshold marker detection method to provide robust detection results when the viewpoints among point clouds change dramatically. Then, we formulate the unordered multiview point cloud registration problem as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem and develop a framework consisting of two levels of graphs to address it. The first-level graph, constructed as a weighted graph, is designed to efficiently and optimally infer initial values of scan poses from the unordered set. The second-level graph is constructed as a factor graph. By globally optimizing the variables on the graph, including scan poses, marker poses, and marker corner positions, we tackle the MAP problem. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superiority over competitors in four aspects: registration accuracy, instance reconstruction quality, localization accuracy, and robustness to the degraded scene. To benefit the community, we open-source our method and dataset at https://github.com/yorklyb/LiDAR-SFM.</description>

      <title>Rao-Blackwellized Particle Smoothing for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the task of building a map representation of an unknown environment while at the same time using it for positioning. A probabilistic interpretation of the SLAM task allows for incorporating prior knowledge and for operation under uncertainty. Contrary to the common practice of computing point estimates of the system states, we capture the full posterior density through approximate Bayesian inference. This dynamic learning task falls under state estimation, where the state-of-the-art is in sequential Monte Carlo methods that tackle the forward filtering problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for probabilistic SLAM using particle smoothing that does not only incorporate observed data in current state estimates, but it also back-tracks the updated knowledge to correct for past drift and ambiguities in both the map and in the states. Our solution can efficiently handle both dense and sparse map representations by Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally linear and conditionally linearized models. We show through simulations and real-world experiments how the principles apply to radio (BLE/Wi-Fi), magnetic field, and visual SLAM. The proposed solution is general, efficient, and works well under confounding noise.</description>

      <title>Push Past Green: Learning to Look Behind Plant Foliage by Moving It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agriculture applications (e.g., inspection, phenotyping, plucking fruits) require manipulating the plant foliage to look behind the leaves and the branches. Partial visibility, extreme clutter, thin structures, and unknown geometry and dynamics for plants make such manipulation challenging. We tackle these challenges through data-driven methods. We use self-supervision to train SRPNet, a neural network that predicts what space is revealed on execution of a candidate action on a given plant. We use SRPNet with the cross-entropy method to predict actions that are effective at revealing space beneath plant foliage. Furthermore, as SRPNet does not just predict how much space is revealed but also where it is revealed, we can execute a sequence of actions that incrementally reveal more and more space beneath the plant foliage. We experiment with a synthetic (vines) and a real plant (Dracaena) on a physical test-bed across 5 settings including 2 settings that test generalization to novel plant configurations. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of our overall method, PPG, over a competitive hand-crafted exploration method, and the effectiveness of SRPNet over a hand-crafted dynamics model and relevant ablations.</description>

      <title>TempFuser: Learning Agile, Tactical, and Acrobatic Flight Maneuvers Using a Long Short-Term Temporal Fusion Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dogfighting is a challenging scenario in aerial applications that requires a comprehensive understanding of both strategic maneuvers and the aerodynamics of agile aircraft. The aerial agent needs to not only understand tactically evolving maneuvers of fighter jets from a long-term perspective but also react to rapidly changing aerodynamics of aircraft from a short-term viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TempFuser, a novel long short-term temporal fusion transformer architecture that can learn agile, tactical, and acrobatic flight maneuvers in complex dogfight problems. Our approach integrates two distinct temporal transition embeddings into a transformer-based network to comprehensively capture both the long-term tactics and short-term agility of aerial agents. By incorporating these perspectives, our policy network generates end-to-end flight commands that secure dominant positions over the long term and effectively outmaneuver agile opponents. After training in a high-fidelity flight simulator, our model successfully learns to execute strategic maneuvers, outperforming baseline policy models against various types of opponent aircraft. Notably, our model exhibits human-like acrobatic maneuvers even when facing adversaries with superior specifications, all without relying on explicit prior knowledge. Moreover, it demonstrates robust pursuit performance in challenging supersonic and low-altitude situations. Demo videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/tempfuser.</description>

Abstract: Robotics affordances, providing information about what actions can be taken in a given situation, can aid robotics manipulation. However, learning about affordances requires expensive large annotated datasets of interactions or demonstrations. In this work, we show active learning can mitigate this problem and propose the use of uncertainty to drive an interactive affordance discovery process. We show that our method enables the efficient discovery of visual affordances for several action primitives, such as grasping, stacking objects, or opening drawers, strongly improving data efficiency and allowing us to learn grasping affordances on a real-world setup with an xArm 6 robot arm in a small number of trials.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Meets DAgger: Supercharging Eye-in-hand Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common failure mode for policies trained with imitation is compounding execution errors at test time. When the learned policy encounters states that are not present in the expert demonstrations, the policy fails, leading to degenerate behavior. The Dataset Aggregation, or DAgger approach to this problem simply collects more data to cover these failure states. However, in practice, this is often prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose Diffusion Meets DAgger (DMD), a method to reap the benefits of DAgger without the cost for eye-in-hand imitation learning problems. Instead of collecting new samples to cover out-of-distribution states, DMD uses recent advances in diffusion models to synthesize these samples. This leads to robust performance from few demonstrations. We compare DMD against behavior cloning baseline across four tasks: pushing, stacking, pouring, and shirt hanging. In pushing, DMD achieves 80% success rate with as few as 8 expert demonstrations, where naive behavior cloning reaches only 20%. In stacking, DMD succeeds on average 92% of the time across 5 cups, versus 40% for BC. When pouring coffee beans, DMD transfers to another cup successfully 80% of the time. Finally, DMD attains 90% success rate for hanging shirt on a clothing rack.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop an open-source surgical simulation environment that includes a realistic model obtained by MRI-scanning a physical phantom, for the purpose of training and evaluating a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithm for autonomous suturing. The LfD algorithm utilizes Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), but focuses on the needle trajectory, rather than the instruments, to obtain better generality with respect to needle grasps. We conduct a user study to collect multiple suturing demonstrations and perform a comprehensive analysis of the ability of the LfD algorithm to generalize from a demonstration at one location in one phantom to different locations in the same phantom and to a different phantom. Our results indicate good generalization, on the order of 91.5%, when learning from more experienced subjects, indicating the need to integrate skill assessment in the future.</description>

      <title>Prepared for the Worst: A Learning-Based Adversarial Attack for Resilience Analysis of the ICP Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to assess the resilience of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm via deep-learning-based attacks on lidar point clouds. For safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation, ensuring the resilience of algorithms prior to deployments is of utmost importance. The ICP algorithm has become the standard for lidar-based localization. However, the pose estimate it produces can be greatly affected by corruption in the measurements. Corruption can arise from a variety of scenarios such as occlusions, adverse weather, or mechanical issues in the sensor. Unfortunately, the complex and iterative nature of ICP makes assessing its resilience to corruption challenging. While there have been efforts to create challenging datasets and develop simulations to evaluate the resilience of ICP empirically, our method focuses on finding the maximum possible ICP pose error using perturbation-based adversarial attacks. The proposed attack induces significant pose errors on ICP and outperforms baselines more than 88% of the time across a wide range of scenarios. As an example application, we demonstrate that our attack can be used to identify areas on a map where ICP is particularly vulnerable to corruption in the measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical reasoning is important for effective robot manipulation. Recent work has investigated both vision and language modalities for physical reasoning; vision can reveal information about objects in the environment and language serves as an abstraction and communication medium for additional context. Although these works have demonstrated success on a variety of physical reasoning tasks, they are limited to physical properties that can be inferred from visual or language inputs. In this work, we investigate combining tactile perception with language, which enables embodied systems to obtain physical properties through interaction and apply commonsense reasoning. We contribute a new dataset PhysiCLeAR, which comprises both physical/property reasoning tasks and annotated tactile videos obtained using a GelSight tactile sensor. We then introduce Octopi, a system that leverages both tactile representation learning and large vision-language models to predict and reason about tactile inputs with minimal language fine-tuning. Our evaluations on PhysiCLeAR show that Octopi is able to effectively use intermediate physical property predictions to improve its performance on various tactile-related tasks. PhysiCLeAR and Octopi are available at https://github.com/clear-nus/octopi.</description>

Abstract: Off-road autonomy validation presents unique challenges due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of off-road environments. Traditional methods focusing on sequentially sweeping across the parameter space for variability analysis struggle to comprehensively assess the performance and safety of off-road autonomous systems within the imposed time constraints. This paper proposes leveraging scalable digital twin simulations within high-performance computing (HPC) clusters to address this challenge. By harnessing the computational power of HPC clusters, our approach aims to provide a scalable and efficient means to validate off-road autonomy algorithms, enabling rapid iteration and testing of autonomy algorithms under various conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through performance evaluations of the HPC cluster in terms of simulation parallelization and present the systematic variability analysis of a candidate off-road autonomy algorithm to identify potential vulnerabilities in the autonomy stack's perception, planning and control modules.</description>

Abstract: Learning a single universal policy that can perform a diverse set of manipulation tasks is a promising new direction in robotics. However, existing techniques are limited to learning policies that can only perform tasks that are encountered during training, and require a large number of demonstrations to learn new tasks. Humans, on the other hand, often can learn a new task from a single unannotated demonstration. In this work, we propose the Invariance-Matching One-shot Policy Learning (IMOP) algorithm. In contrast to the standard practice of learning the end-effector's pose directly, IMOP first learns invariant regions of the state space for a given task, and then computes the end-effector's pose through matching the invariant regions between demonstrations and test scenes. Trained on the 18 RLBench tasks, IMOP achieves a success rate that outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently, by 4.5% on average over the 18 tasks. More importantly, IMOP can learn a novel task from a single unannotated demonstration, and without any fine-tuning, and achieves an average success rate improvement of $11.5\%$ over the state-of-the-art on 22 novel tasks selected across nine categories. IMOP can also generalize to new shapes and learn to manipulate objects that are different from those in the demonstration. Further, IMOP can perform one-shot sim-to-real transfer using a single real-robot demonstration.</description>

Abstract: Building and maintaining High-Definition (HD) maps represents a large barrier to autonomous vehicle deployment. This, along with advances in modern online map detection models, has sparked renewed interest in the online mapping problem. However, effectively predicting online maps at a high enough quality to enable safe, driverless deployments remains a significant challenge. Recent work on these models proposes training robust online mapping systems using low quality map priors with synthetic perturbations in an attempt to simulate out-of-date HD map priors. In this paper, we investigate how models trained on these synthetically perturbed map priors generalize to performance on deployment-scale, real world map changes. We present a large-scale experimental study to determine which synthetic perturbations are most useful in generalizing to real world HD map changes, evaluated using multiple years of real-world autonomous driving data. We show there is still a substantial sim2real gap between synthetic prior perturbations and observed real-world changes, which limits the utility of current prior-informed HD map prediction models.</description>

      <title>Solution Concepts in Hierarchical Games under Bounded Rationality with Applications to Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.10033v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With autonomous vehicles (AV) set to integrate further into regular human traffic, there is an increasing consensus on treating AV motion planning as a multi-agent problem. However, the traditional game-theoretic assumption of complete rationality is too strong for human driving, and there is a need for understanding human driving as a \emph{bounded rational} activity through a behavioural game-theoretic lens. To that end, we adapt four metamodels of bounded rational behaviour: three based on Quantal level-k and one based on Nash equilibrium with quantal errors. We formalize the different solution concepts that can be applied in the context of hierarchical games, a framework used in multi-agent motion planning, for the purpose of creating game theoretic models of driving behaviour. Furthermore, based on a contributed dataset of human driving at a busy urban intersection with a total of approximately 4k agents and 44k decision points, we evaluate the behaviour models on the basis of model fit to naturalistic data, as well as their predictive capacity. Our results suggest that among the behaviour models evaluated, at the level of maneuvers, modeling driving behaviour as an adaptation of the Quantal level-k model with level-0 behaviour modelled as pure rule-following provides the best fit to naturalistic driving behaviour. At the level of trajectories, bounds sampling of actions and a maxmax non-strategic models is the most accurate within the set of models in comparison. We also find a significant impact of situational factors on the performance of behaviour models.</description>

      <title>Fiducial Tag Localization on a 3D LiDAR Prior Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LiDAR fiducial tag, akin to the well-known AprilTag used in camera applications, serves as a convenient resource to impart artificial features to the LiDAR sensor, facilitating robotics applications. Unfortunately, the existing LiDAR fiducial tag localization methods do not apply to 3D LiDAR maps while resolving this problem is beneficial to LiDAR-based relocalization and navigation. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to directly localize fiducial tags on a 3D LiDAR prior map, returning the tag poses (labeled by ID number) and vertex locations (labeled by index) w.r.t. the global coordinate system of the map. In particular, considering that fiducial tags are thin sheet objects indistinguishable from the attached planes, we design a new pipeline that gradually analyzes the 3D point cloud of the map from the intensity and geometry perspectives, extracting potential tag-containing point clusters. Then, we introduce an intermediate-plane-based method to further check if each potential cluster has a tag and compute the vertex locations and tag pose if found. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that our approach is the first method applicable to localize tags on a 3D LiDAR map while achieving better accuracy compared to previous methods.

      <title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Task Offline Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretraining reinforcement learning (RL) models on offline datasets is a promising way to improve their training efficiency in online tasks, but challenging due to the inherent mismatch in dynamics and behaviors across various tasks. We present a model-based RL method that learns to transfer potentially useful dynamics and action demonstrations from offline data to a novel task. The main idea is to use the world models not only as simulators for behavior learning but also as tools to measure the task relevance for both dynamics representation transfer and policy transfer. We build a time-varying, domain-selective distillation loss to generate a set of offline-to-online similarity weights. These weights serve two purposes: (i) adaptively transferring the task-agnostic knowledge of physical dynamics to facilitate world model training, and (ii) learning to replay relevant source actions to guide the target policy. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods in Meta-World and DeepMind Control Suite.</description>

      <title>Recursively-Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many sequential decision problems involve optimizing one objective function while imposing constraints on other objectives. Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (C-POMDP) model this case with transition uncertainty and partial observability. In this work, we first show that C-POMDPs violate the optimal substructure property over successive decision steps and thus may exhibit behaviors that are undesirable for some (e.g., safety critical) applications. Additionally, online re-planning in C-POMDPs is often ineffective due to the inconsistency resulting from this violation. To address these drawbacks, we introduce the Recursively-Constrained POMDP (RC-POMDP), which imposes additional history-dependent cost constraints on the C-POMDP. We show that, unlike C-POMDPs, RC-POMDPs always have deterministic optimal policies and that optimal policies obey Bellman's principle of optimality. We also present a point-based dynamic programming algorithm for RC-POMDPs. Evaluations on benchmark problems demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm and show that policies for RC-POMDPs produce more desirable behaviors than policies for C-POMDPs.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Interpretable End-to-End Learning via Latent Functional Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MoNet, a novel functionally modular network for self-supervised and interpretable end-to-end learning. By leveraging its functional modularity with a latent-guided contrastive loss function, MoNet efficiently learns task-specific decision-making processes in latent space without requiring task-level supervision. Moreover, our method incorporates an online, post-hoc explainability approach that enhances the interpretability of end-to-end inferences without compromising sensorimotor control performance. In real-world indoor environments, MoNet demonstrates effective visual autonomous navigation, outperforming baseline models by 7% to 28% in task specificity analysis. We further explore the interpretability of our network through post-hoc analysis of perceptual saliency maps and latent decision vectors. This provides valuable insights into the incorporation of explainable artificial intelligence into robotic learning, encompassing both perceptual and behavioral perspectives.

      <title>Lyapunov-stable Neural Control for State and Output Feedback: A Novel Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance in a wide range of tasks in robotics and control. However, formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees over the region-of-attraction (ROA) for NN controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging to obtain, and most existing approaches rely on expensive solvers such as sums-of-squares (SOS), mixed-integer programming (MIP), or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). In this paper, we demonstrate a new framework for learning NN controllers together with Lyapunov certificates using fast empirical falsification and strategic regularizations. We propose a novel formulation that defines a larger verifiable region-of-attraction (ROA) than shown in the literature, and refines the conventional restrictive constraints on Lyapunov derivatives to focus only on certifiable ROAs. The Lyapunov condition is rigorously verified post-hoc using branch-and-bound with scalable linear bound propagation-based NN verification techniques. The approach is efficient and flexible, and the full training and verification procedure is accelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT. The flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow us to demonstrate Lyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based controllers and NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first time in literature.

      <title>AnoVox: A Benchmark for Multimodal Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scale-up of autonomous vehicles depends heavily on their ability to deal with anomalies, such as rare objects on the road. In order to handle such situations, it is necessary to detect anomalies in the first place. Anomaly detection for autonomous driving has made great progress in the past years but suffers from poorly designed benchmarks with a strong focus on camera data. In this work, we propose AnoVox, the largest benchmark for ANOmaly detection in autonomous driving to date. AnoVox incorporates large-scale multimodal sensor data and spatial VOXel ground truth, allowing for the comparison of methods independent of their used sensor. We propose a formal definition of normality and provide a compliant training dataset. AnoVox is the first benchmark to contain both content and temporal anomalies.</description>

      <title>Fourier Controller Networks for Real-Time Decision-Making in Embodied Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer has shown promise in reinforcement learning to model time-varying features for obtaining generalized low-level robot policies on diverse robotics datasets in embodied learning. However, it still suffers from the issues of low data efficiency and high inference latency. In this paper, we propose to investigate the task from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that the energy density in the frequency domain of a robot's trajectory is mainly concentrated in the low-frequency part. Then, we present the Fourier Controller Network (FCNet), a new network that uses Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract and encode time-varying features through frequency domain interpolation. In order to do real-time decision-making, we further adopt FFT and Sliding DFT methods in the model architecture to achieve parallel training and efficient recurrent inference. Extensive results in both simulated (e.g., D4RL) and real-world environments (e.g., robot locomotion) demonstrate FCNet's substantial efficiency and effectiveness over existing methods such as Transformer, e.g., FCNet outperforms Transformer on multi-environmental robotics datasets of all types of sizes (from 1.9M to 120M).

      <title>From Seedling to Harvest: The GrowingSoy Dataset for Weed Detection in Soy Crops via Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in computer vision, especially in agricultural tasks. Recent advancements in instance segmentation have improved image classification accuracy. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset for training neural networks to detect weeds and soy plants through instance segmentation. Our dataset covers various stages of soy growth, offering a chronological perspective on weed invasion's impact, with 1,000 meticulously annotated images. We also provide 6 state of the art models, trained in this dataset, that can understand and detect soy and weed in every stage of the plantation process. By using this dataset for weed and soy segmentation, we achieved a segmentation average precision of 79.1% and an average recall of 69.2% across all plant classes, with the YOLOv8X model. Moreover, the YOLOv8M model attained 78.7% mean average precision (mAp-50) in caruru weed segmentation, 69.7% in grassy weed segmentation, and 90.1% in soy plant segmentation.</description>

      <title>High-speed odour sensing using miniaturised electronic nose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals have evolved to rapidly detect and recognise brief and intermittent encounters with odour packages, exhibiting recognition capabilities within milliseconds. Artificial olfaction has faced challenges in achieving comparable results -- existing solutions are either slow; or bulky, expensive, and power-intensive -- limiting applicability in real-world scenarios for mobile robotics. Here we introduce a miniaturised high-speed electronic nose; characterised by high-bandwidth sensor readouts, tightly controlled sensing parameters and powerful algorithms. The system is evaluated on a high-fidelity odour delivery benchmark. We showcase successful classification of tens-of-millisecond odour pulses, and demonstrate temporal pattern encoding of stimuli switching with up to 60 Hz. Those timescales are unprecedented in miniaturised low-power settings, and demonstrably exceed the performance observed in mice. For the first time, it is possible to match the temporal resolution of animal olfaction in robotic systems. This will allow for addressing challenges in environmental and industrial monitoring, security, neuroscience, and beyond.</description>
