      <title>SoundBreak: A Systematic Study of Audio-Only Adversarial Attacks on Trimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models that integrate audio, vision, and language achieve strong performance on reasoning and generation tasks, yet their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains poorly understood. We study a realistic and underexplored threat model: untargeted, audio-only adversarial attacks on trimodal audio-video-language models. We analyze six complementary attack objectives that target different stages of multimodal processing, including audio encoder representations, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and output likelihoods. Across three state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, we show that audio-only perturbations can induce severe multimodal failures, achieving up to 96% attack success rate. We further show that attacks can be successful at low perceptual distortions (LPIPS &lt;= 0.08, SI-SNR &gt;= 0) and benefit more from extended optimization than increased data scale. Transferability across models and encoders remains limited, while speech recognition systems such as Whisper primarily respond to perturbation magnitude, achieving &gt;97% attack success under severe distortion. These results expose a previously overlooked single-modality attack surface in multimodal systems and motivate defenses that enforce cross-modal consistency.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Embedding Refinement in Personalized Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized speech enhancement (PSE) has shown convincing results when it comes to extracting a known target voice among interfering ones. The corresponding systems usually incorporate a representation of the target voice within the enhancement system, which is extracted from an enrollment clip of the target voice with upstream models. Those models are generally heavy as the speaker embedding's quality directly affects PSE performances. Yet, embeddings generated beforehand cannot account for the variations of the target voice during inference time. In this paper, we propose to perform on-thefly refinement of the speaker embedding using a tiny speaker encoder. We first introduce a novel contrastive knowledge distillation methodology in order to train a 150k-parameter encoder from complex embeddings. We then use this encoder within the enhancement system during inference and show that the proposed method greatly improves PSE performances while maintaining a low computational load.</description>

      <title>The CMU-AIST submission for the ICME 2025 Audio Encoder Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report describes our submission to the ICME 2025 audio encoder challenge. Our submitted system is built on BEATs, a masked speech token prediction based audio encoder. We extend the BEATs model using 74,000 hours of data derived from various speech, music, and sound corpora and scale its architecture upto 300 million parameters. We experiment with speech-heavy and balanced pre-training mixtures to study the impact of different domains on final performance. Our submitted system consists of an ensemble of the Dasheng 1.2 billion model with two custom scaled-up BEATs models trained on the aforementioned pre-training data mixtures. We also propose a simple ensembling technique that retains the best capabilities of constituent models and surpasses both the baseline and Dasheng 1.2B. For open science, we publicly release our trained checkpoints via huggingface at https://huggingface.co/shikhar7ssu/OpenBEATs-ICME-SOUND and https://huggingface.co/shikhar7ssu/OpenBEATs-ICME.</description>

      <title>Do Models Hear Like Us? Probing the Representational Alignment of Audio LLMs and Naturalistic EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating speech perception with language understanding. However, whether their internal representations align with human neural dynamics during naturalistic listening remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically examine layer-wise representational alignment between 12 open-source Audio LLMs and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across 2 datasets. Specifically, we employ 8 similarity metrics, such as Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), to characterize within-sentence representational geometry. Our analysis reveals 3 key findings: (1) we observe a rank-dependence split, in which model rankings vary substantially across different similarity metrics; (2) we identify spatio-temporal alignment patterns characterized by depth-dependent alignment peaks and a pronounced increase in RSA within the 250-500 ms time window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics; (3) we find an affective dissociation whereby negative prosody, identified using a proposed Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC) criterion, reduces geometric similarity while enhancing covariance-based dependence. These findings provide new neurobiological insights into the representational mechanisms of Audio LLMs.</description>

      <title>CORD: Bridging the Audio-Text Reasoning Gap via Weighted On-policy Cross-modal Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have garnered significant research interest. Despite being built upon text-based large language models (LLMs), LALMs frequently exhibit a degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation stems from the failure of current training paradigms to effectively bridge the acoustic-semantic gap within the feature representation space. To address this challenge, we propose CORD, a unified alignment framework that performs online cross-modal self-distillation. Specifically, it aligns audio-conditioned reasoning with its text-conditioned counterpart within a unified model. Leveraging the text modality as an internal teacher, CORD performs multi-granularity alignment throughout the audio rollout process. At the token level, it employs on-policy reverse KL divergence with importance-aware weighting to prioritize early and semantically critical tokens. At the sequence level, CORD introduces a judge-based global reward to optimize complete reasoning trajectories via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CORD consistently enhances audio-conditioned reasoning and substantially bridges the audio-text performance gap with only 80k synthetic training samples, validating the efficacy and data efficiency of our on-policy, multi-level cross-modal alignment approach.</description>

      <title>Omni-directional attention mechanism based on Mamba for speech separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mamba, a selective state-space model (SSM), has emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformers for speech modeling, enabling long-sequence processing with linear complexity. While effective in speech separation, existing approaches, whether in the time or time-frequency domain, typically decompose the input along a single dimension into short one-dimensional sequences before processing them with Mamba, which restricts it to local 1D modeling and limits its ability to capture global dependencies across the 2D spectrogram. In this work, we propose an efficient omni-directional attention (OA) mechanism built upon unidirectional Mamba, which models global dependencies from ten different directions on the spectrogram. We expand the proposed mechanism into two baseline separation models and evaluate on three public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach consistently achieves significant performance gains over the baselines while preserving linear complexity, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.</description>

      <title>I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues: Causal Analysis for Audio Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that audio classifiers often rely on non-musically relevant features and spurious correlations to classify audio. Hence audio classifiers are easy to manipulate or confuse, resulting in wrong classifications. While inducing a misclassification is not hard, until now the set of features that the classifiers rely on was not well understood.
  In this paper we introduce a new method that uses causal reasoning to discover features of the frequency space that are sufficient and necessary for a given classification. We describe an implementation of this algorithm in the tool FreqReX and provide experimental results on a number of standard benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that causally sufficient and necessary subsets allow us to manipulate the outputs of the models in a variety of ways by changing the input very slightly. Namely, a change to one out of 240,000 frequencies results in a change in classification 58% of the time, and the change can be so small that it is practically inaudible. These results show that causal analysis is useful for understanding the reasoning process of audio classifiers and can be used to successfully manipulate their outputs.</description>

      <title>E2E-AEC: Implementing an end-to-end neural network learning approach for acoustic echo cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural network-based end-to-end acoustic echo cancellation (E2E-AEC) method capable of streaming inference, which operates effectively without reliance on traditional linear AEC (LAEC) techniques and time delay estimation. Our approach includes several key strategies: First, we introduce and refine progressive learning to gradually enhance echo suppression. Second, our model employs knowledge transfer by initializing with a pre-trained LAECbased model, harnessing the insights gained from LAEC training. Third, we optimize the attention mechanism with a loss function applied on attention weights to achieve precise time alignment between the reference and microphone signals. Lastly, we incorporate voice activity detection to enhance speech quality and improve echo removal by masking the network output when near-end speech is absent. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through experiments conducted on public datasets.</description>

      <title>A Novel Transfer Learning Approach for Mental Stability Classification from Voice Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel transfer learning approach and data augmentation technique for mental stability classification using human voice signals and addresses the challenges associated with limited data availability. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to analyse spectrogram images generated from voice recordings. Three CNN architectures, VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, were evaluated across three experimental phases: training on non-augmented data, augmented data, and transfer learning. This proposed transfer learning approach involves pre-training models on the augmented dataset and fine-tuning them on the non-augmented dataset while ensuring strict data separation to prevent data leakage. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance compared to the baseline approach. Among three CNN architectures, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy of 94% and an AUC score of 99% using the proposed transfer learning approach. This finding highlights the effectiveness of combining data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance CNN-based classification of mental stability using voice spectrograms, offering a promising non-invasive tool for mental health diagnostics.</description>

      <title>ES4R: Speech Encoding Based on Prepositive Affective Modeling for Empathetic Response Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empathetic speech dialogue requires not only understanding linguistic content but also perceiving rich paralinguistic information such as prosody, tone, and emotional intensity for affective understandings. Existing speech-to-speech large language models either rely on ASR transcription or use encoders to extract latent representations, often weakening affective information and contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we propose \textbf{ES4R}, a framework for speech-based empathetic response generation. Our core innovation lies in explicitly modeling structured affective context before speech encoding, rather than relying on implicit learning by the encoder or explicit emotion supervision. Specifically, we introduce a dual-level attention mechanism to capture turn-level affective states and dialogue-level affective dynamics. The resulting affective representations are then integrated with textual semantics through speech-guided cross-modal attention to generate empathetic responses. For speech output, we employ energy-based strategy selection and style fusion to achieve empathetic speech synthesis. ES4R consistently outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and human evaluations and remains robust across different LLM backbones.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Speech LLMs for Multi-Aspect Evaluation of L2 Speech: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate assessment of L2 English pronunciation is crucial for language learning, as it provides personalized feedback and ensures a fair evaluation of individual progress. However, automated scoring remains challenging due to the complexity of sentence-level fluency, prosody, and completeness. This paper evaluates the zero-shot performance of Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, an instruction-tuned speech-LLM, on 5,000 Speechocean762 utterances. The model generates rubric-aligned scores for accuracy, fluency, prosody, and completeness, showing strong agreement with human ratings within +-2 tolerance, especially for high-quality speech. However, it tends to overpredict low-quality speech scores and lacks precision in error detection. These findings demonstrate the strong potential of speech LLMs in scalable pronunciation assessment and suggest future improvements through enhanced prompting, calibration, and phonetic integration to advance Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical utility of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems is undermined by their fragility to domain shifts, such as speaker variability, the distinction between acted and naturalistic emotions, and cross-corpus variations. While domain adaptation and fine-tuning are widely studied, they require either source data or labelled target data, which are often unavailable or raise privacy concerns in SER. Test-time adaptation (TTA) bridges this gap by adapting models at inference using only unlabeled target data. Yet, having been predominantly designed for image classification and speech recognition, the efficacy of TTA for mitigating the unique domain shifts in SER has not been investigated. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation and comparison covering 11 TTA methods across three representative SER tasks. The results indicate that backpropagation-free TTA methods are the most promising. Conversely, entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling generally fail, as their core assumption of a single, confident ground-truth label is incompatible with the inherent ambiguity of emotional expression. Further, no single method universally excels, and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the distributional shifts and tasks.</description>

      <title>EdgeSpot: Efficient and High-Performance Few-Shot Model for Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient few-shot keyword spotting model for edge devices, EdgeSpot, that pairs an optimized version of a BC-ResNet-based acoustic backbone with a trainable Per-Channel Energy Normalization frontend and lightweight temporal self-attention. Knowledge distillation is utilized during training by employing a self-supervised teacher model, optimized with Sub-center ArcFace loss. This study demonstrates that the EdgeSpot model consistently provides better accuracy at a fixed false-alarm rate (FAR) than strong BC-ResNet baselines. The largest variant, EdgeSpot-4, improves the 10-shot accuracy at 1% FAR from 73.7% to 82.0%, which requires only 29.4M MACs with 128k parameters.</description>

      <title>TidyVoice: A Curated Multilingual Dataset for Speaker Verification Derived from Common Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust, multilingual speaker recognition systems is hindered by a lack of large-scale, publicly available and multilingual datasets, particularly for the read-speech style crucial for applications like anti-spoofing. To address this gap, we introduce the TidyVoice dataset derived from the Mozilla Common Voice corpus after mitigating its inherent speaker heterogeneity within the provided client IDs. TidyVoice currently contains training and test data from over 212,000 monolingual speakers (Tidy-M) and around 4,500 multilingual speakers (Tidy-X) from which we derive two distinct conditions. The Tidy-M condition contains target and non-target trials from monolingual speakers across 81 languages. The Tidy-X condition contains target and non-target trials from multilingual speakers in both same- and cross-language trials. We employ two architectures of ResNet models, achieving a 0.35% EER by fine-tuning on our comprehensive Tidy-M partition. Moreover, we show that this fine-tuning enhances the model's generalization, improving performance on unseen conversational interview data from the CANDOR corpus. The complete dataset, evaluation trials, and our models are publicly released to provide a new resource for the community.</description>

      <title>Auditory Attention Decoding without Spatial Information: A Diotic EEG Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16442</link>

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) identifies the attended speech stream in multi-speaker environments by decoding brain signals such as electroencephalography (EEG). This technology is essential for realizing smart hearing aids that address the cocktail party problem and for facilitating objective audiometry systems. Existing AAD research mainly utilizes dichotic environments where different speech signals are presented to the left and right ears, enabling models to classify directional attention rather than speech content. However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the "cocktail party" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations. We evaluate our method on a diotic EEG dataset and achieve 72.70% accuracy, which is 22.58% higher than the state-of-the-art direction-based AAD method.</description>

      <title>WildScore: Benchmarking MLLMs in-the-Wild Symbolic Music Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries. Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We release the dataset and code.</description>

      <title>Cross-Lingual F5-TTS: Towards Language-Agnostic Voice Cloning and Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow-matching-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have shown high-quality speech synthesis. However, most current flow-matching-based TTS models still rely on reference transcripts corresponding to the audio prompt for synthesis. This dependency prevents cross-lingual voice cloning when audio prompt transcripts are unavailable, particularly for unseen languages. The key challenges for flow-matching-based TTS models to remove audio prompt transcripts are identifying word boundaries during training and determining appropriate duration during inference. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Lingual F5-TTS, a framework that enables cross-lingual voice cloning without audio prompt transcripts. Our method preprocesses audio prompts by forced alignment to obtain word boundaries, enabling direct synthesis from audio prompts while excluding transcripts during training. To address the duration modeling challenge, we train speaking rate predictors at different linguistic granularities to derive duration from speaker pace. Experiments show that our approach matches the performance of F5-TTS while enabling cross-lingual voice cloning.</description>

      <title>SONAR: Self-Distilled Continual Pre-training for Domain Adaptive Audio Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets like AudioSet has become the dominant paradigm for audio representation learning. While the continuous influx of new, unlabeled audio presents an opportunity to enrich these static representations, a naive approach is to retrain the model from scratch using all available data. However, this method is computationally prohibitive and discards the valuable knowledge embedded in the previously trained model weights. To address this inefficiency, we propose SONAR (Self-distilled cONtinual pre-training for domain adaptive Audio Representation), a continual pre-training framework built upon BEATs. SONAR effectively adapts to new domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by tackling three key challenges: implementing a joint sampling strategy for new and prior data, applying regularization to balance specificity and generality, and dynamically expanding the tokenizer codebook for novel acoustic patterns. Experiments across four distinct domains demonstrate that our method achieves both high adaptability and robust resistance to forgetting.</description>

      <title>Etude: Piano Cover Generation with a Three-Stage Approach -- Extract, strucTUralize, and DEcode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piano cover generation aims to automatically transform a pop song into a piano arrangement. While numerous deep learning approaches have been proposed, existing models often fail to maintain structural consistency with the original song, likely due to the absence of beat-aware mechanisms or the difficulty of modeling complex rhythmic patterns. Rhythmic information is crucial, as it defines structural similarity (e.g., tempo, BPM) and directly impacts the overall quality of the generated music.
  In this paper, we introduce Etude, a three-stage architecture consisting of Extract, strucTUralize, and DEcode stages. By pre-extracting rhythmic information and applying a novel, simplified REMI-based tokenization, our model produces covers that preserve proper song structure, enhance fluency and musical dynamics, and support highly controllable generation through style injection. Subjective evaluations with human listeners show that Etude substantially outperforms prior models, achieving a quality level comparable to that of human composers.</description>

      <title>MusiCRS: Benchmarking Audio-Centric Conversational Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational recommendation has advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet music remains a uniquely challenging domain in which effective recommendations require reasoning over audio content beyond what text or metadata can capture. We present MusiCRS, the first benchmark for audio-centric conversational recommendation that links authentic user conversations from Reddit with corresponding tracks. MusiCRS includes 477 high-quality conversations spanning diverse genres (classical, hip-hop, electronic, metal, pop, indie, jazz), with 3,589 unique musical entities and audio grounding via YouTube links. MusiCRS supports evaluation under three input modality configurations: audio-only, query-only, and audio+query, allowing systematic comparison of audio-LLMs, retrieval models, and traditional approaches. Our experiments reveal that current systems struggle with cross-modal integration, with optimal performance frequently occurring in single-modality settings rather than multimodal configurations. This highlights fundamental limitations in cross-modal knowledge integration, as models excel at dialogue semantics but struggle when grounding abstract musical concepts in audio. To facilitate progress, we release the MusiCRS dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/rohan2810/MusiCRS), evaluation code (https://github.com/rohan2810/musiCRS), and comprehensive baselines.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Implicit Neural Network for Binaural Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity binaural audio synthesis is crucial for immersive listening, but existing methods require extensive computational resources, limiting their edge-device application. To address this, we propose the Lightweight Implicit Neural Network (Lite-INN), a novel two-stage framework. Lite-INN first generates initial estimates using a time-domain warping, which is then refined by an Implicit Binaural Corrector (IBC) module. IBC is an implicit neural network that predicts amplitude and phase corrections directly, resulting in a highly compact model architecture. Experimental results show that Lite-INN achieves statistically comparable perceptual quality to the best-performing baseline model while significantly improving computational efficiency. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method (NFS), Lite-INN achieves a 72.7% reduction in parameters and requires significantly fewer compute operations (MACs). This demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the trade-off between synthesis quality and computational efficiency, providing a new solution for high-fidelity edge-device spatial audio applications.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Fourier-based Network for Binaural Speech Enhancement with Spatial Cue Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binaural speech enhancement faces a severe trade-off challenge, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved by computationally intensive architectures, while lightweight solutions often come at the cost of significant performance degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Adaptive Fourier Network (GAF-Net), a lightweight deep complex network that aims to establish a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The GAF-Net architecture consists of three components. First, a dual-feature encoder combining short-time Fourier transform and gammatone features enhances the robustness of acoustic representation. Second, a channel-independent globally adaptive Fourier modulator efficiently captures long-term temporal dependencies while preserving the spatial cues. Finally, a dynamic gating mechanism is implemented to reduce processing artifacts. Experimental results show that GAF-Net achieves competitive performance, particularly in terms of binaural cues (ILD and IPD error) and objective intelligibility (MBSTOI), with fewer parameters and computational cost. These results confirm that GAF-Net provides a feasible way to achieve high-fidelity binaural processing on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Frame-Stacked Local Transformers For Efficient Multi-Codebook Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer (LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.</description>

      <title>Speaker Anonymisation for Speech-based Suicide Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adolescent suicide is a critical global health issue, and speech provides a cost-effective modality for automatic suicide risk detection. Given the vulnerable population, protecting speaker identity is particularly important, as speech itself can reveal personally identifiable information if the data is leaked or maliciously exploited. This work presents the first systematic study of speaker anonymisation for speech-based suicide risk detection. A broad range of anonymisation methods are investigated, including techniques based on traditional signal processing, neural voice conversion, and speech synthesis. A comprehensive evaluation framework is built to assess the trade-off between protecting speaker identity and preserving information essential for suicide risk detection. Results show that combining anonymisation methods that retain complementary information yields detection performance comparable to that of original speech, while achieving protection of speaker identity for vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Direct Speech-to-Text Translation with Speech LLMs: Better Scaling than CoT Prompting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it. CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multimodal Person Recognition: A Robust Framework for Handling Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Person identification systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal person identification framework that utilizes gesture as a situational enhancer to supplement traditional modalities like voice and face. Our model employs a unified hybrid fusion strategy, integrating both feature-level and score-level information to maximize representational richness and decision accuracy. Specifically, it leverages multi-task learning to process modalities independently, followed by cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms. Finally, a confidence-weighted strategy dynamically adapts to missing data, ensuring that our single classification head achieves optimal performance even in unimodal and bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark in this work for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed trimodal system achieves 99.51% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in bimodal mode, outperforming conventional approaches. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.</description>
