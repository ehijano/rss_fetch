      <title>cuRPQ: A High-Performance GPU-Based Framework for Processing Regular and Conjunctive Regular Path Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular path queries (RPQs) are fundamental for path-constrained reachability analysis, and more complex variants such as conjunctive regular path queries (CRPQs) are increasingly used in graph analytics. Evaluating these queries is computationally expensive, but to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored GPU acceleration. In this paper, we propose cuRPQ, a high-performance GPU-optimized framework for processing RPQs and CRPQs. cuRPQ addresses the key GPU challenges through a novel traversal algorithm, an efficient visited-set management scheme, and a concurrent exploration-materialization strategy. Extensive experiments show that cuRPQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by orders of magnitude, without out-of-memory errors.</description>

      <title>RISK: Efficiently processing rich spatial-keyword queries on encrypted geo-textual data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) for geo-textual data has attracted significant attention. However, existing schemes rely on task-specific, incompatible indices for isolated specific secure queries (e.g., range or k-nearest neighbor spatial-keyword queries), limiting practicality due to prohibitive multi-index overhead. To address this, we propose RISK, a model for rich spatial-keyword queries on encrypted geo-textual data. In a textual-first-then-spatial manner, RISK is built on a novel k-nearest neighbor quadtree (kQ-tree) that embeds representative and regional nearest neighbors, with the kQ-tree further encrypted using standard cryptographic tools (e.g., keyed hash functions and symmetric encryption). Overall, RISK seamlessly supports both secure range and k-nearest neighbor queries, is provably secure under IND-CKA2 model, and extensible to multi-party scenarios and dynamic updates. Experiments on three real-world and one synthetic datasets show that RISK outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 0.5 and 4 orders of magnitude in response time for 1% range queries and 10-nearest neighbor queries, respectively.</description>

      <title>CaDrift: A Time-dependent Causal Generator of Drifting Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents Causal Drift Generator (CaDrift), a time-dependent synthetic data generator framework based on Structural Causal Models (SCMs). The framework produces a virtually infinite combination of data streams with controlled shift events and time-dependent data, making it a tool to evaluate methods under evolving data. CaDrift synthesizes various distributional and covariate shifts by drifting mapping functions of the SCM, which change underlying cause-and-effect relationships between features and the target. In addition, CaDrift models occasional perturbations by leveraging interventions in causal modeling. Experimental results show that, after distributional shift events, the accuracy of classifiers tends to drop, followed by a gradual retrieval, confirming the generator's effectiveness in simulating shifts. The framework has been made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Data Agents: Emerging Paradigm or Overstated Hype?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents, autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning proactive, generative data agents.</description>

      <title>The Golden Path to Guarded Monotone Strict NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01254v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guarded Monotone Strict NP (GMSNP) extends Monotone Monadic Strict NP (MMSNP) by guarded existentially quantified predicates of arbitrary arities. We prove that the containment and the FO-rewritability problems for GMSNP are decidable, thereby settling an open question of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, later restated by Bourhis and Lutz. Our proof also comes with a 2NEXPTIME upper bound on the complexity of the two problems, which matches the lower bounds for MMSNP due to Bourhis and Lutz. To obtain these results, we significantly improve the state of knowledge of the model-theoretic properties of GMSNP. Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke previously showed that every GMSNP sentence defines a finite union of CSPs of $\omega$-categorical structures. We show that these structures can be used to obtain a reduction from the containment problem for GMSNP to the much simpler problem of testing the existence of a recolouring; a careful analysis of this yields said upper bound for containment. The upper bound for FO-rewritability is subsequently obtained by an application of several standard techniques from the theory of infinite-domain CSPs. As our secondary contribution, we refine the construction of Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke by adding a restricted form of homogeneity to the properties of these structures, making the logic amenable to future complexity classifications for query evaluation using techniques developed for infinite-domain CSPs.</description>

      <title>GPM: The Gaussian Pancake Mechanism for Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for preserving individual privacy in data analysis. However, an implicit yet fundamental assumption underlying these rigorous privacy guarantees is the correct implementation and execution of DP mechanisms. Several incidents of unintended privacy loss have occurred due to numerical issues and inappropriate configurations of DP software, which have been successfully exploited in privacy attacks. To better understand the seriousness of defective DP software, we ask the following question: is it possible to elevate these passive defects into active privacy attacks while maintaining covertness?
  To address this question, we present the Gaussian pancake mechanism (GPM), a novel mechanism that is computationally indistinguishable from the widely used Gaussian mechanism (GM), yet exhibits arbitrarily weaker statistical DP guarantees. This unprecedented separation enables a new class of backdoor attacks: by indistinguishably passing off as the authentic GM, GPM can covertly degrade statistical privacy. Unlike the unintentional privacy loss caused by GM's numerical issues, GPM is an adversarial yet undetectable backdoor attack against data privacy. We formally prove GPM's covertness, characterize its statistical leakage, and demonstrate a concrete distinguishing attack that can achieve near-perfect success rates under suitable parameter choices, both theoretically and empirically.
  Our results underscore the importance of using transparent, open-source DP libraries and highlight the need for rigorous scrutiny and formal verification of DP implementations to prevent subtle, undetectable privacy compromises in real-world systems.</description>
