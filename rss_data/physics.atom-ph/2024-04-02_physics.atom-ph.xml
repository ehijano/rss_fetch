      <title>Prospects of nuclear-coupled-dark-matter detection via correlation spectroscopy of I$_2^+$ and Ca$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) and its interaction with the Standard Model (SM) is one of the biggest open questions in physics nowadays. The vast majority of theoretically-motivated Ultralight-DM (ULDM) models predict that ULDM couples dominantly to the SM strong/nuclear sector. This coupling leads to oscillations of nuclear parameters that are detectable by comparing clocks with different sensitivities to these nature's constants. Vibrational transitions of molecular clocks are more sensitive to a change in the nuclear parameters than the electronic transitions of atomic clocks. Here, we propose the iodine molecular ion, I$_2^+$, as a sensitive detector for such a class of ULDM models. The iodine's dense spectrum allows us to match its transition frequency to that of an optical atomic clock (Ca$^+$) and perform correlation spectroscopy between the two clock species. With this technique, we project a few-orders-of-magnitude improvement over the most sensitive clock comparisons performed to date. We also briefly consider the robustness of the corresponding "Earth-bound" under modifications of the $Z_N$-QCD axion model.</description>

      <title>Long-range dipole-dipole exchange-induced atomic grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for dipole exchange-induced grating (DEIG) based on a hybrid system consisting of ultra-cold Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) atomic ensemble and movable Rydberg spin atoms. The optical response of the grating appears as a superposition of three- and four-level configurations, similar to the cooperative optical nonlinear effect caused by the dipole blockade effect. However, such Rydberg atomic grating uniquely responds to the spatial positions of spin atoms, offering a novel approach to dynamically control electromagnetically induced gratings (EIG) except for input probe intensity.</description>

      <title>Detangling the quantum tapestry of intra-channel interference in below-threshold nonsequential double ionization with few-cycle laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of single-channel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with few-cycle pulses, using the strong-field approximation. We focus on a below-threshold intensity for which the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism is prevalent. We derive and classify several analytic interference conditions for single-channel RESI in arbitrary driving fields, and address specific issues for few-cycle pulses. Since the cycles in a short pulse are no longer equivalent, there are several events whose dominance varies. We quantify this dominance for single excitation channels by proposing a dominance parameter. Moreover, there will be many more types of superimposed interference fringes that must be taken into consideration. We find an intricate tapestry of patterns arising from phase differences related to symmetrization, temporal shifts and a combination of exchange and event interference.</description>

      <title>Measurement of three-body recombination coefficient of ultracold lithium and strontium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of a conspicuous loss in an ultracold mixture of $^{7}$Li and $^{88}$Sr atoms confined in a far-off-resonance optical dipole trap. We attribute the trap loss to the three-body inelastic Li-Sr-Sr collision and extract the corresponding three-body recombination coefficient $K_3$ at $T\sim 18.5,45,70,600$ $\mu K$. The measured three-body recombination coefficient is about two to three orders of magnitude larger than the typical values convenient for realizing quantum degenerate gases. It also indicates a potentially large $s$-wave scattering length between the bosonic $^{7}$Li and $^{88}$Sr atoms, and essentially rules out the prospect of realizing $^7$Li and $^{88}$Sr mixtures of high phase space density.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the systematic error induced by quadratic Zeeman effect using hyperfine ground state exchange method in a long-baseline dual-species atom interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic error induced by the quadratic Zeeman effect is non-negligible in atom interferometers and must be precisely evaluated. We theoretically analyze the phase shift induced by the Zeeman effect, and use a hyperfine ground state exchange (HGSE) method to evaluate the systematic error in the long-baseline $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb dual-species atom interferometer due to the quadratic Zeeman effect. Compared to the two evaluation methods, mapping the absolute magnetic field in the interference region and performing phase measurements at different bias fields, the HGSE method could obtain the systematic error in real time in case of slow drifts of either the ambient magnetic field or other systematic effects irrelevant to the hyperfine ground states. To validate the effectiveness of the HGSE method, we also employ the mapping magnetic field method and modulating bias field method independently to cross-check and yield consistent results of three methods within an accuracy of $10^{-11}$ level. The HGSE method is helpful in evaluating and suppressing the quadratic Zeeman-effect-induced systematic error in long-baseline atom interferometer-based precision measurements, such as equivalence principle tests.</description>

      <title>Phase Matching of High-Order Harmonics in Hollow Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the case of phase-matched high-harmonic generation in a gas-filled capillary waveguide, comparing in detail theory with experiment. We observe three different regimes of phase matching: one where atomic dispersion balances waveguide dispersion, another corresponding to non-collinear Cerenkov phase-matching, and a third where atomic dispersion and plasma dispersion balance. The role of atomic dispersion is demonstrated by studying the dependence of the harmonic signal for several gases. We also predict and provide preliminary evidence of a regime where phase-matching occurs only at specific fractional ionization levels, leading to an output signal that is sensitive to the absolute phase of the carrier wave.</description>

      <title>Phase-Matching of High-Order Harmonics Driven by Mid- Infrared Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that phase-matched frequency upconversion of ultrafast laser light can be extended to shorter wavelengths by using longer driving laser wavelengths. Experimentally, we show that the phase-matching cutoff for harmonic generation in argon increases from 45 to 100 eV when the driving laser wavelength is increased from 0.8 to 1.3 micrometers. Phase matching is also obtained at higher pressures using a longer-wavelength driving laser, mitigating the unfavorable scaling of the single-atom response. Theoretical calculations suggest that phase-matched high harmonic frequency upconversion driven by mid-infrared pulses could be extended to extremely high photon energies.</description>

      <title>Imaging a Chain of Rydberg Superatoms Enabled by F\"{o}rster-Resonance-Enhanced Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate single-shot and \textit{in situ} absorption imaging of individual Rydberg superatoms. This level of resolution is achieved using an electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg superatoms due to F\"{o}rster-resonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements illustrate the existence of the F\"{o}rster resonance and underscore the state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3 $\mu$s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg superatoms excited in a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg superatoms. This imaging technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Kapitza-Dirac effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to the optical diffraction of light passing through a material grating, the Kapitza-Dirac effect occurs when an electron is diffracted by a standing light wave. In its original description the effect is time-independent. In the present work, we extend the Kapitza-Dirac concept to the time domain. By tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of a pulsed electron wave packet diffracted by a femtosecond (10 15 second) standing wave pulse in a pump-probe scheme, we observe so far unseen time-dependent diffraction patterns. The fringe spacing in the observed pattern differs from that generated by the conventional Kapitza-Dirac effect, moreover it decreases as the pump-probe delay time increases. By exploiting this time-resolved diffraction scheme, we gather access to the time evolution of the previously inaccessible phase properties of a free electron.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven breakdown of Aharonov--Bohm caging in flat-band Rydberg lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands play a central role in hosting emergent states of matter in many condensed matter systems, from the nascent insulating states of twisted bilayer graphene to the fractionalized excitations found in frustrated magnets and quantum Hall materials. Here, we report on the experimental realization of highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. Using the approach of synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries, and through nonequilibrium dynamics we explore the control of Aharonov--Bohm (AB) caging via a tunable $U(1)$ gauge field. Through microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs, we explore the interaction-driven breakdown of AB caging in the limit of strong dipolar interactions that mix the lattice bands. In the limit of weak interactions, where caging remains intact, we observe an effective magnetism that arises due to the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These observations of strongly correlated flat-band dynamics open the door to explorations of new emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent dynamics of interacting quantum particles plays a central role in the study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the pursuit of quantum information processors. Here, we present the state-space of interacting Rydberg atoms as a synthetic landscape on which to control and observe coherent and correlated dynamics. With full control of the coupling strengths and energy offsets between the pairs of sites in a nine-site synthetic lattice, we realize quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and dynamics in an Escher-type ``continuous staircase". In the interacting regime, we observe correlated quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and confinement of particle pairs. Additionally, we simultaneously tilt our lattice both up and down to achieve coherent pair oscillations. This work establishes synthetic Rydberg lattices of interacting atom arrays as a promising platform for programmable quantum many-body dynamics with access to features that are difficult to realize in real-space lattices.</description>

      <title>Influence of atomic modeling on electron capture and shaking processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing experimental efforts to measure with unprecedented precision electron-capture probabilities challenges the current theoretical models. The short range of the weak interaction necessitates an accurate description of the atomic structure down to the nucleus region. A recent electron-capture modeling has been modified in order to test the influence of three different atomic descriptions on the decay and shaking probabilities. To this end, a specific atomic modeling was developed in the framework of the relativistic density-functional theory, exploring several exchange-correlation functionals and self-interaction-corrected models. It was found that the probabilities of total shaking, tested on both photoionization and electron-capture processes, depend strongly on the accuracy of the atomic modeling. Predictions of capture probabilities have been compared with experimental values evaluated from available published data for different radionuclides from $^{7}$Be to $^{138}$La. New high-precision measurements are strongly encouraged because the accuracy of the current experimental values is insufficient to test the models beyond the inner shells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the radiance properties of a pair of qubits inside a single-mode cavity driven by a two-photon drive. Our results show that, when the two qubits are strongly coupled to the cavity field, the collective radiation emitted from the qubits exhibits hyperradiance which can be detected as a signature of two qubit entanglement in the weak-driving regime. We quantify the entanglement in terms of concurrence. Additionally, we study the radiance behaviour in the presence of an intracavity Kerr-nonlinear medium that leads to two-photon blockade. Our results suggest that this system with nonlinearity may act as a quadrature-squeezed and hyperradiant two-photon source.</description>

Abstract: We present the design and characterization of individual addressing optics based on a multi-channel acousto-optic modulator (AOM) for trapped ytterbium-171 ions. The design parameters of the individual addressing system were determined based on the tradeoff between the expected crosstalk and the required numerical aperture of the projection objective lens. The target beam diameter and separation were 1.90 $\mu$m and 4.28 $\mu$m, respectively. The individual beams shaped by the projection optics were characterized by an imaging sensor and a field probe ion. The resulting effective beam diameters and separations were approximately 2.34--2.36 $\mu$m and 4.31 $\mu$m, respectively, owing to residual aberration.</description>
