      <title>The Impact and Influence of Academic Genealogies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an academic genealogy, or AG, and illustrate how AG charts may be constructed and then demonstrate how this methodology can be used by applying it to create the partial or full AG charts to two scientists, Paul A. Samuelson and Ronald E. Mickens.</description>

      <title>The Journey from Planck Distribution to Bose Statistics From Classical to Quantum Mechanics and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose's pioneering work laid the foundation for Bose-Einstein statistics, which describes particles with integral spins. His derivation of Planck's law for blackbody radiation bypassed classical assumptions, relying instead on the statistical mechanics of light quanta. Bose's methodology addressed limitations in existing theories, such as Einstein's dependence on classical concepts like Wien's displacement law and Bohr's correspondence principle. Further, his work underscored the incompatibility between classical electrodynamics and quantum theory, proposing innovative statistical approaches to thermodynamic equilibrium. The insights from Bose's work extend beyond theoretical physics. As was immediately noticed by Einstein, for temperatures below a critical threshold, Bose-Einstein statistics predicts the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where particles condense en-masse into the ground state. This quantum phenomenon on a macroscopic scale opened avenues to explore new technologies in recent times, apart from throwing light on new phases of matter. This article revisits Bose's groundbreaking contributions, highlighting their enduring impact on quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and field theory.</description>

      <title>Self-consciousness and personal identity in quantum panprotopsychism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous papers, we demonstrated that an ontology of quantum mechanics, described in terms of states and events with internal phenomenal aspects (a form of panprotopsychism), is well suited to explain consciousness. We showed that the combination problems of qualities, structures and subjects in panpsychism and panprotopsychism stem from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics regarding supervenience, which are not applicable at the quantum level. Within this view, consciousness arises in entangled quantum systems coupled to the neural network of the brain. In entangled systems, the properties of individual parts disappear, giving rise to an exponential number of emergent properties and states. Here, we analyze self-consciousness as the capacity to view oneself as a subject of experience. The causal openness of quantum systems provides self-conscious beings the ability to make independent choices and decisions, reflecting a sense of self-governance and autonomy. In this context, the issue of personal identity takes a new form free from the problems of the simple view or the reductive approaches.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e on Gibbs and on Probability in Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews a paper from 1906 by J. Henri Poincar\'e on statistical mechanics with a background in his earlier work and notable connections to J. Willard Gibbs. Poincar\'e's paper presents important ideas that are still relevant for understanding the need for probability in statistical mechanics. Poincar\'e understands the foundations of statistical mechanics as a many-body problem in analytical mechanics (reflecting his 1890 monograph on The Three-Body Problem and the Equations of Dynamics) and possibly influenced by Gibbs independent development published in chapters in his 1902 book, Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics. This dynamical systems approach of Poincar\'e and Gibbs provides great flexibility including applications to many systems besides gasses. This foundation benefits from close connections to Poincar\'e's earlier work. Notably, Poincar\'e had shown (e.g. in his study of non-linear oscillators) that Hamiltonian dynamical systems display sensitivity to initial conditions separating stable and unstable trajectories. In the first context it precludes proving the stability of orbits in the solar system, here it compels the use of ensembles of systems for which the probability is ontic and frequentist and does not have an a priori value. Poincar\'e's key concepts relating to uncertain initial conditions, and fine- and coarse-grained entropy are presented for the readers' consideration. Poincar\'e and Gibbs clearly both wanted to say something about irreversibility, but came up short.</description>

      <title>What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism? On How to Avoid Holes in Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a mathematically foundational level, our most successful physical theories (gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories) are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question, then, is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories, making their conceptual structure more transparent: it formally implements the point-coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.</description>
