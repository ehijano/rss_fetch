      <title>Spin Bott Indices For Time-Reversal-Invariant Higher-Order Topological Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of bulk and boundary topologies in higher-order topological phases offer remarkable tunability and diversity to boundary states but also pose a challenge to their unified topological characterization. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant topological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner states by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and boundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in arbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of MKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele model with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this representative model, various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge cleavage, and despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can be faithfully characterized by the proposed topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Absence of BCS-BEC Crossover in FeSe0.45Te0 55 Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductor Fe(Se,Te), a flat band-like feature near the Fermi level was observed around the Brillouin zone center in the superconducting state. It is under debate whether this is the evidence on the presence of the BCS-BEC crossover in the superconductor. High-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements are carried out on high quality single crystals of FeSe0.45Te0.55 superconductor to address the issue. By employing different polarization geometries, we have resolved and isolated the dyz band and the topological surface band, making it possible to study their superconducting behaviors separately. The dyz band alone does not form a flat band-like feature in the superconducting state and the measured dispersion can be well described by the BCS picture. We find that the flat band-like feature is formed from the combination of the dyz band and the topological surface state band in the superconducting state. These results reveal the origin of the flat band-like feature and rule out the presence of BCS-BEC crossover in Fe(Se,Te) superconductor.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the vortex ratchet effect in superconductor open nanotubes and nanopetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in the fabrication of superconducting 3D nanostructures, along with the creation of artificial pinning sites, pave the way to novel applications and enhancement of nanosensors, bolometers, and quantum interferometers. The dynamics of magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) in 3D nanoarchitectures reveal a rich palette of phenomena unseen in planar counterparts. Here, we consider two types of superconductor 3D nanostructures -- open nanotubes and nanopetals -- carrying an azimuthal transport current in a homogeneous external magnetic field. The complex 3D geometry of the structures induces an inhomogeneity of the magnetic field and makes the vortices to move along preferred paths. By introducing a lattice of asymmetric pinning sites along these paths, we realize a non-reciprocal flux transport and study a vortex ratchet effect, which is revealed to be stronger than in the respective planar (unrolled) membranes. The enhancement of the vortex ratchet effect becomes apparent via a factor-of-two difference in the depinning current under the current reversal, and it is attributed to the inhomogeneous-field-induced vortex channeling through the areas containing the asymmetric pinning sites. Our results demonstrate that the ratchet efficiency can be enhanced via extending a superconducting film into the third dimension, without increase in the number of asymmetric pinning sites.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Fusion of Majorana Zero Modes in Quantum-dot based Interacting Kitaev Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental realization of a minimal Kitaev chain in quantum dot systems, we present our theoretical findings on the dynamics and
  fusion of MZMs at or near the $``$sweet spot" $t_h = \Delta$ (where the fermionic hopping $t_h$ and superconducting coupling $\Delta$ are equal).
  We investigated the dynamics and fusion of MZMs using time-dependent real-space local density-of-states methods.
  The movement of Majoranas and the detection of fusion channels are crucial for topological quantum computations.
  Additionally, we discuss our recent discovery of exotic $``$multi-site" MZMs in $Y$-shaped Kitaev wires,
  which is important for the potential braiding of Majoranas in $Y$-junctions formed from arrays of quantum dots.
  Finally, we present results on "non-trivial" fusion using canonical Kitaev wires at the sweet spot.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on spin density wave in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in high-pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ has garnered significant attention. Using density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at ambient pressure. Our calculations suggest that with $\delta=0$, the double spin stripe phase is favored as the magnetic ground state. Oxygen vacancies may effectively turn nearest Ni spins into charge sites. Consequently, with moderate $\delta$ values, our theoretical magnetic ground state exhibits characteristics of both double spin stripe and spin-charge stripe configurations, providing a natural explanation to reconcile the seemingly contradictory experimental findings that suggest both the configurations as candidates for the spin-density-wave phase. With higher $\delta$ values, we anticipate the ground state to become a spin-glass-like noncollinear magnetic phase with only short-range order. The oxygen vacancies are expected to significantly impact the magnetic excitations and the transition temperatures $T_{SDW}$. We further offer a plausible explanation for the experimental observations that the measured $T_{SDW}$ appears insensitive to the variation of samples and the lack of direct evidence for long-range magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of a Superconducting Szilard Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a Szilard engine that uses a 2-bit logical unit consisting of coupled quantum flux parametrons -- Josephson-junction superconducting circuits originally designed for quantum computing. Detailed simulations show that it is highly thermodynamically efficient while functioning as a Maxwell demon. The physically-calibrated design is targeted to direct experimental exploration. However, variations in Josephson junction fabrication introduce asymmetries that result in energy inefficiency and low operational fidelity. We provide a design solution that mitigates these practical challenges. The resulting platform is ideally suited to probe the thermodynamic foundations of information processing devices far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Order Parameters in Spin Space Groups: Methodology and Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a systematic approach to construct superconducting order parameters based on the spin space group. Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial and spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting channels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be different. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and show the possible superconducting ground states. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to realistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting gap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While several researchers report counterexamples of the instability, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase is robust against the stacking if it has an additional chiral symmetry, in terms of the level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system. We demonstrate this by mapping a one-dimensional class DIII superconductor with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology to the corresponding non-Hermitian system in AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <title>Local analysis of a single impurity on a graphene Josephson Junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the local effects of a single short-range impurity on the electron system of a short ballistic graphene Josephson Junction. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.</description>

      <title>Suppression of thermal smearing in a feedback-driven atomic size Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultimate spatial limit to establish a Josephson coupling between two superconducting electrodes is an atomic-scale junction. The Josephson effect in such ultrasmall junctions has been used to unveil new switching dynamics, study coupling close to superconducting bound states or unveil non-reciprocal effects. However, coupling is weak and thermal smearing reduces the Cooper pair current magnitude. Here we show that a feedback element induces a time-dependent bistable regime which consists of periodic oscillations between two different Cooper pair tunneling states (corresponding to the DC and AC Josephson regimes respectively). The amplitude of the time-averaged current within the bistable regime is robust against thermal smearing. By tracing the periodic oscillations in the new bistable regime as a function of the position in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), we obtain atomic scale map of the critical current in 2H-NbSe$_2$ and find spatial modulations due to a pair density wave. Our results fundamentally improve our understanding of atomic size Josephson junctions and provide a promising new route to study superconducting materials through atomic scale maps of the Josephson coupling.</description>

      <title>Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin Ovchinnikov state indications via thermodynamic analysis in the isotropic superconductor Ti4Ir2O</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an investigation of the isotropic superconductor Ti4Ir2O, focusing on its magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram near and above the Pauli limit for superconductivity. The data exhibits characteristic features that align with the formation of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, including a deviation of the upper critical field line from the standard WHH model upon approaching the Pauli limiting field and a phase transition line separating the ordinary low-field superconducting phase from an unusual high field superconducting state above the Pauli limit. We discuss why the upper critical field line in this isotropic superconductor can approach the Pauli limit, necessitating a particularly high orbital limit for superconductivity. The research also identifies peculiar features in the specific heat data set taken at 0.6 K, which may be an example of the segmentation of the FFLO phase with multiple q phases. The findings provide an explanation for the violation of the Pauli limit in this superconductor, adding a fully isotropic superconductor to the list of potential FFLO superconductors and providing new insights for contemporary theories of the FFLO state.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the novel type of orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in the bulk limit of 2H-NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03215v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, an unusual superconducting state, defies high magnetic fields beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. It exhibits a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter in real space and is exceptionally rare. Recently, an even more exotic variant - the orbital FFLO state - was predicted and identified in the transition metal dichalcogenide superconductor 2H-NbSe2. This state emerges in thin samples with thicknesses below ~40 nm, at the boundary between two and three dimensions. The complex interplay between Ising spin orbit coupling and the Pauli paramagnetic effect can lead to a stabilization of the FFLO state in a relatively large range of the magnetic phase diagram, even well below the Pauli limit. In this study, we present experimental evidence of the formation of this orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. This evidence was obtained using high-resolution DC magnetization and magnetic torque experiments in magnetic fields applied strictly parallel to the NbSe2 basal plane. Both quantities display a crossover to a discontinuous first-order superconducting transition at the normal state boundary in magnetic fields of 4 T and above. This is usually seen as a sign that Pauli paramagnetic pair breaking effects affect the superconducting state. The magnetic torque reveals a small step-like reversible anomaly, indicating a magnetic field-induced thermodynamic phase transition within the superconducting state. This anomaly bears many similarities to the FFLO transitions in other FFLO superconductors, suggesting the potential existence of an orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. Additionally, we observe a pronounced in-plane 6-fold symmetry of the upper critical field in the field range above this phase transition, which has previously been interpreted as a hallmark of the orbital FFLO state in thin 2H-NbSe2.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall effect from superconducting fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the planar Hall effect (PHE) in two-dimensional (2D) superconductors with spin-orbit interactions, where transport anisotropy is induced by an in-plane magnetic field. While PHE typically arises from the breaking of basal mirror symmetry, when the field exclusively couples to spin degrees of freedom, it remains negligible in non-interacting systems. In this study, we explore anisotropic paraconductivity as an alternative mechanism for PHE observed in 2D superconductors in the normal state. Due to the momentum dependence of spin-orbit interactions, the field-induced pair breaking exhibits anisotropy. To elucidate this phenomenon, we compute the PHE for the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our analysis reveals that Cooper pairs propagating along the field experience stronger pair breaking compared to those moving perpendicular to the field. This physical insight is corroborated by explicit calculations of paraconductivity.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal superconductivity, also known as the superconducting diode effect, has been extensively studied in the presence of a magnetic field or some form of ferromagnetic order breaking time-reversal symmetry. We here show that another class of magnetic order known as altermagnetism, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry but does not exhibit a finite net magnetic moment, can also give rise to a superconducting diode effect. Whether this is the case depends on the combination of the system's point group and altermagnetic order parameter which we explore systematically for two-dimensional crystalline systems. If the superconducting electrons are in a centrosymmetric crystalline environment, an electric field $E_z$ (or other sources of inversion symmetry breaking) can be used to turn on and tune the non-reciprocity, yielding an electric-field tunable diode effect; there are also non-centrosymmetric point groups, which are not reached by applying $E_z \neq 0$ in a centrosymmetric crystal, but still allow for an altermagnetic order parameter with non-reciprocal superconductivity. Depending on the residual magnetic point group, the zeros of the critical current asymmetry, $J_c(\hat{n}) - J_c(-\hat{n})$, are pinned along high-symmetry crystalline directions $\hat{n}=\hat{e}_j$ or are free to rotate in the plane of the system. In some cases, the zeros can be rotated by tuning the electric field $E_z$. We discuss all of these phenomena both on the general level using exact symmetry arguments and more explicitly by constructing and solving minimal lattice models. We provide experimental setups to realize the altermagnetic superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in materials with bulk band inversion such as iron-based topological superconductors or doped topological insulators. We show that the structure of the YSR state spectrum depends on the doping level relative to the chemical potential at which the band-inversion occurs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic coupling and vice versa, which is caused by the coupling of magnetic impurities through the overlap of YSR states, is highly dependent on the doping level. Additionally, topological edge states may have a substantial impact on the YSR states, leading to a decrease in YSR state energies and the creation of new states when the magnetic impurity approaches the boundary.</description>

Abstract: The geometrical properties of a helical ferromagnet are shown theoretically to control the critical temperature of a proximity-coupled superconductor. Using the Usadel equation for diffusive spin transport, we provide self-consistent analysis of how curvature and torsion modulate the proximity effect. When the helix is attached to a piezoelectric actuator, the pitch of the helix -- and hence the superconducting transition -- can be controlled electrically.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of SU(2) gauge theory coupled to four adjoint Higgs fields</title>

Abstract: Gauge theories with matter fields in various representations play an important role in different branches of physics. Recently, it was proposed that several aspects of the interesting pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors near optimal doping may be explained by an emergent $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. Around the transition with positive hole-doping, one can construct a $(2+1)-$dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory coupled to four adjoint scalar fields which gives rise to a rich phase diagram with a myriad of phases having different broken symmetries. We study the phase diagram of this model on the Euclidean lattice using the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the existence of multiple broken phases as predicted by previous mean field studies. Depending on the quartic couplings, the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is broken down either to $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the perturbative description of the model. We further study the confinement-deconfinement transition in this theory, and find that both the broken phases are deconfining in the range of volumes that we studied. However, there exists a marked difference in the behavior of the Polyakov loop between the two phases.</description>
