      <title>Magnetic diffuse scattering of the $S$ = 5/2 fcc antiferromagnets Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$ and Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic diffuse scattering of isostructural $S$ = 5/2 fcc antiferromagnets Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$ and Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$ using polarized neutrons. Both materials display short-range correlated magnetism above their respective magnetic ordering temperatures of 20 K and 8 K. The spin correlations were analysed using a Reverse Monte Carlo approach. For Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$, we find antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor correlations along with ferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor correlations directly linked to the Type I order below $T_N$. For Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$, both the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor spin correlations are antiferromagnetic in the paramagnetic state. The short-range spin correlations persist up to $T$ = 7$T_N$. The magnetic diffuse scattering was also fitted using Onsager reaction-field theory allowing us to evaluate the magnetic interactions in these materials. We obtained $J_1$ = -3.25(3) K and $J_2$ = 0.41(2) K for Ba$_2$MnTeO$_6$ and $J_1$ = -1.08(1) K and $J_2$ = -0.88(1) K for Ba$_2$MnWO$_6$. These interactions are comparable to previous results from inelastic neutron scattering experiments below $T_N$, which highlights the potential of the Onsager approach for the analysis of magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric induced hole dispersion and emergent particle-hole symmetry in topological flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent hole dispersion in flat bands is an invaluable platform to study the interplay of quantum geometry and electron-electron interaction with a relatively simple setting. In this work, we find that the hole dispersion in ideal bands has a linear relationship with the trace of the quantum geometry tensor at every $\boldsymbol{k}$-point for a wide range of interactions to a good approximation. Next, we give a microscopic analysis on the hole dispersion and show that the linear relationships for short-range and long-range interactions in $\boldsymbol{k}$-space have different origins. Moreover, we show how to exploit this observation to engineer particle-hole symmetry in a Chern band with fluctuating quantum geometry. Our results will be useful for further studying the physics in particle-hole symmetric flat bands both in theory and in experiment.</description>

      <title>Spinon spin current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of interlayer electron coherence in a bilayer semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent strongly-correlated electronic phenomena in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides are an exciting frontier in condensed matter physics, with examples ranging from bilayer superconductivity~\cite{zhao2023evidence} and electronic Wigner crystals~\cite{smolenski2021signatures,zhou2021bilayer} to the ongoing quest for exciton condensation~\cite{wang2019evidence,ma2021strongly,shi2022bilayer}. Here, we experimentally investigate the properties of indirect excitons in naturally-grown MoS$_2$-homobilayer, integrated in a dual-gate device structure allowing independent control of the electron density and out-of-plane electric field. Under conditions when electron tunneling between the layers is negligible~\cite{pisoni2019absence}, upon electron doping the sample, we observe that the two excitons with opposing dipoles hybridize, displaying unusual behavior distinct from both conventional level crossing and anti-crossing. We show that these observations can be explained by static random coupling between the excitons, which increases with electron density and decreases with temperature. We argue that this phenomenon is indicative of a spatially fluctuating order parameter in the form of interlayer electron coherence, a theoretically predicted many-body state~\cite{zheng1997exchange} that has yet to be unambiguously established experimentally outside of the quantum Hall regime~\cite{sarma2008perspectives,spielman2000resonantly,kellogg2004vanishing,kellogg2002observation,spielman2001observation,fertig1989energy,shi2022bilayer}. Implications of our findings for future experiments and quantum optics applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties of the dimerized organic conductor $\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$Mn[N(CN)$_2$]$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional molecular conductor $\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$Mn[N(CN)$_2$]$_3$ undergoes a sharp metal-to-insulator phase transition at $T_{\rm MI}\approx$ 21 K, which has been under scrutiny for many years. We have performed comprehensive infrared investigations along the three crystallographic directions as a function of temperature down to 10 K, complemented by electron spin resonance and dc-transport studies. The in-plane anisotropy of the optical conductivity is more pronounced than in any other $\kappa$-type BEDT-TTF or related compounds. The metal-insulator transitions affects the molecular vibrations due to the coupling to the electronic system; in addition we observe a clear splitting of the charge-sensitive vibrational modes below $T_{\rm MI}$ that evidences the presence of two distinct BETS dimers in this compound. The Mn[N(CN)$_2$]$_3^-$ layers are determined by the chain structure of the anions resulting in a rather anisotropic behavior and remarkable temperature dependence of the vibronic features. At low temperatures the ESR properties are affected by the Mn$^{2+}$ ions via $\pi$-$d$-coupling and antiferromagnetic ordering within the $\pi$-spins: The $g$-factor shifts enormously with a pronounced in-plane anisotropy that flips as the temperature decreases; the lines broaden significantly; and the spin susceptibility increases upon cooling with a kink at the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pseudomode Representation and Complexity of Quantum Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium fermionic quantum impurity models (QIM), describing a small interacting system coupled to a continuous fermionic bath, play an important role in condensed matter physics. Solving such models is a computationally demanding task, and a variety of computational approaches are based on finding approximate representations of the bath by a finite number of modes. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding efficient bath representations as that of approximating a kernel of the bath's Feynman-Vernon influence functional by a sum of complex exponentials, with each term defining a fermionic pseudomode. Under mild assumptions on the analytic properties of the bath spectral density, we provide an analytic construction of pseudomodes, and prove that their number scales polylogarithmically with the maximum evolution time $T$ and the approximation error $\varepsilon$. We then demonstrate that the number of pseudomodes can be significantly reduced by an interpolative matrix decomposition (ID). Furthermore, we present a complementary approach, based on constructing rational approximations of the bath's spectral density using the ``AAA'' algorithm, followed by compression with ID. The combination of two approaches yields a pseudomode count scaling as $N_\text{ID} \sim \log(T)\log(1/\varepsilon)$, and the agreement between the two approches suggests that the result is close to optimal. Finally, to relate our findings to QIM, we derive an explicit Liouvillian that describes the time evolution of the combined impurity-pseudomodes system. These results establish bounds on the computational resources required for solving out-of-equilibrium QIMs, providing an efficient starting point for tensor-network methods for QIMs.</description>

      <title>Insights from the exact analytical solution of periodically driven transverse field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact analytical expression, at stroboscopic intervals, for the time-dependent wave function of a class of integrable quantum many-body systems, driven by the periodic delta-kick protocol. To investigate long-time dynamics, we use the wave-function to obtain an exact analytical expression for the expectation value of defect density, magnetization, residual energy, fidelity, and correlation function after the $n$th drive cycle. Periodically driven integrable closed quantum systems absorb energy, and the long-time universal dynamics are described by the periodic generalized Gibbs ensemble(GGE). We demonstrate that the expectation values of all observables are divided into two parts: one highly oscillatory term that depends on the drive cycle $n$, and the rest of the terms are independent of it. Typically, the $n$-independent part constitutes the saturation at large $n$ and periodic GGE. The contribution from the highly oscillatory term vanishes in large $n$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of the three-dimensional doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the phase diagram of the Hubbard model on a cubic lattice for a wide range of temperatures, dopings and interaction strengths, considering both commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders. We use the dynamical mean-field theory together with an efficient method to compute the free energy which enable the determination of the correct ordering vectors. Besides an antiferromagnetic state close to half-filling, we identify a number of different magnetic spiral phases with ordering vectors $(q,\pi,\pi)$, $(q,q,\pi)$ and $(q,q,q)$ as well as a region with close competition between them, hinting at spatial phase separation or at the onset of a stripe phase. Additionally, we extensively study several thermodynamic properties with direct relevance to cold-atom experiments: the entropy, energy and double-occupancy.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for anisotropic magnetic interaction in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ from polarized inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized neutron scattering experiments reveal the anisotropy of magnetic correlations in the candidate Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The anisotropy of the inelastic response at the magnetic Bragg positions is just opposite to the expectation for a simple Heisenberg model. Near the antiferromagnetic $q$ vector, there are no low-energy transversal magnon modes directly documenting the fully anisotropic and bond-directional character of the magnetic interaction in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, other findings disagree with a simple or strongly dominant Kitaev component.</description>

      <title>Unraveling pairon excitations and the antiferromagnetic contributions in the cuprate specific heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal measurements, such as the entropy and the specific heat, reveal key elementary excitations for understanding the cuprates. In this paper, we study the specific heat measurements on three different compounds La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and show that the data are compatible with `pairons' and their excitations. However, the precise fits require the contribution of the antiferromagnetic entropy deduced from the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$.
  Two temperature scales are involved in the excitations above the critical temperature $T_c$: the pseudogap $T^*$, related to pairon excitations, and the magnetic correlation temperature, $T_{max}$, having very different dependencies on the carrier density ($p$). In agreement with our previous analysis of $\chi(T)$, the $T_{max}(p)$ line is not the signature of a gap in the electronic density of states, but is rather the temperature scale of strong local antiferromagnetic correlations which dominate for low carrier concentration. These progressively evolve into paramagnetic fluctuations in the overdoped limit.
  Our results are in striking contradiction with the model of J. L. Tallon and J. G. Storey [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 107}, 054507 (2023)], who reaffirm the idea of a $T$-independent gap $E_g$, whose temperature scale $T_g=E_g/k_B$ decreases linearly with $p$ and vanishes at a critical value $p_c \sim 0.19$.
  Finally, we discuss the unconventional fluctuation regime above $T_c$, which is associated with a mini-gap $\delta\sim$ 2\,meV in the pairon excitation spectrum. This energy scale is fundamental to the condensation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories, the discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories, have become an important platform for the exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena beyond their original scope in the Standard Model. In particular, recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model including its spectral properties, the structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing, double-logarithmic-in-time, growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to an approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that the entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results thus suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within the numerically accessible system sizes.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based qudit quantum refrigerator with subspace cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to transform a collection of higher-dimensional spin systems from the thermal state with a very high temperature of a local spin-s Hamiltonian to a low-lying energy eigenstate of the same. The procedure utilizes an auxiliary system, interactions between all systems, and appropriate projective measurements of arbitrary rank performed on the auxiliary system. We refer to this process as subspace cooling. The performance of the protocol is assessed by determining the fidelity of the target state with the output one and the success probability of achieving the resulting state. For this analysis, spin-s XXZ and bilinear biquadratic models are employed as the evolving Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that in both scenarios, unit fidelity can be attained after a reasonable number of repeated measurements and a finite amount of evolution time when all the systems are aligned in an open chain, but it fails when the interactions between the spin follow the star configuration. We report that the success probability increases with the rank of the projectors in the measurement for a fixed dimension and that for each dimension, there exists a range of interaction strength and evolution period for which the fidelity gets maximized. Even when some subsystems are in contact with the thermal bath, the method proves to be resistant to decoherence.</description>

      <title>Simulating a quasiparticle on a quantum device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to explore quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems, motivated by the potential in leveraging near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices for quantum state preparation. By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. We show that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically non-trivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We show that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Topological gauge theory of vortices in type-III superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional superconductors fall into two categories, type-I, expelling magnetic fields, and type-II, into which magnetic fields exceeding a lower critical field $H_{\rm c1}$ penetrate in form of Abrikosov vortices. Abrikosov vortices are characterized by two spatial scales, the size of the normal core, $\xi$, where the superconducting order parameter is suppressed and the London penetration depth $\lambda$, describing the scale at which circulating superconducting currents forming vortices start to noticeably drop. Here we demonstrate that a novel type-III superconductivity, realized in granular media in any dimension hosts a novel vortex physics. Type-III vortices have no cores, are logarithmically confined and carry only a gauge scale $\lambda$. Accordingly, in type-III superconductors $H_{\rm c1}=0$ at zero temperature and the Ginzburg-Landau theory must be replaced by a topological gauge theory. Type-III superconductivity is destroyed not by Cooper pair breaking but by vortex proliferation generalizing the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism to any dimension.</description>

      <title>Doping the Mott insulating state of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model reveals the Sordi transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been reported that upon doping a Mott insulator, there can be a crossover to a pseudogaped metallic phase followed by a first-order transition to another thermodynamically stable metallic phase. We call this first-order metal-metal transition the Sordi transition. It was argued that the initial reports of Sordi transitions at finite temperature could be explained by finite size effects and biases related to the model and method used. In this work, we report the Sordi transition on larger clusters at finite temperature on a triangular lattice, where long-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations are frustrated, using a different method, the dynamical cluster approximation instead of the cellular dynamical mean-field theory. This demonstrates that this first-order transition is a directly observable transition in doped Mott insulators and that it is relevant for experiments on candidate spin-liquid organic materials.</description>

      <title>Two $T$-linear scattering rate regimes in the triangular lattice Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the $T$-linear scattering rate found at low temperatures, defining the strange metal phase of cuprates, has been a subject of interest. Since a wide range of materials have a scattering rate that obeys the equation $ \hbar / \tau \approx k_B T$, the idea of a universal Planckian limit on the scattering rate has been proposed. However, there is no consensus on proposed theories yet. In this work, we present our results for the $T$-linear scattering rate in the triangular lattice Hubbard model obtained using the dynamical cluster approximation. We find two regions with $T$-linear scattering rate in the $T$ -- $p$ phase diagram: one emerges from the pseudogap to correlated Fermi liquid phase transition at low doping, whereas the other is solely caused by large interaction strength at large doping.</description>

Abstract: Demonstrating the non-Abelian Ising anyon statistics of Majorana zero modes in a physical platform still represents a major open challenge in physics. We here show that the linear low-frequency charge conductance of a Majorana interferometer containing a floating superconducting island can reveal the topological spin of quantum edge vortices. The latter are associated with chiral Majorana fermion edge modes and represent "flying" Ising anyons. We describe possible device implementations and outline how to detect non-Abelian anyon braiding through AC conductance measurements.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dipole Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$: magnetoelectricity and contact-free signatures of topological transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover an intrinsic dipole Hall effect in a variety of magnetic insulating states at integer fillings of twisted MoTe$_2$ moir\'e superlattice, including topologically trivial and nontrivial ferro-, antiferro-, and ferri-magnetic configurations. The dipole Hall current, in linear response to in-plane electric field, generates an in-plane orbital magnetization $M_{\parallel}$ along the field, through which an AC field can drive magnetization oscillation up to THz range. Upon the continuous topological phase transitions from trivial to quantum anomalous Hall states in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, the dipole Hall current and $M_{\parallel}$ have an abrupt sign change, enabling contact free detection of the transitions through the magnetic stray field. In configurations where the linear response is forbidden by symmetry, the dipole Hall current and $M_{\parallel}$ appear as a crossed nonlinear response to both in-plane and out-of-plane electric fields. These magnetoelectric phenomena showcase novel functionalities of insulators from the interplay between magnetism, topology and electrical polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractonic matter can undergo unconventional phase transitions driven by the condensation of particles that move along subdimensional manifolds. We propose that this type of quantum critical point can be realized in a bilayer of crossed Rydberg chains. This system exhibits a transition between a disordered phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive ground state degeneracy. We show that this transition is described by a stack of critical Ising conformal field theories that become decoupled in the low-energy limit due to emergent subsystem symmetries. We also analyze the transition using a Majorana mean-field approach for an effective lattice model, which confirms the picture of a fixed point of decoupled critical chains. We discuss the unusual scaling properties and derive anisotropic correlators that provide signatures of subdimensional criticality in this realistic setup.</description>

      <title>Critical properties of metallic and deconfined quantum phase transitions in Dirac systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize, by means of large-scale fermion quantum Monte Carlo simulations, metallic and deconfined quantum phase transitions in a bilayer honeycomb model in terms of their quantum critical and finite-temperature properties.The model features three different phases at zero temperature as function of interaction strength. At weak interaction, a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal state is realized. At intermediate and strong interaction, respectively, two long-range-ordered phases that break different symmetries are stabilized. The ordered phases feature partial and full, respectively, gap openings in the fermion spectrum. The first transition between the disordered and long-range-ordered semimetallic phases has previously been argued to be described by the $(2+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu-SO(3) field theory. By performing simulations with an improved symmetric Trotter decomposition, we further substantiate this claim by computing the critical exponents $1/\nu$, $\eta_\phi$, and $\eta_\psi$, which turn out to be consistent with the field-theoretical expectation within numerical and analytical uncertainties. The second transition between the two long-range-ordered phases has previously been proposed as a possible instance of a metallic deconfined quantum critical point. We further develop this scenario by analyzing the spectral functions in the single-particle, particle-hole, and particle-particle channels. Our results indicate gapless excitations with a unique velocity, supporting the emergence of Lorentz symmetry at criticality. We also compute the finite-temperature phase boundaries of the ordered states above the fully gapped state at large interaction. The phase boundaries vanishes smoothly in the vicinity of the putative metallic deconfined quantum critical point, in agreement with the expectation for a continuous or weakly-first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Obstruction to Broken Symmetries in Topological Flat Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the abundance of symmetry breaking states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and other two-dimensional materials, we study superconducting (SC) and charge orders in two-dimensional topological flat bands in the strong correlation regime. By relating the half-filled 2D topological flat bands to the surface states of 3D topological insulators in symmetry class AIII, we reveal the topological obstruction to the formation of gapped SC and inter-valley charge orders without intrinsic topological orders, in the presence of the anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry at half filling. This is a generalization of the Li-Haldane arguments for nodal superconductivity to strongly interacting electrons. In contrast to the $\mathbb{Z}$-valued obstruction derived from the non-interacting band topology, the topological obstruction of interacting electrons in half-filled flat bands has a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ classification, depending on the charge (valley) Chern number of the superconducting (inter-valley charge) orders. This is demonstrated by an interacting Hamiltonian for half-filled flat bands with a net Chern number $C=4$, where superconductivity and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order coexist in a gapped ground state with particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum metallic state marked by a saturating finite electrical resistance in the zero-temperature limit in a variety of two-dimensional superconductors injects an exciting momentum to the realm of heterostructure superconductivity. Despite much research efforts over last few decades, there is not yet a general consensus on the nature of this unexpected quantum metal. Here, we report the observation of a unique quantum metallic state within the hallmark of Bose-metal in the titanium sesquioxide heterointerface superconductor Ti$_2$O$_3$/GaN. Remarkably, the quantum bosonic metallic state continuously tuned by a magnetic field in the vicinity of the two-dimensional superconductivity-metal transition persists in the normal phase, indicating the existence of composite bosons formed by electron Cooper pairs even in the normal phase. Our findings provide a distinct evidence for electron pairing in the normal phase of heterointerface superconductors, and shed fresh light on the pairing nature underlying heterointerface superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) has been proposed to enable and protect topological order in all eigenstates, vastly expanding the traditional ground-state setting. However, for the most intriguing case of two-dimensional (2D) systems with anyons and topology-dependent degeneracies, the dense many-body spectrum challenges studying this MBL protection numerically. Here we use large-scale full-spectrum variational ans\"atze to demonstrate MBL-protected topological order in the disordered 2D toric code perturbed by magnetic fields. We show that the system has topological local integrals of motion (tLIOMs) for magnetic field strengths below $h_c\approx0.1$ times the toric code coupling scale. Combining tLIOMs with exact diagonalization, we also identify high-energy topological multiplets in the dense many-body spectrum. The phase diagram we find is consistent with toric-code and trivial MBL phases being separated by an intervening thermal phase.</description>

Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis yields the NMEs $4.34^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $^{136}$Xe and $5.51^{+0.24}_{-0.26}$ for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using trial wavefunctions prepared on quantum devices to reduce the bias of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) has established itself as a promising hybrid approach to the simulation of strongly correlated many body systems. Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing the trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated by classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection formalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the recently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation in QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method outperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy computations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the original number of qubits.</description>
