      <title>Black hole spin-down via cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. As a result, the spins of primordial black holes should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <title>Not all lensing is low: An analysis of DESI$\times$DES using the Lagrangian Effective Theory of LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we use Lagrangian perturbation theory to analyze the harmonic space galaxy clustering signal of Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) targeted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with the galaxy--galaxy lensing signal measured around these galaxies using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 source galaxies. The BGS and LRG galaxies are extremely well characterized by DESI spectroscopy and, as a result, lens galaxy redshift uncertainty and photometric systematics contribute negligibly to the error budget of our ``$2\times2$-point'' analysis. On the modeling side, this work represents the first application of the \texttt{spinosaurus} code, implementing an effective field theory model for galaxy intrinsic alignments, and we additionally introduce a new scheme (\texttt{MAIAR}) for marginalizing over the large uncertainties in the redshift evolution of the intrinsic alignment signal. Furthermore, this is the first application of a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) model for galaxy bias based on the $\texttt{Aemulus}\, \nu$ simulations. Our main result is a measurement of the amplitude of the lensing signal, $S_8=\sigma_8 \left(\Omega_m/0.3\right)^{0.5} = 0.850^{+0.042}_{-0.050}$, consistent with values of this parameter derived from the primary CMB. This constraint is artificially improved by a factor of $51\%$ if we assume a more standard, but restrictive parameterization for the redshift evolution and sample dependence of the intrinsic alignment signal, and $63\%$ if we additionally assume the nonlinear alignment model. We show that when fixing the cosmological model to the best-fit values from Planck PR4 there is $&gt; 5 \sigma$ evidence for a deviation of the evolution of the intrinsic alignment signal from the functional form that is usually assumed in cosmic shear and galaxy--galaxy lensing studies.</description>

      <title>The need to refine the standard recombination theory and the Hubble tension problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, cosmology has become largely based on experimental data, the most important sources of which are studies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). CMB is present in the Universe since the very first moments of its existence, and the features of CMB recorded now reflect the fundamental processes of the evolution of the Universe. These processes cause a weak anisotropy of CMB, which is no more than 0.01 percent. The structure of anisotropy, which is interpreted on the basis of a sufficiently detailed standard theory of primary recombination, allows us to establish the most important cosmological parameters. One of these parameters is the Hubble constant (more precisely, the Hubble parameter). However, the difference between the value of the Hubble constant, obtained from the results of the Planck mission, and obtained from independent local measurements, is 10%. Such a big difference is called the Hubble tension problem, and is an important problem of cosmology. The interpretation of the Planck measurements (as well as the interpretation of WMAP results, where a close value of the Hubble constant is obtained) is critically based on the predictions of the standard recombination theory. This work shows that the recombination rate is higher than predicted by standard theory and is caused by the excitation of the kinetic degrees of freedom of hydrogen atoms, which is ignored by standard theory. The calculations performed demonstrate that taking into account this process leads to a good coincidence of the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the results of the Planck experiment and local measurements.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from local features of the inflaton potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can form in the early Universe from peaks of the primordial curvature perturbations. The statistics of the peaks determines the abundance of PBHs, and is related to the amplitude of the primordial curvature spectrum. We study single field inflationary models with local features of the inflaton potential which induce a growth of curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales, which can increase the spectrum, and consequently the predicted PBHs abundance. We compute the effects of the different parameters of the features on the PBHs abundance, giving some example of models compatible with observational constraints. The mechanism is general, and can induce the PBH production in diffent mass ranges by appropriately tuning the parameters, and we give a specific example producing PBHs with abundance compatible with asteroid mass constraints.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and radio quasars through model-independent methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a cosmological-model-independent test on the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) obtained from the compact radio quasars (QSOs) with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift, and three different parameterizations are adopted to quantify the possible deviations from the CDDR. We initially investigate the impacts of the specific prior values for the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa and the linear size scaling factor $l$ from QSOs on the CDDR test, demonstrating that these prior values introduce significant biases in the CDDR test. To avoid the biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $l$ to test CDDR, which treats the fiducial value of a new variable $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\,l$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalize its impact with a flat prior in the statistical analysis. We demonstrate that the parametric method for testing CDDR can not only be used to reduce the computational complexity associated with numerical integration but also be independent of cosmological models. The results indicate that the CDDR is consistent with the observational data, and QSOs can serve as a powerful tool for testing the CDDR.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Energy Evolution Post-DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evidence for dark energy (DE) evolution at low redshift, using baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) from the DESI Early Data Release, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SNe-Ia), and redshift space distortions (RSDs) to constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we make use of the angular acoustic scale to analyse the effect of introducing condensed CMB information on the cosmological parameters informing DE evolution. The analysis is divided into cases based on the variability of priors inferred from early-time physics. Using a quadratic parametrisation, $X(z)$, for DE density, we find evidence for DE evolution in all cases, both with and without the angular acoustic scale. We reconstruct $X(z)$ using best fit parameters and find that DE density starts to exhibit dynamical behaviour at $z \sim 0.5 $, assuming negative values beyond $z\sim 1.5$. The data show no significant preference for $X(z)$CDM over a $\Lambda$CDM, with both models performing equally well according to our chosen metrics of reduced $\chi^2$ and the Durbin-Watson statistic.</description>

      <title>Joint observations of late universe probes: cosmological parameter constraints from gravitational wave and Type Ia supernova data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing tensions between the early Universe and the late Universe increasingly highlight the importance of developing precise probes for late cosmology. As significant late-Universe probes, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and gravitational waves (GWs) can provide measurements of relative and absolute distances, respectively. Their complementary nature is likely to break the degeneracies among cosmological parameters, thereby yielding more precise constraints. In this study, we use 43 gravitational-wave sources from the Third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and 1590 SNe Ia from Pantheon+ compilation to constrain the dark energy models, as an attempt to achieve precise late-Universe cosmological constraints. For the dark siren GW event, we estimate the corresponding redshift using the binary black hole redshift distribution model. The combination of GW and SNe Ia data could provide the precision on the Hubble constant (H0) and the present matter density (Omega_m) of approximately 20% and 8% for the LambdaCDM model. If we consider the equation of state of dark energy (w), the combination sample constrains the precision of w to approximately 30%. Although the combination of GW and SNe Ia observations effectively breaks degeneracies among various cosmological parameters, yielding more stringent constraints, the precision of these constraints still does not meet the stringent standards required by precision cosmology. However, it is reasonable to anticipate that, in the near future, the joint observations of GWs and SNe Ia will become a powerful tool, particularly in the late Universe, for the precise measurement of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>A generalized method of constraining Warm Inflation with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough MCMC analysis of any inflationary model against the current cosmological data is essential for assessing the validity of such a model as a viable inflationary model. Warm Inflation, producing both thermal and quantum fluctuations, yield a complex form of scalar power spectrum, which, in general, cannot be directly written as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$, an essential step to incorporate the primordial spectra into CAMB to do an MCMC analysis through CosmoMC/Cobaya. In this paper, we devised an efficient generalized methodology to mould the WI power spectra as a function of $k$, without the need of slow-roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics. The methodology is directly applicable to any Warm Inflation model, including the ones with complex forms of the dissipative coefficient and the inflaton potential.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Ultraviolet Tail of the Primordial Gravitational Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with wave numbers larger than the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation are originated from the ultraviolet (UV) modes, which are never stretched out of the horizon. Such a UV tail of the PGW energy spectrum has a spurious logarithmic divergence. We study the origin of such a divergence, and find that it comes from the instantaneous inflation-to-post-inflation transition, which can be removed by considering a finite duration. For the first time, we obtain a semi-analytical expression for the PGW energy spectrum. We find that the UV tail decays exponentially, while the decay rate depends solely on the transition rate. When there is a stiff post-inflationary stage, the enhanced PGW displays a characteristic spectral shape of power-law increasing and exponential decaying. We propose a fitting formula which can be used for signal searching.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Neutrino Masses: Insights from Robust (e)BOSS Data Analysis and Prospects for DESI and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings from DESI BAO, combined with Planck CMB data, have set an upper limit on the total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072 \, \text{eV}$ (95% confidence level). This rules out the minimum sum for the inverted hierarchy, and interestingly, the most likely value for the total neutrino mass is actually zero. Indeed, methods that rely on the background expansion of the Universe tend to suggest negative neutrino masses. In this work, we contribute to the quest for accurately constraining neutrino mass using cosmological probes. By conducting a full-shape analysis of data from BOSS, eBOSS, and synthetic power spectra, we discovered that constraints on neutrino mass can be significantly influenced by projection effects from the Bayesian marginalization process, rendering these constraints largely unreliable. Our results highlight the need for better techniques to accurately measure the neutrino mass. Based on the large-scale structure suppression, we identified a critical blind spot in the full-shape analysis. By splitting the galaxy power spectrum into broadband and wiggles, we noticed that information on neutrino mass is primarily extracted from the suppressed wiggles rather than broadband suppression. This opens the possibility of developing alternative methods based only on the wiggles of the power spectrum that can be more robust compared to those heavily reliant on background evolution.</description>

      <title>Phasing out of Darkness: From Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter to Neutrino Masses via Time-Dependent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are a compelling candidate for generating neutrino masses and for elucidating the nature of dark matter. Astrophysical X-ray constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter decays, however, largely exclude the active-sterile mixing required to produce simultaneously the correct left-handed neutrino spectrum and keV-scale right-handed neutrino dark matter within a type-I seesaw framework. In this study, we demonstrate how these X-ray constraints can be circumvented through a time-dependent approach, thereby reviving a broad range of active-sterile mixing scenarios. Our minimal model incorporates two right-handed neutrinos, which form a two-component dark matter candidate, and an auxiliary scalar field that experiences a very late and still ongoing phase transition, leading to the spontaneous breaking of a global $ U(1)_N $ symmetry. Prior to this phase transition, only the right-handed neutrinos are massive, while the left-handed neutrinos remain massless because of the scalar field's vanishing expectation value. As the phase transition develops, the growing expectation value of the scalar field increases the active-sterile mixing, thereby opening dark matter decay channels and inducing neutrino masses. The time dependence allows the scenario to be consistent with X-ray constraints as well as current measurements of left-handed neutrino masses. The anticipated level of active-sterile mixing today is within the detection capabilities of the forthcoming TRISTAN (KATRIN) tritium-beta decay project. Additionally, cosmological surveys such as DESI or EUCLID and supernova neutrino observations can test the prediction of massless left-handed neutrinos prior to the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Helicity-changing Decays of Cosmological Relic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the possibility that massive neutrinos are unstable due to their invisible decays $\nu^{}_i \to \nu^{}_j + \phi$, where $\nu^{}_i$ and $\nu^{}_j$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$) are any two of neutrino mass eigenstates with masses $m^{}_i &gt; m^{}_j$ and $\phi$ is a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson, and explore the implications for the detection of cosmological relic neutrinos in the present Universe. First, we carry out a complete calculation of neutrino decay rates in the general case where the individual helicities of parent and daughter neutrinos are specified. Then, the invisible decays of cosmological relic neutrinos are studied and their impact on the capture rates on the beta-decaying nuclei (e.g., $\nu^{}_e + {^3{\rm H}} \to {^3{\rm He}} + e^-$) is analyzed. The invisible decays of massive neutrinos could substantially change the capture rates in the PTOLEMY-like experiments when compared to the case of stable neutrinos. In particular, we find that the helicity-changing decays of Dirac neutrinos play an important role whereas those of Majorana neutrinos have no practical effects.</description>

      <title>Chameleon Mechanism in Scalar Nonmetricity Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and the phase-space evolution for the scalar nonmetricity cosmology with a Chameleon mechanism. In particular, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker geometry and within the framework of scalar nonmetricity theory, we consider a generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory in nonmetricity gravity. Introducing a pressureless gas as the matter source, we also incorporate a coupling function responsible for the interaction. Our findings reveal that the choice of connection in nonmetricity gravity significantly impacts the interaction between the scalar field and the matter source. For one particular connection, we discover the absence of asymptotic solutions with a nontrivial interacting component. More precisely, in this scenario, the matter source does not directly interact with the scalar field; however, there is an interaction with the dynamical degrees of freedom provided by the connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All of the significant evidence for dark matter observed thus far has been through its gravitational interactions. After 40 years of direct detection experiments, the parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) as dark matter candidates is rapidly approaching the neutrino floor. In this light, we consider a dark sector that is strongly decoupled from the visible sector, interacting exclusively through gravity. In this model, proposed by Freese and Winkler (arXiv:2302.11579), dark matter can be produced through a first-order phase transition in the dark sector dubbed the Dark Big Bang. In this study we fully determine the allowed region of parameter space for the tunneling potential that leads to the realization of a Dark Big Bang and is consistent with all experimental bounds available.</description>

Abstract: The dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber is presently one of the leading technologies to search for dark matter particles with masses below 10 GeV/c$^2$. This was demonstrated by the DarkSide-50 experiment with approximately 50 kg of low-radioactivity liquid argon as target material. The next generation experiment DarkSide-20k, currently under construction, will use 1,000 times more argon and is expected to start operation in 2027. Based on the DarkSide-50 experience, here we assess the DarkSide-20k sensitivity to models predicting light dark matter particles, including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and sub-GeV/c$^2$ particles interacting with electrons in argon atoms. With one year of data, a sensitivity improvement to dark matter interaction cross-sections by at least one order of magnitude with respect to DarkSide-50 is expected for all these models. A sensitivity to WIMP--nucleon interaction cross-sections below $1\times10^{-42}$ cm$^2$ is achievable for WIMP masses above 800 MeV/c$^2$. With 10 years exposure, the neutrino fog can be reached for WIMP masses around 5 GeV/c$^2$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Non-minimally Coupled Scalar Fields in the Jordan Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of scalar fields with non-minimal gravitational interactions of the form $\xi |\phi|^2 R$ may have important implications for the physics of the early universe. While many studies solve the dynamics of non-minimally coupled scalars in the Einstein frame, where gravity is simply described by the Einstein-Hilbert action, we instead propose a procedure to solve the dynamics directly in the original Jordan frame where the non-minimal couplings are maintained explicitly. Our algorithm can be applied to scenarios that include minimally coupled fields and an arbitrary number of non-minimally coupled scalars, with the expansion of the universe sourced by all fields present. This includes situations when the dynamics become fully inhomogeneous, fully non-linear (due to e.g.~backreaction or mode rescattering effects), and/or when the expansion of the universe is dominated by non-minimally coupled species. As an example, we study geometric preheating with a non-minimally coupled scalar spectator field when the inflaton oscillates following the end of inflation. In the future, our technique may be used to shed light on aspects of the equivalence of the Jordan and Einstein frames at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the dark energy scalar field potential by Gaussian process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark energy is believed to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe. In this paper, we reconstruct the dark energy scalar field potential $V(\phi)$ using the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ through Gaussian Process analysis. Our goal is to investigate dark energy using various $H(z)$ datasets and priors. We find that the selection of prior and the $H(z)$ dataset significantly affects the reconstructed $V(\phi)$. And we compare two models, Power Law and Free Field, to the reconstructed $V(\phi)$ by computing the reduced chi-square. The results suggest that the models are generally in agreement with the reconstructed potential within a $3\sigma$ confidence interval, except in the case of Observational $H(z)$ data (OHD) with the Planck 18 (P18) prior. Additionally, we simulate $H(z)$ data to measure the effect of increasing the number of data points on the accuracy of reconstructed $V(\phi)$. We find that doubling the number of $H(z)$ data points can improve the accuracy rate of reconstructed $V(\phi)$ by 5$\%$ to 30$\%$.</description>

      <title>Features in the Inflaton Potential and the Spectrum of Cosmological Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations, originating in the quantum fluctuations of the fields that drive inflation, are observed to be nearly scale invariant at the largest scales. At smaller scales, however, perturbations are not severely constrained and might be of particular importance if their amplitude is large. They can trigger the creation of primordial black holes (PBHs) or stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Small-scale perturbations are generated during the later stages of inflation, when possible strong features in the inflaton potential can break scale invariance and leave characteristic imprints on the spectrum. We focus on and review three types of features: inflection points and steep steps in the potential, as well as sharp turns in the inflationary trajectory in field space. We show that such features induce a strong enhancement of the curvature spectrum within a certain wavenumber range. In particular cases, they also generate characteristic oscillatory patterns that are transferred in the spectrum of secondary GWs, which are potentially observable by operating or designed experiments. We demonstrate these effects through the calculation of the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance in the context of $\alpha$-attractors and supergravity (SUGRA) models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic magnification in beyond-Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic magnification is able to probe the geometry of large scale structure on cosmological scales, thereby providing another window for probing theories of the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. It holds the potential to reveal new information on the nature of dark energy and modified gravity. By using the angular power spectrum, with all known relativistic corrections incorporated, we investigated cosmic magnification in beyond-Horndeski gravity. We probed both the total relativistic signal, and the individual relativistic signals. Our results suggest that surveys at low redshifts ($z \,{\lesssim}\, 0.5$) will be able to measure directly the total relativistic signal in the total magnification angular power spectrum without the need for multi-tracer analysis (to beat down cosmic variance). Similarly, for the Doppler signal, our results indicate that it can also be measured directly at the given low redshifts. However, for the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the (gravitational) potential signals, respectively, it will require going to high redshifts ($z \,{\gtrsim}\, 3$) for the signals to surpass cosmic variance. For actual detectability though, proper quantitative methods and error analysis (not considered in this work) will need to be taken into account, i.e. in addition to cosmic variance. We also found that the beyond-Horndeski gravity boosts relativistic effects; consequently, cosmic magnification. Conversely, relativistic effects enhance the potential of the total magnification angular power spectrum to detect the imprint of beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW), arising from large amplitude primordial density fluctuations, provide a unique observational test for directly probing the epoch of inflation. In this work, we provide constraints on the SIGW background by taking into account the non-Gaussianity in the primordial density fluctuations, using the third observing run (O3) data of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We find that the non-Gaussianity gives a non-negligible effect on the GW energy density spectrum and starts to affect the analysis of the O3 data when the non-Gaussianity parameter is $F_{\rm NL} &gt; 3.55$. Furthermore, the constraints exhibit asymptotic behavior given by $F_{\rm NL} A_g = \rm{const.}$ at large $F_{\rm NL}$ limit, where $A_g$ denotes the amplitude of the curvature perturbations. In the limit of large $F_{\rm NL}$, we placed a 95% confidence level upper limit $F_{\rm NL} A_g \leq 0.13, 0.09, 0.10$ at fixed scales of $10^{16}, 10^{16.5}, 10^{17}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Estimation of line-of-sight velocities of individual galaxies using neural networks I. Modelling redshift-space distortions at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the line-of-sight velocities of individual galaxies from an observed redshift-space galaxy distribution. We find an estimate of the peculiar velocity at a galaxy based on galaxy counts and barycenters in shells around it. By training the network with environmental characteristics, such as the total mass and mass center within each shell surrounding every galaxy in redshift space, our ANN model can accurately predict the line-of-sight velocity of each individual galaxy. When this velocity is used to eliminate the RSD effect, the two-point correlation function (TPCF) in real space can be recovered with an accuracy better than 1% at $s$ &gt; 8 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, and 4% on all scales compared to ground truth. The real-space power spectrum can be recovered within 3% on $k$&lt; 0.5 $\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}h$, and less than 5% for all $k$ modes. The quadrupole moment of the TPCF or power spectrum is almost zero down to $s$ = 10 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ or all $k$ modes, indicating an effective correction of the spatial anisotropy caused by the RSD effect. We demonstrate that on large scales, without additional training with new data, our network is adaptable to different galaxy formation models, different cosmological models, and mock galaxy samples at high redshifts and high biases, achieving less than 10% error for scales greater than 15 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. As it is sensitive to large-scale densities, it does not manage to remove Fingers of God in large clusters, but works remarkably well at recovering real-space galaxy positions elsewhere. Our scheme provides a novel way to predict the peculiar velocity of individual galaxies, to eliminate the RSD effect directly in future large galaxy surveys, and to reconstruct the 3-D cosmic velocity field accurately.</description>

Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Archetype-Based Redshift Estimation for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient galaxy archetype-based redshift estimation and spectral classification method for the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) survey. The DESI survey currently relies on a redshift fitter and spectral classifier using a linear combination of PCA-derived templates, which is very efficient in processing large volumes of DESI spectra within a short time frame. However, this method occasionally yields unphysical model fits for galaxies and fails to adequately absorb calibration errors that may still be occasionally visible in the reduced spectra. Our proposed approach improves upon this existing method by refitting the spectra with carefully generated physical galaxy archetypes combined with additional terms designed to absorb data reduction defects and provide more physical models to the DESI spectra. We test our method on an extensive dataset derived from the survey validation (SV) and Year 1 (Y1) data of DESI. Our findings indicate that the new method delivers marginally better redshift success for SV tiles while reducing catastrophic redshift failure by $10-30\%$. At the same time, results from millions of targets from the main survey show that our model has relatively higher redshift success and purity rates ($0.5-0.8\%$ higher) for galaxy targets while having similar success for QSOs. These improvements also demonstrate that the main DESI redshift pipeline is generally robust. Additionally, it reduces the false positive redshift estimation by $5-40\%$ for sky fibers. We also discuss the generic nature of our method and how it can be extended to other large spectroscopic surveys, along with possible future improvements.</description>

      <title>Direct Optimal Mapping Image Power Spectrum and its Window Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key to detecting neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR) is to separate the cosmological signal from the dominating foreground radiation. We developed direct optimal mapping (DOM) to map interferometric visibilities; it contains only linear operations, with full knowledge of point spread functions from visibilities to images. Here, we demonstrate a fast Fourier transform-based image power spectrum and its window functions computed from the DOM images. We use noiseless simulation, based on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array Phase I configuration, to study the image power spectrum properties. The window functions show $&lt;10^{-11}$ of the integrated power leaks from the foreground-dominated region into the EoR window; the 2D and 1D power spectra also verify the separation between the foregrounds and the EoR.</description>

      <title>$H_0$ tension as a manifestation of the time evolution of gravity coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the time evolution of non minimal gravity coupling can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension. The non minimal coupling induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the low redshift variation of the coupling can can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift observations are not affected. Since effective field theory (EFT) in unitary gauge predicts the non minimal coupling to be only a function of time, tests of the equivalence principle are insensitive to it, if experiments are performed in regions of space-time where the time scale of the coupling time evolution is much larger than the experiment time scale. The effects of a time varying non minimal gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

      <title>Can we identify primordial black holes? Tidal tests for subsolar-mass gravitational-wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as one of the smoking gun signatures of a population of primordial black holes~(PBHs). We critically assess whether these systems could be distinguished from stellar binaries, for example composed of white dwarfs or neutron stars, which could also populate the subsolar mass range. At variance with PBHs, the gravitational-wave signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which dramatically grow for moderately compact stars as those expected in the subsolar range. We forecast the capability of constraining tidal effects of putative subsolar neutron star binaries with current and future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivities as well as next-generation experiments. We show that, should LVK O4 run observe subsolar neutron-star mergers, it could measure the (large) tidal effects with high significance. In particular, for subsolar neutron-star binaries, O4 and O5 projected sensitivities would allow measuring the effect of tidal disruption on the waveform in a large portion of the parameter space, also constraining the tidal deformability at ${\cal O}(10\%)$ level, thus excluding a primordial origin of the binary. Vice versa, for subsolar PBH binaries, model-agnostic upper bounds on the tidal deformability can rule out neutron stars or more exotic competitors. Assuming events similar to the subthreshold candidate SSM200308 reported in LVK O3b data are PBH binaries, O4 projected sensitivity would allow ruling out the presence of neutron-star tidal effects at $\approx 3 \sigma$ C.L., thus strengthening the PBH hypothesis. Future experiments would lead to even stronger ($&gt;5\sigma$) conclusions on potential discoveries of this kind.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation and Dark Sector from 11D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori with a general genus and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the FRW universe with four extended spacetime dimensions and seven extremely small compactified spatial dimensions emerges as a solution for the 11D supergravity. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forty years ago, Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit both the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe and the many phenomenological implications of their existence. Most of the paper discusses the limits on their mass distribution and a possible and simple scheme for their production. Finally, we discuss the most promising techniques to detect this type of objects.</description>

      <title>No smooth spacetime: Exploring primordial perturbations in Lorentzian quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of quantum cosmology has focused on the Lorentzian path integral formulations of both the no-boundary and tunneling proposals. However, it has been criticized that the wave function for linearized perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background leads to an inverse Gaussian distribution. This results in divergent correlation functions and cosmological inconsistencies. In this paper we explore these perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology, focusing in particular on the quantum creation of closed, flat, and open universes from no spacetime and the beginning of primordial inflation. We show that most quantum cosmological scenarios have serious perturbation problems. We also study the effects of trans-Planckian physics on quantum cosmology, using the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion as a case study of modified dispersion relations. Our findings indicate that resolving perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology with modified dispersion relations remains a challenge. However, the perturbations can be Gaussian in the quantum creation of the flat or open universe within the confines of the saddle-point approximation and the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion.</description>

      <title>Constraining the physical properties of gas in high-z galaxies with far-infrared and submillimetre line ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical emission line diagnostics, which are a common tool to constrain the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, become progressively inaccessible at higher redshifts for ground-based facilities. Far-infrared (FIR) emission lines, which are redshifted into atmospheric windows accessible by ground-based sub-millimeter facilities, could provide alternative ISM diagnostics to optical emission lines. We investigate FIR line ratios involving [CII]$\lambda 158 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 52 \mu$m, [NII]$\lambda 122 \mu$m and [NIII$\lambda 57 \mu$m, using synthetic emission lines applied to a high-resolution (m$_{\rm gas}$= 883.4 M$_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation, including radiative-transfer post processing with KramsesRT at z = 6.5. We find that the [CII]/[NII]122 ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density of photo-dissociation regions, and thus could be a useful tool to trace the properties of this gas phase in galaxies. We also find that [NII]/[NIII] is a good tracer of the temperature and [OIII]52/[OIII]88 a good tracer of the gas density of HII regions. Emission line ratios containing the [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m line are sensitive to high velocity outflowing gas.</description>

      <title>Early Galaxies and Early Dark Energy: A Unified Solution to the Hubble Tension and Puzzles of Massive Bright Galaxies revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a large population of ultra-violet (UV)-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ and possibly overly massive galaxies at $z\gtrsim 7$, challenging standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use an empirical galaxy formation model to explore the potential of alleviating these tensions through an Early Dark Energy (EDE) model, originally proposed to solve the Hubble tension. Our benchmark model demonstrates excellent agreement with the UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) at $4\lesssim z \lesssim10$ in both $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. In the EDE cosmology, the UVLF measurements at $z\simeq 12$ based on spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit no tension with the benchmark model. Photometric constraints at $12 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$ can be fully explained within EDE via either moderately increased star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon_{\ast}\sim 3-10\%$ at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) or enhanced UV variabilities ($\sigma_{\rm UV}\sim 0.8-1.3$ mag at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) that are within the scatter of hydrodynamical simulation predictions. A similar agreement is difficult to achieve in $\Lambda$CDM, especially at $z\gtrsim 14$, where the required $\sigma_{\rm UV}$ exceeds the maximum value seen in simulations. Furthermore, the implausibly large cosmic stellar mass densities inferred from some JWST observations are no longer in tension with cosmology when the EDE is considered. Our findings highlight EDE as an intriguing unified solution to a fundamental problem in cosmology and the recent tensions raised by JWST observations. Data at the highest redshifts reached by JWST ($z \sim 14-16$) will be crucial for differentiating modified galaxy formation physics from new cosmological physics.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Higgs potential is very likely to be metastable, in which case Higgs Inflation is likely to require an extension in order to stabilise the potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$: $T$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, 2/3)$ and $B$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, -1/3)$. Requiring stability of the finite-temperature effective potential, and assuming $m_{t}$ equals its mean value, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The corresponding absolute stability upper bounds are 4.4 TeV and 29 TeV. Small upper bounds are obtained for $B$ quarks. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger constraint on $m_{Q}$, with the $T$ quark upper bound equal to 2.4 TeV for $n_{Q} = 2$ and 13 TeV for $n_{Q} = 3$. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of ringdown with excitation factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation formalism, the gravitational waveform is obtained by the convolution of the Green's function and the source term causing radiation emission. Hence, the ringdown properties, namely its start time, depend on both functions. The unknown time-shift encoded in the Green's function introduces a "time-shift problem" for ringdown. We study the ringdown time-shift problem by reconstructing a waveform via the excitation factors of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a spinning black hole. For the first time, we reconstruct ringdown with a significant number of QNMs weighted with their excitation factors and confirm its excellent convergence. We then precisely identify the ringdown starting time. We also find (i) that for moderate or large spins and $\ell=m=2$, QNMs should be included up to around the $20$th prograde overtones and around fifth retrograde overtones to reconstruct the ringdown waveform for the delta-function source with a mismatch threshold $ M &lt; O(10^{-3})$. For higher angular modes, a more significant number of QNMs are necessary to reconstruct it; (ii) that the time shift of ringdown caused by the Green's function is the same for different $(\ell, m, n)$ modes but that nontrivial sources can change this conclusion. Finally, we demonstrate (iii) that the greybody factor can be reconstructed with the superposed QNM spectrum in the frequency domain.</description>
