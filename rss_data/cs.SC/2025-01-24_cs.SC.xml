      <title>Projecting dynamical systems via a support bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polynomial dynamical system, we study the problem of computing the minimal differential equation satisfied by a chosen coordinate (in other words, projecting the system on the coordinate). This problem can be viewed as a special case of the general elimination problem for systems of differential equations and appears in applications to modeling and control.
  We give a bound for the Newton polytope of such minimal equation and show that our bound is sharp in "more than half of the cases". We further use this bound to design an algorithm for computing the minimal equation following the evaluation-interpolation paradigm. We demonstrate that our implementation of the algorithm can tackle problems which are out of reach for the state-of-the-art software for differential elimination.</description>

      <title>A Complexity Map of Probabilistic Reasoning for Neurosymbolic Classification Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is a growing field of research aiming to combine neural network learning capabilities with the reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. Informed multi-label classification is a sub-field of neurosymbolic AI which studies how to leverage prior knowledge to improve neural classification systems. Recently, a family of neurosymbolic techniques for informed classification based on probabilistic reasoning has gained significant traction. Unfortunately, depending on the language used to represent prior knowledge, solving certain probabilistic reasoning problems can become prohibitively hard when the number of classes increases. Therefore, the asymptotic complexity of probabilistic reasoning is of cardinal importance to assess the scalability of such techniques. In this paper, we develop a unified formalism for four probabilistic reasoning problems. Then, we compile several known and new tractability results into a single complexity map of probabilistic reasoning. We build on top of this complexity map to characterize the domains of scalability of several techniques. We hope this work will help neurosymbolic AI practitioners navigate the scalability landscape of probabilistic neurosymbolic techniques.</description>
