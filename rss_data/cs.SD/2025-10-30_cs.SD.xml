      <title>A Parameter-Efficient Multi-Scale Convolutional Adapter for Synthetic Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent synthetic speech detection models typically adapt a pre-trained SSL model via finetuning, which is computationally demanding. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative. However, existing methods lack the specific inductive biases required to model the multi-scale temporal artifacts characteristic of spoofed audio. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Convolutional Adapter (MultiConvAdapter), a parameter-efficient architecture designed to address this limitation. MultiConvAdapter integrates parallel convolutional modules within the SSL encoder, facilitating the simultaneous learning of discriminative features across multiple temporal resolutions, capturing both short-term artifacts and long-term distortions. With only $3.17$M trainable parameters ($1\%$ of the SSL backbone), MultiConvAdapter substantially reduces the computational burden of adaptation. Evaluations on five public datasets, demonstrate that MultiConvAdapter achieves superior performance compared to full fine-tuning and established PEFT methods.</description>

      <title>Joint Analysis of Acoustic Scenes and Sound Events Based on Semi-Supervised Training of Sound Events With Partial Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annotating time boundaries of sound events is labor-intensive, limiting the scalability of strongly supervised learning in audio detection. To reduce annotation costs, weakly-supervised learning with only clip-level labels has been widely adopted. As an alternative, partial label learning offers a cost-effective approach, where a set of possible labels is provided instead of exact weak annotations. However, partial label learning for audio analysis remains largely unexplored. Motivated by the observation that acoustic scenes provide contextual information for constructing a set of possible sound events, we utilize acoustic scene information to construct partial labels of sound events. On the basis of this idea, in this paper, we propose a multitask learning framework that jointly performs acoustic scene classification and sound event detection with partial labels of sound events. While reducing annotation costs, weakly-supervised and partial label learning often suffer from decreased detection performance due to lacking the precise event set and their temporal annotations. To better balance between annotation cost and detection performance, we also explore a semi-supervised framework that leverages both strong and partial labels. Moreover, to refine partial labels and achieve better model training, we propose a label refinement method based on self-distillation for the proposed approach with partial labels.</description>

      <title>SFMS-ALR: Script-First Multilingual Speech Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis (code-switching TTS) remains a major challenge due to abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched prosody between languages. Conventional TTS systems are typically monolingual and fail to produce natural, intelligible speech in mixed-language contexts. We introduce Script-First Multilingual Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution (SFMS-ALR), an engine-agnostic framework for fluent, real-time code-switched speech generation. SFMS-ALR segments input text by Unicode script, applies adaptive language identification to determine each segment's language and locale, and normalizes prosody using sentiment-aware adjustments to preserve expressive continuity across languages. The algorithm generates a unified SSML representation with appropriate "lang" or "voice" spans and synthesizes the utterance in a single TTS request. Unlike end-to-end multilingual models, SFMS-ALR requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices from Google, Apple, Amazon, and other providers. Comparative analysis with data-driven pipelines such as Unicom and Mask LID demonstrates SFMS-ALR's flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability. The framework establishes a modular baseline for high-quality, engine-independent multilingual TTS and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility, naturalness, and user preference.</description>

      <title>Studies for : A Human-AI Co-Creative Sound Artwork Using a Real-time Multi-channel Sound Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of AI technologies into the artistic workflow through the creation of Studies for, a generative sound installation developed in collaboration with sound artist Evala (https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/archive/works/studies-for/). The installation employs SpecMaskGIT, a lightweight yet high-quality sound generation AI model, to generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an immersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The work is grounded in the concept of a "new form of archive," which aims to preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past artworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a dataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks.
  By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study highlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating artist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3) ensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model was designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new, previously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of "a new form of archive." We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for effectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound art that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence.

      <title>Controlling Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning with Knowledge-Driven Multiple Hypothesis: Application to Beat Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambiguities in data and problem constraints can lead to diverse, equally plausible outcomes for a machine learning task. In beat and downbeat tracking, for instance, different listeners may adopt various rhythmic interpretations, none of which would necessarily be incorrect. To address this, we propose a contrastive self-supervised pre-training approach that leverages multiple hypotheses about possible positive samples in the data. Our model is trained to learn representations compatible with different such hypotheses, which are selected with a knowledge-based scoring function to retain the most plausible ones. When fine-tuned on labeled data, our model outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks, showcasing the advantages of integrating domain knowledge with multi-hypothesis selection in music representation learning in particular.</description>

      <title>Binaspect -- A Python Library for Binaural Audio Analysis, Visualization &amp; Feature Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Binaspect, an open-source Python library for binaural audio analysis, visualization, and feature generation. Binaspect generates interpretable "azimuth maps" by calculating modified interaural time and level difference spectrograms, and clustering those time-frequency (TF) bins into stable time-azimuth histogram representations. This allows multiple active sources to appear as distinct azimuthal clusters, while degradations manifest as broadened, diffused, or shifted distributions. Crucially, Binaspect operates blindly on audio, requiring no prior knowledge of head models. These visualizations enable researchers and engineers to observe how binaural cues are degraded by codec and renderer design choices, among other downstream processes. We demonstrate the tool on bitrate ladders, ambisonic rendering, and VBAP source positioning, where degradations are clearly revealed. In addition to their diagnostic value, the proposed representations can be exported as structured features suitable for training machine learning models in quality prediction, spatial audio classification, and other binaural tasks. Binaspect is released under an open-source license with full reproducibility scripts at https://github.com/QxLabIreland/Binaspect.</description>

      <title>Efficient Vocal Source Separation Through Windowed Sink Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art vocal separation models like Mel-Band-Roformer rely on full temporal self-attention mechanisms, where each temporal frame interacts with every other frames. This incurs heavy computational costs that scales quadratically with input audio length, motivating chunking and windowing approaches. Through analysis of a pre-trained vocal separation model, we discovered that temporal attention patterns are highly localized. Building on this insight, we replaced full attention with windowed sink attention (WSA) with small temporal attention window and attention sinks. We show empirically that fine-tuning from the original checkpoint recovers 92% of the original SDR performance while reducing FLOPs by 44.5x. We release our code and checkpoints under MIT license at https://github.com/smulelabs/windowed-roformer.</description>

      <title>Retaining Mixture Representations for Domain Generalized Anomalous Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous sound detection (ASD) in the wild requires robustness to distribution shifts such as unseen low-SNR input mixtures of machine and noise types. State-of-the-art systems extract embeddings from an adapted audio encoder and detect anomalies via nearest-neighbor search, but fine tuning on noisy machine sounds often acts like a denoising objective, suppressing noise and reducing generalization under mismatched mixtures or inconsistent labeling. Training-free systems with frozen self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders avoid this issue and show strong first-shot generalization, yet their performance drops when mixture embeddings deviate from clean-source embeddings. We propose to improve SSL backbones with a retain-not-denoise strategy that better preserves information from mixed sound sources. The approach combines a multi-label audio tagging loss with a mixture alignment loss that aligns student mixture embeddings to convex teacher embeddings of clean and noise inputs. Controlled experiments on stationary, non-stationary, and mismatched noise subsets demonstrate improved robustness under distribution shifts, narrowing the gap toward oracle mixture representations.</description>

      <title>State Space and Self-Attention Collaborative Network with Feature Aggregation for DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.</description>

      <title>Separating peripheral and higher-level effects on speech intelligibility using a hearing loss simulator and an objective intelligibility measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for separating the effects of peripheral hearing loss (HL) and higher-level processes on speech intelligibility (SI). In a previous study, we conducted an SI experiment with 14 older adult (OA) listeners, using speech-in-noise sounds that were either processed with an ideal ratio mask (IRM) enhancement technique or left unprocessed. The current study involved an SI experiment with 15 young, normal-hearing (YNH) listeners. This experiment used simulated HL sounds processed with the WHIS simulator that reflected the hearing level of a specific OA from the previous study. The results showed that the target OA's SI scores were higher than the average YNH scores. This implies that the target OA's higher-level processes may be more effective than those of the average YNH. To understand the characteristics of other OAs, we used the GESI objective intelligibility measure to predict SI. First, we confirmed that GESI could fairly accurately predict the SI scores for both the YNH and OA listeners. Next, we predicted the SI scores of the 14 OA listeners using the parameters estimated in the YNH experiment. The results showed that some OAs had higher SI scores than the average YNH, while one OA had lower scores. These differences in SI scores may reflect variations in the efficiency of higher-level processes.These results imply that WHIS and GESI could facilitate contrastive experiments between YNH and OA listeners, regardless of hearing level. This would allow us to study the effects of higher-level processes in OA listeners individually.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Networks Trained on Noisy Speech Exhibit the McGurk Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans are able to fuse information from both auditory and visual modalities to help with understanding speech. This is demonstrated through a phenomenon known as the McGurk Effect, during which a listener is presented with incongruent auditory and visual speech that fuse together into the percept of illusory intermediate phonemes. Building on a recent framework that proposes how to address developmental 'why' questions using artificial neural networks, we evaluated a set of recent artificial neural networks trained on audiovisual speech by testing them with audiovisually incongruent words designed to elicit the McGurk effect. We show that networks trained entirely on congruent audiovisual speech nevertheless exhibit the McGurk percept. We further investigated 'why' by comparing networks trained on clean speech to those trained on noisy speech, and discovered that training with noisy speech led to a pronounced increase in both visual responses and McGurk responses across all models. Furthermore, we observed that systematically increasing the level of auditory noise during ANN training also increased the amount of audiovisual integration up to a point, but at extreme noise levels, this integration failed to develop. These results suggest that excessive noise exposure during critical periods of audiovisual learning may negatively influence the development of audiovisual speech integration. This work also demonstrates that the McGurk effect reliably emerges untrained from the behaviour of both supervised and unsupervised networks, even networks trained only on congruent speech. This supports the notion that artificial neural networks might be useful models for certain aspects of perception and cognition.</description>

      <title>Application of Whisper in Clinical Practice: the Post-Stroke Speech Assessment during a Naming Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed assessment of language impairment following stroke remains a cognitively complex and clinician-intensive task, limiting timely and scalable diagnosis. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) foundation models offer a promising pathway to augment human evaluation through intelligent systems, but their effectiveness in the context of speech and language impairment remains uncertain. In this study, we evaluate whether Whisper, a state-of-the-art ASR foundation model, can be applied to transcribe and analyze speech from patients with stroke during a commonly used picture-naming task. We assess both verbatim transcription accuracy and the model's ability to support downstream prediction of language function, which has major implications for outcomes after stroke. Our results show that the baseline Whisper model performs poorly on single-word speech utterances. Nevertheless, fine-tuning Whisper significantly improves transcription accuracy (reducing Word Error Rate by 87.72% in healthy speech and 71.22% in speech from patients). Further, learned representations from the model enable accurate prediction of speech quality (average F1 Macro of 0.74 for healthy, 0.75 for patients). However, evaluations on an unseen (TORGO) dataset reveal limited generalizability, highlighting the inability of Whisper to perform zero-shot transcription of single-word utterances on out-of-domain clinical speech and emphasizing the need to adapt models to specific clinical populations. While challenges remain in cross-domain generalization, these findings highlight the potential of foundation models, when appropriately fine-tuned, to advance automated speech and language assessment and rehabilitation for stroke-related impairments.</description>

      <title>Bob's Confetti: Phonetic Memorization Attacks in Music and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI systems for music and video commonly use text-based filters to prevent the regurgitation of copyrighted material. We expose a fundamental flaw in this approach by introducing Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting phonetic memorization. The APT attack replaces iconic lyrics with homophonic but semantically unrelated alternatives (e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"), preserving acoustic structure while altering meaning; we identify high-fidelity phonetic matches using CMU pronouncing dictionary. We demonstrate that leading Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) models like SUNO and YuE regenerate songs with striking melodic and rhythmic similarity to their copyrighted originals when prompted with these altered lyrics. More surprisingly, this vulnerability extends across modalities. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from a song, a Text-to-Video (T2V) model like Veo 3 reconstructs visual scenes from the original music video-including specific settings and character archetypes-despite the absence of any visual cues in the prompt. Our findings reveal that models memorize deep, structural patterns tied to acoustics, not just verbatim text. This phonetic-to-visual leakage represents a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models, rendering simple copyright filters ineffective and raising urgent concerns about the secure deployment of multimodal AI systems. Demo examples are available at our project page (https://jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).</description>

      <title>PromptReverb: Multimodal Room Impulse Response Generation Through Latent Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Room impulse response (RIR) generation remains a critical challenge for creating immersive virtual acoustic environments. Current methods suffer from two fundamental limitations: the scarcity of full-band RIR datasets and the inability of existing models to generate acoustically accurate responses from diverse input modalities. We present PromptReverb, a two-stage generative framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines a variational autoencoder that upsamples band-limited RIRs to full-band quality (48 kHz), and a conditional diffusion transformer model based on rectified flow matching that generates RIRs from descriptions in natural language. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that PromptReverb produces RIRs with superior perceptual quality and acoustic accuracy compared to existing methods, achieving 8.8% mean RT60 error compared to -37% for widely used baselines and yielding more realistic room-acoustic parameters. Our method enables practical applications in virtual reality, architectural acoustics, and audio production where flexible, high-quality RIR synthesis is essential.</description>

      <title>SimulMEGA: MoE Routers are Advanced Policy Makers for Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA (Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7 percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3 seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Multimodal Imbalance: A GMM-Guided Adaptive Loss for Audio-Visual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity of multimodal data leads to inconsistencies and imbalance, allowing a dominant modality to steer gradient updates. Existing solutions mainly focus on optimization- or data-based strategies but rarely exploit the information inherent in multimodal imbalance or conduct its quantitative analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel quantitative analysis framework for Multimodal Imbalance and design a sample-level adaptive loss function. We define the Modality Gap as the Softmax score difference between modalities for the correct class and model its distribution using a bimodal Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM), representing balanced and imbalanced samples. Using Bayes' theorem, we estimate each sample's posterior probability of belonging to these two groups. Based on this, our adaptive loss (1) minimizes the overall Modality Gap, (2) aligns imbalanced samples with balanced ones, and (3) adaptively penalizes each according to its imbalance degree. A two-stage training strategy-warm-up and adaptive phases,yields state-of-the-art performance on CREMA-D (80.65%), AVE (70.40%), and KineticSound (72.42%). Fine-tuning with high-quality samples identified by the GMM further improves results, highlighting their value for effective multimodal fusion.</description>
