      <title>Normed equivariant ring spectra and higher Tambara functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend equivariant infinite loop space theory to take into account multiplicative norms: For every finite group $G$, we construct a multiplicative refinement of the comparison between the $\infty$-categories of connective genuine $G$-spectra and space-valued Mackey functors, first proven by Guillou-May, and use this to give a description of connective normed equivariant ring spectra as space-valued Tambara functors.
  In more detail, we first introduce and study a general notion of homotopy-coherent normed (semi)rings, and identify these with product-preserving functors out of a corresponding $\infty$-category of bispans. In the equivariant setting, this identifies space-valued Tambara functors with normed algebras with respect to a certain normed monoidal structure on grouplike $G$-commutative monoids in spaces. We then show that the latter is canonically equivalent to the normed monoidal structure on connective $G$-spectra given by the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norms. Combining our comparison with results of Elmanto-Haugseng and Barwick-Glasman-Mathew-Nikolaus, we produce normed ring structures on equivariant algebraic K-theory spectra.</description>

      <title>Notes on abelianity of categories of finitely encoded persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When working with (multi-parameter) persistence modules, one usually makes some type of tameness assumption in order to obtain better control over their algebraic behavior. One such notion is Ezra Millers notion of finite encodability, which roughly states that a persistence module can be obtained by pulling back a finite dimensional persistence module over a finite poset. From the perspective of homological algebra, finitely encodable persistence have an inconvenient property: They do not form an abelian category. Here, we prove that if one restricts to such persistence modules which can be constructed in terms of topologically closed and sufficiently constructible (piecewise linear, semi-algebraic, etc.) upsets then abelianity can be restored.</description>

      <title>Topology of Cut Complexes II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the $k$-cut complex $\Delta_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ initiated in the paper of Bayer, Denker, Jeli\'c Milutinovi\'c, Rowlands, Sundaram and Xue [Topology of cut complexes of graphs, SIAM J. on Discrete Math. 38(2): 1630--1675 (2024)].
  We give explicit formulas for the $f$- and $h$-polynomials of the cut complex $\Delta_k(G_1+G_2) $ of the disjoint union of two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, and for the homology representation of $\Delta_k(K_m+K_n)$.
  We also study the cut complex of the squared path and the grid graph. Our techniques include tools from combinatorial topology, discrete Morse theory and equivariant poset topology.</description>

      <title>Scalar Function Topology Divergence: Comparing Topology of 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. On the other hand, the minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation.</description>

      <title>Topological Generalization Bounds for Discrete-Time Stochastic Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel set of rigorous and computationally efficient topology-based complexity notions that exhibit a strong correlation with the generalization gap in modern deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures correlate highly with generalization error in industry-standards architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures.</description>

      <title>Formality of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and cochains on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the loop and suspension functors on the category of augmented $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras. One application is to the formality of the cochain algebra of the $n$-sphere. We show that it is formal as an $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebra, also with coefficients in general commutative ring spectra, but rarely $\mathbb{E}_{n+1}$-formal unless the coefficients are rational. Along the way we show that the free functor from operads in spectra to monads in spectra is fully faithful on a nice subcategory of operads which in particular contains the stable $\mathbb{E}_n$-operads for finite $n$. We use this to interpret our results on loop and suspension functors of augmented algebras in operadic terms.</description>
