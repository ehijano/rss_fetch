      <title>Random triangulations of the d-sphere with minimum volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a higher-dimensional analogue of the {Random Travelling Salesman Problem}: let the complete $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $K_n^{d}$ on $n$ vertices be equipped with i.i.d.\ volumes on its facets, uniformly random in $[0,1]$. What is the minimum volume $M_{n,d}$ of a sub-complex homeomorphic to the $d$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, containing all vertices? We determine the growth rate of $M_{n,2}$, and prove that it is well-concentrated. For $d&gt;2$ we prove such results to the extent that current knowledge about the number of triangulations of $\mathbb{S}^d$ allows.
  We remark that this can be thought of as a model of random geometry in the spirit of Angel \&amp; Schramm's UIPT, and provide a generalised framework that interpolates between our model and the uniform random triangulation of $\mathbb{S}^d$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall II: Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of two works which study the discrete Gaussian free field on the binary tree when all leaves are conditioned to be positive. In the first work ("Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall I: Bounds") we identified the repulsion profile followed by the field in order to fulfill this "hard-wall constraint" event. In this work, we use these findings to obtain a comprehensive, sharp asymptotic description of the law of the field under this conditioning. We provide asymptotics for both local statistics, namely the (conditional) law of the field in a neighborhood of a vertex, as well as global statistics, including the (conditional) law of the minimum, maximum, empirical population mean and all subcritical exponential martingales. We conclude that the laws of the conditional and unconditional fields are asymptotically mutually singular with respect to each other.</description>

      <title>Minimal harmonic measure on 2D lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the harmonic measure (i.e. the limit of the hitting distribution of a simple random walk starting from a distant point) on three canonical two-dimensional lattices: the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, the triangular lattice $\mathscr{T}$ and the hexagonal lattice $\mathscr{H}$. In particular, for the least positive value of the harmonic measure of any $n$-point set, denoted by $\mathscr{M}_n(\mathscr{G})$, we prove in this paper that
  $$[\lambda(\mathscr{G})]^{-n+c\sqrt{n}} \le \mathscr{M}_n(\mathscr{G})\le [\lambda(\mathscr{G})]^{-n+C\sqrt{n}},$$
  where $\lambda(\mathbb{Z}^2)=(2+\sqrt{3})^2$, $\lambda(\mathscr{T})=3+2\sqrt{2}$ and $\lambda(\mathscr{H})=(\tfrac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2})^3$.
  Our results confirm a stronger version of the conjecture proposed by Calvert, Ganguly and Hammond (2023) which predicts the asymptotic of the exponent of $\mathscr{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}^2)$. Moreover, these estimates also significantly extend the findings in our previous paper with Kozma (2023) that $\mathscr{M}_n(\mathscr{G})$ decays exponentially for a large family of graphs $\mathscr{G}$ including $\mathscr{T}$, $\mathscr{H}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for all $d\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of Newtonian fluids in a stochastic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a velocity tracking problem for stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in a 2D-bounded domain. The control acts on the boundary through an injection-suction device with uncertainty, which acts in accordance with the non-homogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions. After establishing a suitable stability result for the solution of the stochastic state equation, we prove the well-posedness of the stochastic linearized state equation and show that the G\^ateaux derivative of the control-to-state mapping corresponds to the unique solution of the linearized equation. Next, we study the stochastic backward adjoint equation and establish a duality relation between the solutions of the forward linearized equation and the backward adjoint equation. Finally, we derive the first-order optimality conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two works which study the discrete Gaussian free field on the binary tree when all leaves are conditioned to be positive. In this work, we obtain sharp asymptotics for the probability of this "hard-wall constraint" event, and identify the repulsion profile followed by the field in order to achieve it. We also provide estimates for the mean, fluctuations and covariances of the field under the conditioning, which show that in the first log-many generations the field is localized around its mean. These results are used in the sequel work ("Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall II: Asymptotics") to obtain a comprehensive asymptotic description of the law of the field under the conditioning.</description>

      <title>Tail Bounds for Functions of Weighted Tensor Sums Derived from Random Walks on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents significant advancements in tensor analysis and the study of random walks on manifolds. It introduces new tensor inequalities derived using the Mond-Pecaric method, which enriches the existing mathematical tools for tensor analysis. This method, developed by mathematicians Mond and Pecaric, is a powerful technique for establishing inequalities in linear operators and matrices, using functional analysis and operator theory principles. The paper also proposes novel lower and upper bounds for estimating column sums of transition matrices based on their spectral information, which is critical for understanding random walk behavior. Additionally, it derives bounds for the right tail of weighted tensor sums derived from random walks on manifolds, utilizing the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator over the underlying manifolds and new tensor inequalities to enhance the understanding of these complex mathematical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the Stochastic Degasperis-Procesi (SDP) equation on $\mathbb{R}$ with an additive noise. Applying the kinetic theory, and considering the initial conditions in $L^2(\mathbb{R})\cap L^{2+\delta}(\mathbb{R})$, for arbitrary small $\delta&gt;0$, we establish the existence of a global pathwise solution. Restricting to the particular case of zero noise, our result improves the deterministic solvability results that exist in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the second class particle in half-line open TASEP under two different initial conditions with shock discontinuities. The exact formulas for the distribution of the second class particle can be derived by using the color-position symmetry theorem of colored half-space TASEP. We study the asymptotic distribution of second class particles under the constant scaling and KPZ-type scaling.</description>

      <title>Moduli of continuity for the local times of rebirthed Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ a be locally compact space with a countable base. Let $\cal Y$ be a transient symmetric Borel right process with state space $S$ and continuous strictly positive $p$--potential densities $u^p(x,y)$. Local and uniform moduli of continuity are obtained for the local times of both fully and partially rebirthed versions of $\cal Y$. A fully rebirthed version of $\cal Y$ is an extension of $\cal Y$ so that instead of terminating at the end of its lifetime it is immediately ``reborn'' with a probability measure $\mu $, on $S$. I.e., the process goes to the set $B\subset S$ with probability $\mu(B) $, after which it continues to evolve the way $\YY$ did, being reborn with probability $\mu $ each time it dies. This rebirthed version of $\cal Y$ is a recurrent Borel right process with state space $S$ and $p$-potential densities of form, \[ u^p(x,y)+h(x,y),\qquad x,y\in S,\,\, p&gt;0, \] where $h(x,y)$ is not symmetric.
  The local times of the rebirthed process are given in terms of the local times of $\cal Y$ and isomorphism theorems in the spirit of Dynkin, Eisenbam and Kaspi are obtained that relate these local times to generalized chi--square processes formed by Gaussian processes with covariances $u^{q}(x,y)$ for different values of $q$. These isomorphisms allow one to obtain exact local and uniform moduli of continuity for the local times of the rebirthed process. Several explicit examples are given in which $\cal Y$ is either a modified L\'evy process or a diffusion.
  Analogous results are obtained for partially rebirthed versions of $\cal Y$.
  This is obtained by starting $\cal Y$ in $S$ and when it dies returning it to $S$ with a sub-probability measure $\Xi$. (With probability $1-|\Xi |$ it is sent to a disjoint state space $S'$, where it remains.)</description>

      <title>On isomorphism of the space of $\alpha$-H\"older continuous functions with finite $p$-th variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the concept of (generalized) $p$-th variation of a real-valued continuous function along a general class of refining sequence of partitions. We show that the finiteness of the $p$-th variation of a given function is closely related to the finiteness of $\ell^p$-norm of the coefficients along a Schauder basis, similar to the fact that H\"older coefficient of the function is connected to $\ell^{\infty}$-norm of the Schauder coefficients. This result provides an isomorphism between the space of $\alpha$-H\"older continuous functions with finite (generalized) $p$-th variation along a given partition sequence and a subclass of infinite-dimensional matrices equipped with an appropriate norm, in the spirit of Ciesielski.</description>

      <title>Malliavin calculus on the Clifford algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with Malliavin calculus on the $L^2$ space of the $W^*$-algebra generated by fermion fields (the Clifford algebra). First, we verify the product formula for multiple integrals in It\^o-Clifford calculus, which is It\^o calculus on the Clifford algebra. Using this product formula, we can define the derivation operator and the divergence operator. Anti-symmetric Malliavin calculus thus constructed has properties similar to those of usual Malliavin calculus. The derivation operator and the divergence operator satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations, and the divergence operator serves as an extension of the It\^o-Clifford stochastic integral, satisfying the Clark-Ocone formula. Subsequently, using this calculus, we consider the concentration inequality, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and the fourth-moment theorem. For the concentration inequality, we obtain results that are almost similar to those of the usual case. For the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, we did not achieve significant results. The results concerning the fourth-moment theorem imply that, unlike in the case of the usual Brownian motion, convergence in distribution cannot be deduced from the convergence of the fourth moment.</description>

      <title>Alice and Bob on $\Bbb X$: reversal, coupling, renewal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neat question involving coin flips surfaced on $\Bbb X$, and generated an intensive outbreak of `social mathematics'. In a sequence of flips of a fair coin, Alice wins a point at each appearance of two consecutive heads, and Bob wins a point whenever a head is followed immediately by a tail. Who is more likely to win the game? The subsequent discussion illustrated conflicting intuitions, and concluded with the correct answer (it is a close thing). It is explained here why the context of the question is interesting and how it may be answered in a quantitative manner using the probabilistic techniques of reversal, coupling, and renewal.</description>

      <title>The open ASEP with light particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stationary measure of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with light particles. We prove several results on the asymptotic locations of the light particles under the stationary measure. Moreover, in the fan region of the high and low density phases, we study the mixing times for open ASEP with light particles. Our approach involves the matrix product ansatz, Askey-Wilson signed measures, moderate deviation results for second class particles, as well as various coupling arguments. Along the way we obtain the particle densities at single sites for the standard open ASEP without light particles, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, some new upper bounds for KL-divergence based on $L^1, L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms of density functions are discussed. Our findings unveil that the convergence in KL-divergence sense sandwiches between the convergence of density functions in terms of $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. Furthermore, we endeavor to apply our newly derived upper bounds to the analysis of the rate theorem of the entropic conditional central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>A computational transition for detecting correlated stochastic block models by low-degree polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of correlation in a pair of random graphs is a fundamental statistical and computational problem that has been extensively studied in recent years. In this work, we consider a pair of correlated (sparse) stochastic block models $\mathcal{S}(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ that are subsampled from a common parent stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon)$ with $k=O(1)$ symmetric communities, average degree $\lambda=O(1)$, divergence parameter $\epsilon$, and subsampling probability $s$.
  For the detection problem of distinguishing this model from a pair of independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with the same edge density $\mathcal{G}(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n})$, we focus on tests based on \emph{low-degree polynomials} of the entries of the adjacency matrices, and we determine the threshold that separates the easy and hard regimes. More precisely, we show that this class of tests can distinguish these two models if and only if $s&gt; \min \{ \sqrt{\alpha}, \frac{1}{\lambda \epsilon^2} \}$, where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is the Otter's constant and $\frac{1}{\lambda \epsilon^2}$ is the Kesten-Stigum threshold. Our proof of low-degree hardness is based on a conditional variant of the low-degree likelihood calculation.</description>

      <title>Favorite Sites for Simple Random Walk in Two and More Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the trace of a discrete-time simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 2$, we consider the evolution of favorite sites, i.e., sites that achieve the maximal local time at a certain time. For $d=2$, we show that almost surely three favorite sites occur simultaneously infinitely often and eventually there is no simultaneous occurrence of four favorite sites. For $d\geq 3$, we derive sharp asymptotics of the number of favorite sites. This answers an open question of Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}v\'{e}sz (1987), which was brought up again in Dembo (2005).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a random walk on the subgroup of lower triangular matrices of SL$_2$, with i.i.d. increments. We prove that the process of the lower corner of the random walk satisfies a Rogers-Pitman criterion to be a Markov chain if and only if the increments are distributed according to a Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GIG) law on their diagonals. For this, we prove a new characterization of these laws. We prove a discrete-time version of the Dufresne identity. We show how to recover the Matsumoto-Yor theorem by taking the continuous limit of the random walk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(V(u),\, u\in \mathcal{T})$ be a (supercritical) branching random walk and $(\eta_u,\,u\in \mathcal{T})$ be marks on the vertices of the tree,  distributed in an i.i.d.\ fashion. Following Aldous and Bandyopadhyay \cite{AB05}, for each infinite ray $\xi$ of the tree, we associate  the {\it discounted tree sum}  $D(\xi)$ which is the sum of the $e^{-V(u)}\eta_u$ taken along the ray. The paper deals with the finiteness of $\sup_\xi D(\xi)$. To this end, we study the extreme behaviour of the local time processes  of the paths $(V(u),\,u\in \xi)$. It answers a question of Nicolas Curien, and partially solves Open Problem 31 of Aldous and Bandyopadhyay \cite{AB05}. We also present several open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical system that undergoes a supercritical Hopf's bifurcation is perturbed by a multiplicative Brownian motion that scales with a small parameter $\epsilon$. The random fluctuations of the system at the critical point are studied when the dynamics starts near equilibrium, in the limit as $\epsilon$ goes to zero. Under a space-time scaling the system can be approximated by a 2-dimensional process lying on the centre manifold of the Hopf's bifurcation and a slow radial component together with a fast angular component are identified. Then the critical fluctuations are described by a "universal" stochastic differential equation whose coefficients are obtained taking the average with respect to the fast variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we show that the empirical measure of certain continuous time random walks satisfies a strong large deviation principle with respect to a topology introduced in~\cite{MV2016} by Mukherjee and Varadhan. This topology is natural in models which exhibit an invariance with respect to spatial translations. Our result applies in particular to the case of simple random walk and complements the results obtained in~\cite{MV2016} in which the large deviation principle has been established for the empirical measure of Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Probability Flow Approach to the Onsager--Machlup Functional for Jump-Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Onsager--Machlup action functional is an important concept in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics to describe the probability of fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems. It provides a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex stochastic systems. For diffusion process, the path integral method and the Girsanov transformation are two main approaches to construct the Onsager--Machlup functional. However, it is a long-standing challenge to apply these two methods to the jump-diffusion process, because the complexity of jump noise presents intrinsic technical barriers to derive the Onsager--Machlup functional. In this work, we propose a new strategy to solve this problem by utilizing the equivalent probabilistic flow between the pure diffusion process and the jump-diffusion process. For the first time, we rigorously establish the closed-form expression of the Onsager--Machlup functional for jump-diffusion processes with finite jump activity, which include an important term of the L\'{e}vy intensity at the origin. The same probability flow approach is further applied to the L\'{e}vy process with infinite jump activity, and yields a time-discrete version of the Onsager--Machlup functional.</description>

      <title>Multifractal spectrum of branching random walks on free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a transient symmetric branching random walk (BRW) on a free group $\mathbb{F}$ indexed by a Galton-Watson tree $\mathcal{T}$ without leaves. The limit set $\Lambda$ is defined as the random subset of $\partial \mathbb{F}$ (the boundary of $\mathbb{F}$) consisting of all ends in $\partial \mathbb{F}$ to which particle trajectories converge. Hueter--Lalley (2000) determined the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set, and found that $ \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \Lambda \leq \frac{1}{2} \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \partial \mathbb{F}$. In this paper, we conduct a multifractal analysis for the limit set $\Lambda$. We compute almost surely and simultaneously, the Hausdorff dimensions of the sets $\Lambda(\alpha) \subset \Lambda$ consisting of all ends in $\partial \mathbb{F}$ to which particle trajectories, with a rate of escape $\alpha$, converge. Moreover, for isotropic BRWs, we obtain the dimensions of the sets $\Lambda(\alpha,\beta) \subset \Lambda$ which consist of all ends in $\partial \mathbb{F}$ to which particle trajectories, with the average rates of escape having limit points $[\alpha,\beta]$, converge. Finally, analogous to results of Attia--Barral (2014), we obtain the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets $E(\alpha,\beta)$ of infinite branches in $\partial \mathcal{T}$ along which the averages of the BRW have $[\alpha,\beta]$ as the set of accumulation points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct continuum directed polymer measures corresponding to the critical 2d stochastic heat flow (2d SHF) introduced by Caravenna, Sun, and Zygouras in their recent article [Inventiones mathematicae 233, 325--460 (2023)]. For this purpose, we prove a Chapman-Kolmogorov relation for the 2d SHF along with a related elementary conditional expectation formula. We explore some basic properties of the continuum polymer measures, with our main focus being on their second moments. In particular, we show that the form of their second moments is consistent with the family of continuum polymer measures, indexed by a disorder strength parameter, having a conditional Gaussian multiplicative chaos distributional interrelationship similar to that previously found in an analogous hierarchical toy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, long time quantitative propagation of chaos in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for mean field interacting particle system is derived, where the diffusion coefficient is allowed to be interacting and the drift is assumed to be partially dissipative. The main tool relies on reflection coupling, the gradient estimate of the decoupled SDEs, and the Duhamel formula for two semigroups associated to two time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes on $(\mathbb{R}^d)^N$. Moreover, the long time quantitative propagation of chaos in $L^\eta$($\eta\in(0,1)$)-Wasserstein distance is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Stability of discrete-time Hawkes process with inhibition: towards a general condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a discrete-time analogue of a Hawkes process, modelled as a Poisson autoregressive process whose parameters depend on the past of the trajectory. The model is characterized to allow these parameters to take negative values, modelling inhibitory dynamics. More precisely, the model is the stochastic process $(\Tilde X_n)_{n\ge0}$ with parameters $a_1,\ldots,a_p \in \R$, $p\in\N$ and $\lambda &gt; 0$, such that for all $n\ge p$, conditioned on $\Tilde X_0,\ldots,\Tilde X_{n-1}$, $\Tilde X_n$ is Poisson distributed with parameter \[ \left(a_1 \Tilde X_{n-1} + \cdots + a_p \Tilde X_{n-p} + \lambda \right)_+. \] This process can be seen as a discrete time Hawkes process with inhibition with a memory of length $p$. %This work is an extension of a prior work where we studied the specific case $p = 2$, for which we were able to classify the asymptotic behaviour of the process for the whole range of parameters, except for boundary cases. We first provide a sufficient condition for stability in the general case which is the analog of a condition for continuous time Hawkes processes from \cite{costa_renewal_2020}. We then focus on the case $p=3$, extending the results derived for the $p=2$ case in a previous work \cite{Costa_Maillard_Muraro_2024}. In particular, we show that the process may be stable even if one of the coefficients $a_i$ is much greater than one.</description>

      <title>Record-biased permutations and their permuton limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a non-uniform distribution on permutations biased by their number of records that we call \emph{record-biased permutations}. We give several generative processes for record-biased permutations, explaining also how they can be used to devise efficient (linear) random samplers. For several classical permutation statistics, we obtain their expectation using the above generative processes, as well as their limit distributions in the regime that has a logarithmic number of records (as in the uniform case). Finally, increasing the bias to obtain a regime with an expected linear number of records, we establish the convergence of record-biased permutations to a deterministic permuton, which we fully characterize.
  This model was introduced in our earlier work [N. Auger, M. Bouvel, C. Nicaud, C. Pivoteau, \emph{Analysis of Algorithms for Permutations Biased by Their Number of Records}, AofA 2016], in the context of realistic analysis of algorithms. We conduct here a more thorough study but with a theoretical perspective.</description>

      <title>Phase transition for the bottom singular vector of rectangular random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the rectangular random matrix $X=(x_{ij})\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ whose entries are iid with tail $\mathbb{P}(|x_{ij}|&gt;t)\sim t^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We consider the regime $N(n)/n\to \mathsf{a}&gt;1$ as $n$ tends to infinity. Our main interest lies in the right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value, which we will refer to as the "bottom singular vector", denoted by $\mathfrak{u}$. In this paper, we prove the following phase transition regarding the localization length of $\mathfrak{u}$: when $\alpha&lt;2$ the localization length is $O(n/\log n)$; when $\alpha&gt;2$ the localization length is of order $n$. Similar results hold for all right singular vectors around the smallest singular value. The variational definition of the bottom singular vector suggests that the mechanism for this localization-delocalization transition when $\alpha$ goes across $2$ is intrinsically different from the one for the top singular vector when $\alpha$ goes across $4$.</description>

      <title>On some stochastic hyperbolic equations with symplectic characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of Gaussian perturbations on
  a class of model hyperbolic partial differential
  equations with double symplectic characteristics in
  low spatial dimensions, extending some recent work
  in [5]. The coefficients of our
  partial differential operators contain harmonic oscillators
  in the space variables, while the noise is additive,
  white in time and colored in space.
  We provide sufficient conditions on the spectral
  measure of the covariance functional describing the
  noise that allows for the existence of a random field
  solution for the resulting stochastic partial
  differential equation.
  Furthermore we show how the symplectic structure of the set of
  multiple points affects the regularity of the noise
  needed to build a measurable process solution.
  Our approach is based on some explicit computations for the
  fundamental solutions of several model partial
  differential operators together with their explicit Fourier transforms.</description>

      <title>Sharp threshold for the ballisticity of the random walk on the exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a non-reversible random walk advected by the symmetric simple exclusion process, so that the walk has a local drift of opposite sign when sitting atop an occupied or an empty site. We prove that the back-tracking probability of the walk exhibits a sharp transition as the density $\rho$ of particles in the underlying exclusion process varies across a critical density $\rho_c$. Our results imply that the speed $v=v(\rho)$ of the walk is a strictly monotone function and that the zero-speed regime is either absent or collapses to a single point, $\rho_c$, thus solving a conjecture of arXiv:1906.03167. The proof proceeds by exhibiting a quantitative monotonicity result for the speed of a truncated model, in which the environment is renewed after a finite time horizon $L$. The truncation parameter $L$ is subsequently pitted against the density $\rho$ to carry estimates over to the full model. Our strategy is somewhat reminiscent of certain techniques recently used to prove sharpness results in percolation problems. A key instrument is a combination of renormalisation arguments with refined couplings of environments at slightly different densities, which we develop in this article. Our results hold in fact in greater generality and apply to a class of environments with possibly egregious features, outside perturbative regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing of contingent claims of American style, using indifference pricing by fully dynamic convex risk measures. We provide a general definition of risk-indifference prices for buyers and sellers in continuous time, in a setting where buyer and seller have potentially different information, and show that these definitions are consistent with no-arbitrage principles. Specifying to stochastic volatility models, we characterize indifference prices via solutions of Backward Stochastic Differential Equations reflected at Backward Stochastic Differential Equations and show that this characterization provides a basis for the implementation of numerical methods using deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal filtering problem for a interacting particle system generated by stochastic differential equations with interaction. By using Malliavin calculus, we construct the differential equation of the covariance process and transform the filter problem to an optimal control problem. Finally we give the necessary condition that the coefficient of the optimal filter should satisfy</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many first-passage processes in complex media and related diffusion-controlled reactions can be described by means of eigenfunctions of the mixed Steklov-Neumann problem. In this paper, we investigate this spectral problem in a common setting when a small target or escape window (with Steklov condition) is located on the reflecting boundary (with Neumann condition). We start by inspecting two basic settings: an arc-shaped target on the boundary of a disk and a spherical-cap-shaped target on the boundary of a ball. We construct the explicit kernel of an integral operator that determines the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and deduce their asymptotic behavior in the small-target limit. By relating the limiting kernel to an appropriate Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, we extend these asymptotic results to other bounded domains with smooth boundaries. A straightforward application to first-passage processes is presented; in particular, we revisit the small-target behavior of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets, as well as for more sophisticated surface reactions that extend the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Commutator estimates for Haar shifts with general measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $L^p(\mu)$ estimates for the commutator $[H,b]$, where the operator $H$ is a dyadic model of the classical Hilbert transform introduced in \cite{arXiv:2012.10201,arXiv:2212.00090} and is adapted to a non-doubling Borel measure $\mu$ satisfying a dyadic regularity condition which is necessary for $H$ to be bounded on $L^p(\mu)$. We show that $\|[H, b]\|_{L^p(\mu) \rightarrow L^p(\mu)} \lesssim \|b\|_{\mathrm{BMO}(\mu)}$, but to {\it characterize} martingale BMO requires additional commutator information. We prove weighted inequalities for $[H, b]$ together with a version of the John-Nirenberg inequality adapted to appropriate weight classes $\widehat{A}_p$ that we define for our non-homogeneous setting. This requires establishing reverse H\"{o}lder inequalities for these new weight classes. Finally, we revisit the appropriate class of nonhomogeneous measures $\mu$ for the study of different types of Haar shift operators.</description>

      <title>On the risk levels of distributionally robust chance constrained problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chance constraints ensure the satisfaction of constraints under uncertainty with a desired probability. This scheme is unfortunately sensitive to assumptions of the probability distribution of the uncertainty, which are difficult to verify. The uncertainty in the probability distribution can be considered via ambiguity sets that include all distributions close to a nominal distribution with respect to different ambiguity metrics. One simple methodology to deal with distributional ambiguity is to solve the original chance constrained problem with a specifically lowered risk level, called perturbed risk level
  In this paper, we compare different ambiguity metrics for which a perturbed risk level exists. The comparison highlights that one particular ambiguity metric is especially well suited to handle low risk levels, which are typically needed in control applications. To approximate the solution of the ambiguous chance constrained problem, we present a general method to achieve distributionally robust bounds with methods like the scenario approach and derive closed-form expressions for the confidence level and one-level probability bounds.</description>

      <title>Random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries and the Cohen--Lenstra distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of the cokernels of random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries. Let $X_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ in which some entries are fixed to be zero and the other entries are i.i.d. copies of a random variable $\xi \in \mathbb{Z}_p$. We consider the minimal number of random entries of $X_n$ required for the cokernel of $X_n$ to converge to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution. When $\xi$ is given by the Haar measure, we prove a lower bound of the number of random entries and prove its converse-type result using random regular bipartite multigraphs. When $\xi$ is a general random variable, we determine the minimal number of random entries. Let $M_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $k$-step stairs of zeros and the other entries given by independent random $\epsilon$-balanced variables valued in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We prove that the cokernel of $M_n$ converges to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution under a mild assumption. This extends Wood's universality theorem on random $p$-adic matrices.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations for the boundary-driven zero-range process on graphs: microscopic versus macroscopic approach and a theory of non-reversible resistor-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint large deviation rate functional in the limit of large time for the current flowing through the edges of a finite graph for a boundary-driven zero-range dynamics. This generalizes one-dimensional results previously obtained with different approaches \cite{BDGJL1,HRS}; our alternative techniques illuminate various connections and complementary perspectives. In particular, we here use a variational approach to derive the rate functional by contraction from a level 2.5 large deviation rate functional. We perform an exact minimization and finally obtain the rate functional as a variational problem involving a superposition of cost functions for each edge. The contributions from different edges are not independent since they are related by the values of a potential function on the nodes of the graph. The rate functional on the graph is a microscopic version of the continuous rate functional predicted by the macroscopic fluctuation theory \cite{MFT}, and we indeed show a convergence in the scaling limit. If we split the graph into two connected regions by a cutset and are interested just in the current flowing through the cutset, we find that the result is the same as that of an effective system composed of only one effective edge (as happens at macroscopic level and is expected also for other models \cite{Cap}). The characteristics of this effective edge are related to the ``capacities'' of the graph and can be obtained by a reduction using elementary transformations as in electrical networks; specifically, we treat components in parallel, in series, and in $N$-star configurations (reduced to effective complete $N$-graphs). Our reduction procedure is directly related to the reduction to the trace process \cite{L} and, since the dynamics is in general not reversible, it is also closely connected to the theory of non-reversible electrical networks in \cite{B}.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Heterogeneous Deffuant-Weisbuch Model: A Complete Proof and Some Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deffuant-Weisbuch (DW) model is a well-known bounded-confidence opinion dynamics that has attracted wide interest. Although the heterogeneous DW model has been studied by simulations over $20$ years, its convergence proof is open. Our previous paper \cite{GC-WS-WM-FB:20} solves the problem for the case of uniform weighting factors greater than or equal to $1/2$, but the general case remains unresolved.
  This paper considers the DW model with heterogeneous confidence bounds and heterogeneous (unconstrained) weighting factors and shows that, with probability one, the opinion of each agent converges to a fixed vector. In other words, this paper resolves the convergence conjecture for the heterogeneous DW model. Our analysis also clarifies how the convergence speed may be arbitrarily slow under certain parameter conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary value problems for harmonic functions on open connected subsets of post-critically finite (p.c.f.) self-similar sets, on which the Laplacian is defined through a strongly recurrent self-similar local regular Dirichlet form. For a p.c.f. self-similar set $K$, we prove that for any open connected subset $\Omega\subset K$ whose "geometric" boundary is a graph-directed self-similar set, there exists a finite number of matrices called $\textit{flux transfer matrices}$ whose products generate the hitting probability from a point in $\Omega$ to the "resistance" boundary $\partial \Omega$. The harmonic functions on $\Omega$ can be expressed by integrating functions on $\partial \Omega$ against the probability measures. Furthermore, we obtain a two-sided estimate of the energy of a harmonic function in terms of its values on $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <title>Two-layers neural networks for Schr{\"o}dinger eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyze numerical schemes using two-layer neural networks withinfinite width for the resolution of high-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger eigenvalue problems with smoothinteraction potentials and Neumann boundary condition on the unit cube in any dimension. Moreprecisely, any eigenfunction associated to the lowest eigenvalue of the Schr{\"o}dinger operator is a unitL 2 norm minimizer of the associated energy. Using Barron's representation of the solution witha probability measure defined on the set of parameter values and following the approach initiallysuggested by Bach and Chizat [1], the energy is minimized thanks to a constrained gradient curvedynamic on the 2-Wasserstein space of the set of parameter values defining the neural network. Weprove the existence of solutions to this constrained gradient curve. Furthermore, we prove that,if it converges, the represented function is then an eigenfunction of the considered Schr{\"o}dingeroperator. At least up to our knowledge, this is the first work where this type of analysis is carriedout to deal with the minimization of non-convex functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result of Kaimanovich and Vershik and independently of Rosenblatt that a non-amenable group admits a non-degenerate symmetric measure such that the Poisson boundary is trivial. Most if not all examples to date of non-free actions of countable groups on their Poisson boundaries had the stabilizers sitting inside the amenable radical. We show that every countable non-C*-simple group admits a symmetric measure of full support with non-trivial stabilizers. For a class of non-C*-simple groups with trivial amenable radical, which is non-empty as was shown by le Boudec, this gives a wealth of examples with non-normal stabilizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study percolative properties of excursion processes and the discrete Gaussian free field (dGFF) in the planar unit disk. We consider discrete excursion clouds, defined using random walks as a two-dimensional version of random interlacements, as well as its scaling limit, defined using Brownian motion. We prove that the critical parameters associated to vacant set percolation for the two models are the same and equal to $\pi/3.$ The value is obtained from a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) computation. Via an isomorphism theorem, we use a generalization of the discrete result that also involves a loop soup (and an SLE computation) to show that the critical parameter associated to level set percolation for the dGFF is strictly positive and smaller than $\sqrt{\pi/2}.$ In particular this entails a strict inequality of the type $h_*&lt;\sqrt{2u_*}$ between the critical percolation parameters of the dGFF and the two-dimensional excursion cloud. Similar strict inequalities are conjectured to hold in a general transient setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates higher dimensional versions of the longstanding conjecture verified in [Ba\~nuelos and Kwa\'snicki, Duke Math. J. (2019)] that the $\ell^p$-norm of the discrete Hilbert transform on the integers is the same as the $L^p$-norm of the Hilbert transform on the real line. It computes the $\ell^p$-norms of a family of discrete operators on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d\geq 1.$ They are discretizations of a new class of singular integrals on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that have the same kernels as the classical Riesz transforms near zero and similar behavior at infinity. The discrete operators have the same $p$-norms as the classical Riesz transforms on $\mathbb{R}^d$. They are constructed as conditional expectations of martingale transforms of Doob h-processes conditioned to exit the upper--half space $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}_{+}$ only on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The paper also presents a discrete analogue of the classical method of rotations which gives the norm of a different variant of discrete Riesz transforms on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Along the way a new proof is given based on Fourier transform techniques of the key identity used to identify the norm of the discrete Hilbert transform in [Ba\~nuelos and Kwa\'snicki, Duke Math. J. (2019)]. Open problems are stated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04580v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a three-parameter family of random surfaces in Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) which can be viewed as the quantum version of triangles. These quantum triangles are natural in two senses. First, by our definition they produce the boundary three-point correlation functions of Liouville conformal field theory on the disk. Second, it turns out that the laws of the triangles bounded by flow lines in imaginary geometry coupled with LQG are given by these quantum triangles. In this paper we demonstrate the second point for boundary flow lines on a quantum disk. Our method has the potential to prove general conformal welding results with quantum triangles glued in an arbitrary way. Quantum triangles play a basic role in understanding the integrability of SLE and LQG via conformal welding. In this paper, we deduce integrability results for chordal SLE with three force points, using the conformal welding of a quantum triangle and a two-pointed quantum disk. In a subsequent work we will explore their applications to the mating-of-trees framework of LQG, including the exact evaluation of the expected proportion of inversions in skew Brownian permutons.</description>

      <title>A top-down approach to algebraic renormalization in regularity structures based on multi-indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an algebraic framework to describe renormalization in regularity structures based on multi-indices for a large class of semi-linear stochastic PDEs. This framework is ``top-down", in the sense that we postulate the form of the counterterm and use the renormalized equation to build a canonical smooth model for it. The core of the construction is a generalization of the Hopf algebra of derivations in [LOT23], which is extended beyond the structure group to describe the model equation via an exponential map: This allows to implement a renormalization procedure which resembles the preparation map approach in our context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the stochastic wave equation in spatial dimensions $d \le 2$ with multiplicative L\'evy noise that can have infinite $p$-th moments. Using the past light-cone property of the wave equation, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution, considering only the $p$-integrability of the L\'evy measure $\nu$ for the region corresponding to the small jumps of the noise. For $d=1$, there are no restrictions on $\nu$. For $d=2$, we assume that there exists a value $p \in (0,2)$ for which $\int_{ \{|z|\le 1 \} } |z|^p \nu (dz) &lt; + \infty$.</description>

      <title>The inhomogeneous multispecies PushTASEP: Dynamics and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a natural multispecies variant of the inhomogeneous PushTASEP with site-dependent rates on the finite ring. We show that the stationary distribution of this process is proportional to the ASEP polynomials at $q = 1$ and $t = 0$. This is done by constructing a multiline process which projects to the multispecies PushTASEP, and identifying its stationary distribution using time-reversal arguments. We also study symmetry properties of the process under interchange of the rates associated to the sites. These results hold not just for events depending on the configuration at a single time in equilibrium, but also for systems out of equilibrium and for events depending on the path of the process over time. Lastly, we give explicit formulas for nearest-neighbour two-point correlations in terms of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Convexity for Logarithmic Moment Generating Functions with Applications in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any convex function $F$ of $n$-dimensional Gaussian vector $g$ with $\mathbb{E} e^{\lambda F(g)}&lt;\infty$ for any $\lambda&gt;0$, we show that $\lambda^{-1}\ln \mathbb{E} e^{\lambda F(g)}$ is convex in $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$. Based on this convexity, we draw three major consequences. The first recovers a version of the Paouris-Valettas lower deviation inequality for Gaussian convex functions with an improved exponent. The second establishes a quantitative bound for the Dotsenko-Franz-M\'ezard conjecture arising from the study of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) mean-field spin glass model, which states that in the absence of external field, the annealed free energy of negative replica is asymptotically equal to the free energy. The last further establishes the differentiability for this annealed free energy with respect to the negative replica variable at any temperature and external field.</description>

      <title>Random Surfaces and Higher Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space of surfaces $\mathbf{X}: [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is equipped with natural horizontal and vertical concatenation operations, and we study representations of surfaces which preserve this algebraic structure. The framework of higher category theory allows us to formalize this notion in terms of a functor between double groupoids. We construct such functors by generalizing the classical concept of the path-ordered exponential as a nonabelian path integral. This generalization yields a notion of nonabelian surface integration, and is known in higher gauge theory as surface holonomy (or higher parallel transport). We extend these constructions from smooth surfaces to bounded controlled $p$-variation surfaces in the Young regime, with $p &lt; 2$. By focusing on surface holonomy valued in higher generalizations of the classical matrix groups, called matrix double groups, we obtain explicit computations for piecewise linear approximations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonabelian Stokes' and Fubini theorems to the Young regime. Finally, we use these matrix surface holonomy functors to construct characteristic functions for random surfaces such as fractional Brownian sheets with Hurst parameter $h&gt; \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate Analysis in Limit Theorems for Nonlinear Functionals of the Second Wiener Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the distribution distance between random vectors derived from the magnitude of the analytic wavelet transform of the squared envelopes of Gaussian processes and their large-scale limits. When the Hurst index of the underlying Gaussian process falls below 1/2, the large-scale limit takes the form of a combination of the second and fourth Wiener chaos. In this case, we employ the non-Stein approach to determine the convergence rate in the Kolmogorov metric. In scenarios where the Hurst index of the underlying Gaussian process exceeds 1/2, the large-scale limit is a correlated chi-distributed random process with two degrees of freedom. The convergence rate in the Wasserstein metric is derived through the application of Malliavin calculus and multidimensional Stein's method. Although the large-scale limits are the same for Hurst indices within the interval (1/2,1), notable differences in the upper bounds of convergence rates are observed among Hurst indices falling within the subintervals (1/2,3/4) and (3/4,1).</description>

      <title>The friendship paradox for sparse random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ be an undirected finite graph on $n\in\mathbb{N}$ vertices labelled by $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$. For $i \in [n]$, let $\Delta_{i,n}$ be the friendship bias of vertex $i$, defined as the difference between the average degree of the neighbours of vertex $i$ and the degree of vertex $i$ itself when $i$ is not isolated, and zero when $i$ is isolated. Let $\mu_n$ denote the friendship-bias empirical distribution, i.e., the measure that puts mass $\frac{1}{n}$ at each $\Delta_{i,n}$, $i \in [n]$. The friendship paradox says that if $G_n$ has no self-loops, then $\int_{\mathbb{R}} x\mu_n(\mathrm{d}x) \geq 0$, with equality if and only if in each connected component of $G_n$ all the degrees are the same.
  We show that if $(G_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of sparse random graphs that converges to a rooted random tree in the sense of convergence locally in probability, then $\mu_n$ converges weakly to a limiting measure $\mu$ that is expressible in terms of the law of the rooted random tree. We study $\mu$ for four classes of sparse random graphs: the homogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the configuration model and the preferential attachment model. In particular, we compute the first two moments of $\mu$, identify the right tail of $\mu$, and argue that $\mu([0,\infty))\geq\tfrac{1}{2}$, a property we refer to as friendship-paradox significance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Stopping of BSDEs with Constrained Jumps and Related Double Obstacle PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider partial differential equations (PDEs) characterized by an upper barrier that depends on the solution itself and a fixed lower barrier, while accommodating a non-local driver. First, we show a Feynman-Kac representation for the PDE when the driver is local. Specifically, we relate the non-linear Snell envelope for an optimal stopping problem, where the underlying process is the first component in the solution to a stopped backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with jumps and a constraint on the jumps process, to a viscosity solution for the PDE. Leveraging this Feynman-Kac representation, we subsequently prove existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions in the non-local setting by employing a contraction argument. In addition, the contraction argument yields existence of a new type of non-linear Snell envelope and extends the theory of probabilistic representation for PDEs.</description>

      <title>Curie-Weiss Model under $\ell^{p}$ constraint and a Generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Ising Curie-Weiss model on the complete graph constrained under a given $\ell^{p}$ norm for some $p&gt;0$. For $p=\infty$, it reduces to the classical Ising Curie-Weiss model. We prove that for all $p&gt;2$, there exists $\beta_{c}(p)$ such that for $\beta&lt;\beta_{c}(p)$, the magnetization is concentrated at zero and satisfies an appropriate Gaussian CLT. In contrast, for $\beta&gt;\beta_{c}(p)$ the magnetization is concentrated at $\pm m_\ast$ for some $m_\ast&gt;0$. We have $\beta_{c}(p)&gt;1$ for $p&gt;2$ and $\lim_{p\to\infty}\beta_{c}(p)=3$. We further generalize the model for general symmetric spin distributions and prove a similar phase transition. For $0&lt;p&lt;1$, the log-partition function scales at the order of $n^{2/p-1}$. The proofs are based on a generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich (GHS) transform, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases. In particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the lowest logarithmic energy of the family.</description>

Abstract: The standard convex closed hull of a set is defined as the intersection of all images, under the action of a group of rigid motions, of a half-space containing the given set. In this paper we propose a generalisation of this classical notion, that we call a $(K,\mathbb{H})$-hull, and which is obtained from the above construction by replacing a half-space with some other convex closed subset $K$ of the Euclidean space, and a group of rigid motions by a subset $\mathbb{H}$ of the group of invertible affine transformations. The main focus is put on the analysis of $(K,\mathbb{H})$-convex hulls of random samples from $K$.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we consider a graph process recently introduced by Frieze, Krivelevich and Michaeli. In their model, the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ are ordered uniformly at random and are then revealed consecutively to a player called Builder. At every round, Builder must decide if they accept the edge proposed at this round or not. We prove that, for every $d\ge 2$, Builder can construct a spanning $d$-connected graph after $(1+o(1))n\log n/2$ rounds by accepting $(1+o(1))dn/2$ edges with probability converging to 1 as $n\to \infty$. This settles a conjecture of Frieze, Krivelevich and Michaeli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops two mathematical models to understand subjects' behavior in response to the urgency of a change and inputs from governments e.g., (subsides) in the context of the diffusion of the solar photovoltaic in Italy. The first model is a Markovian model of interacting particle systems. The second one, instead, is a Mean Field Game model. In both cases, we derive the scaling limit deterministic dynamics, and we compare the latter to the Italian solar photovoltaic data. We identify periods where the first model describes the behavior of domestic data well and a period where the second model captures a particular feature of data corresponding to companies. The comprehensive analysis, integrated with a philosophical inquiry focusing on the conceptual vocabulary and correlative implications, leads to the formulation of hypotheses about the efficacy of different forms of governmental subsidies.</description>

Abstract: We first introduce a new model for a two-dimensional gauge-covariant wave equation with space-time white noise. In our main theorem, we obtain the probabilistic global well-posedness of this model in the Lorenz gauge. Furthermore, we prove the failure of a probabilistic null-form estimate, which exposes a potential obstruction towards the probabilistic well-posedness of a stochastic Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>The universal equivariance properties of exotic aromatic B-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exotic aromatic Butcher series were originally introduced for the calculation of order conditions for the high order numerical integration of ergodic stochastic differential equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and on manifolds. We prove in this paper that exotic aromatic B-series satisfy a universal geometric property, namely that they are characterised by locality and equivariance with respect to orthogonal changes of coordinates. This characterisation confirms that exotic aromatic B-series are a fundamental geometric object that naturally generalises aromatic B-series and B-series, as they share similar equivariance properties. In addition, we provide a classification of the main subsets of the exotic aromatic B-series, in particular the exotic B-series, using different equivariance properties. Along the analysis, we present a generalised definition of exotic aromatic trees, dual vector fields, and we explore the impact of degeneracies on the classification.</description>

      <title>Criteria for the absence of arbitrage in general diffusion markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish deterministic necessary and sufficient conditions for the no-arbitrage notions NA ("no arbitrage"), NUPBR ("no unbounded profit with bounded risk") and NFLVR ("no free lunch with vanishing risk") in general diffusion market models with finite and infinite time horizons. These are single asset models whose (discounted) asset price process $Y$ is a regular continuous strong Markov process that is also a semimartingale. We further characterize the existence of an equivalent martingale measure in such models. All deterministic criteria are provided in terms of the scale function and the speed measure of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Application of the Fermi function in money exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a money exchange process involving a seller and a buyer, we develop a straightforward model encompassing conservative, non-conservative, and systems with or without debt. Our model integrates the Fermi function to capture the behavior of buyers and sellers. Under certain circumstances, we identify an equation that marks the phase transition between a stable equal wealth state across all connected social graphs and an unstable equal wealth state in some connected social graph.</description>

      <title>First order complexity of finite random structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of random structures with $n$-element domains over a relational signature, we define its first order (FO) complexity as a certain subset in the Banach space $\ell^{\infty}/c_0$. The well-known FO zero-one law and FO convergence law correspond to FO complexities equal to $\{0,1\}$ and a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, respectively. We present a hierarchy of FO complexity classes, introduce a stochastic FO reduction that allows to transfer complexity results between different random structures, and deduce using this tool several new logical limit laws for binomial random structures. Finally, we introduce a conditional distribution on graphs, subject to a FO sentence $\varphi$, that generalises certain well-known random graph models, show instances of this distribution for every complexity class, and prove that the set of all $\varphi$ validating 0--1 law is not recursively enumerable.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>
