      <title>The Braid Indices of Pretzel Links: A Comprehensive Study, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of our comprehensive study on the braid index problem of pretzel links. Our ultimate goal is to completely determine the braid indices of all pretzel links, alternating or non alternating. In our approach, we divide the pretzel links into three types as follows. Let $D$ be a standard diagram of an oriented pretzel link $\mathcal{L}$, $S(D)$ be the Seifert circle decomposition of $D$, and $C_1$, $C_2$ be the Seifert circles in $S(D)$ containing the top and bottom long strands of $D$ respectively, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 1 (Type 2) pretzel link if $C_1\not=C_2$ and $C_1$, $C_2$ have different (identical) orientations. In the case that $C_1=C_2$, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 3 pretzel link. In our previous paper, we succeeded in reaching our goal for all Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links. That is, we successfully derived precise braid index formulas for all Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links. In this paper, we present the results of our study on Type 3 pretzel links. In this case, we are very close to reaching our goal. More precisely, with the exception of a small percentage of Type 3 pretzel links, we are able to determine the precise braid indices for the majority of Type 3 pretzel links. Even for those exceptional ones, we are able to determine their braid indices within two consecutive integers. With some numerical evidence, we conjecture that in such a case, the braid index of the Type 3 pretzel link is given by the larger of the two consecutive integers given by our formulas.</description>

      <title>Geometric structures for maximal representations and pencils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fibrations of the projective model for the symmetric space associated with $\text{SL}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ by codimension $2$ projective subspaces, or pencils of quadrics. In particular we show that if such a smooth fibration is equivariant with respect to a representation of a closed surface group, the representation is quasi-isometrically embedded, and even Anosov if the pencils in the image contain only non-degenerate quadrics. We use this to characterize maximal representations among representations of a closed surface group into $\text{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ by the existence of an equivariant continuous fibration of the associated symmetric space, satisfying an additional technical property. These fibrations extend to fibrations of the projective structures associated to maximal representations by bases of pencils of quadrics.</description>

      <title>Perverse schobers, stability conditions and quadratic differentials II: relative graded Brauer graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of dg-algebras which generalize the classical Brauer graph algebras. They are constructed from mixed-angulations of surfaces and often admit a (relative) Calabi--Yau structure. We discovered these algebras through two very distinct routes, one involving perverse schobers whose stalks are cyclic quotients of the derived categories of relative Ginzburg algebras, and another involving deformations of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces. Applying the results of our previous work arXiv:2303.18249, we describe the spaces of stability conditions on the derived categories of these algebras in terms of spaces of quadratic differentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We put a new spin on Khovanov--Rozansky homology. That is, we equip $\Lambda^n$-colored $\mathfrak{sl}_{2n}$ Khovanov--Rozansky homology with an involution whose $\pm 1$-eigenspaces are link invariants. When $n=1,2,3$ (and assuming technical conjectures for $n \geq 4$), we prove that this refined invariant categorifies the spin-colored $\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$ quantum link polynomial. Along the way, we partially develop the theory of quantum $\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$ webs and make contact with $\iota$quantum groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two players play a game by alternately splitting a surface of a compact $2$-manifold along a simple closed curve that is not null-homotopic and attaching disks to the resulting boundary; the last player who can move wins. Starting from an orientable surface, the $G$-series is $01\dot{2}\dot{0}$ according to increasing genus. Starting from a nonorientable surface, the $G$-series is $012\dot{4}60\dot{3}$ according to increasing genus. Nim addition determines the $G$-values of the remaining compact $2$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Non-density results in high dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We push forward the study of higher dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology by establishing two non-density results. First, we prove that stable hypersurfaces are not $C^2$-dense in any isotopy class of embedded hypersurfaces on any ambient symplectic manifold of dimension $2n\geq 8$. Our second result is that on any manifold of dimension $2m+1\geq 5$, the set of non-degenerate stable Hamiltonian structures is not $C^2$-dense among stable Hamiltonian structures in any given stable homotopy class that satisfies a mild assumption. The latter generalizes a result by Cieliebak and Volkov to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>The regularity of ODEs and thimble integrals with respect to Borel summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through Borel summation, one can often reconstruct an analytic solution of a problem from its asymptotic expansion. We view the effectiveness of Borel summation as a regularity property of the solution, and we show that the solutions of certain differential equation and integration problems are regular in this sense. By taking a geometric perspective on the Laplace and Borel transforms, we also clarify why "Borel regular" solutions are associated with special points on the Borel plane. The particular classes of problems we look at are level 1 ODEs and exponential period integrals over one dimensional Lefschetz thimbles. To expand the variety of examples available in the literature, we treat various examples of these problems in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider birack and switch colorings of braids. We define a switch structure on the set of permutation representations of the braid group and consider when such a representation is a switch automorphism. We define quiver-valued invariants of braids using finite switches and biracks and use these to categorify the birack 2-cocycle invariant for braids. We obtain new polynomial invariants of braids via decategorification of these quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a combinatorial structure of orthogeodesics on hyperbolic surfaces and presents several relations among them. As a primary application, we propose a recursive method for computing the trace (the hyperbolic cosine of the length) of orthogeodesics and establish the existence of surfaces where the trace of each orthogeodesic is an integer. These surfaces and their orthogeodesics are closely related to integral Apollonian circle packings. Notably, we found a new type of root-flipping that transitions between roots in different quadratic Diophantine equations of a certain type, with Vieta root-flipping as a special case. Finally, we provide a combinatorial proof of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces, akin to Bowditch's combinatorial proof of the McShane identity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of mc-biquandles, algebraic structures which have possibly distinct biquandle operations at single-component and multi-component crossings. These structures provide computable homset invariants for classical and virtual links. We categorify these homsets to obtain mc-biquandle coloring quivers and define several new link invariants via decategorification from these invariant quivers.</description>

      <title>CWR sequence of invariants of alternating links and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the $CWR$ invariant, a new invariant for alternating links, which builds upon and generalizes the $WRP$ invariant. The $CWR$ invariant is an array of two-variable polynomials that provides a stronger invariant compared to the $WRP$ invariant. We compare the strength of our invariant with the classical HOMFLYPT, Kauffman $3$-variable, and Kauffman $2$-variable polynomials on specific knot examples. Additionally, we derive general recursive "skein" relations, and also specific formulas for the initial components of the $CWR$ invariant using weighted adjacency matrices of modified Tait graphs.</description>

      <title>The Manhattan curve, ergodic theory of topological flows and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every non-elementary hyperbolic group, we introduce the Manhattan curve associated to any pair of left-invariant hyperbolic metrics which are quasi-isometric to a word metric. It is convex; we show that it is continuously differentiable and moreover is a straight line if and only if the corresponding two metrics are roughly similar, i.e., they are within bounded distance after multiplying by a positive constant. Further, we prove that the Manhattan curve associated to two strongly hyperbolic metrics is twice continuously differentiable. The proof is based on the ergodic theory of topological flows associated to general hyperbolic groups and analyzing the multifractal structure of Patterson-Sullivan measures. We exhibit some explicit examples including a hyperbolic triangle group and compute the exact value of the mean distortion for pairs of word metrics.</description>

      <title>Right-angled Artin groups and the cohomology basis graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finite graph and let $A(\Gamma)$ be the corresponding right-angled Artin group. From an arbitrary basis $\mathcal B$ of $H^1(A(\Gamma),\mathbb F)$ over an arbitrary field, we construct a natural graph $\Gamma_{\mathcal B}$ from the cup product, called the \emph{cohomology basis graph}. We show that $\Gamma_{\mathcal B}$ always contains $\Gamma$ as a subgraph. This provides an effective way to reconstruct the defining graph $\Gamma$ from the cohomology of $A(\Gamma)$, to characterize the planarity of the defining graph from the algebra of $A(\Gamma)$, and to recover many other natural graph-theoretic invariants. We also investigate the behavior of the cohomology basis graph under passage to elementary subminors, and show that it is not well-behaved under edge contraction.</description>
