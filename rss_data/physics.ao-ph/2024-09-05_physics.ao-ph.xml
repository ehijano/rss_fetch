      <title>Machine Learning Framework for High-Resolution Air Temperature Downscaling Using LiDAR-Derived Urban Morphological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate models lack the necessary resolution for urban climate studies, requiring computationally intensive processes to estimate high resolution air temperatures. In contrast, Data-driven approaches offer faster and more accurate air temperature downscaling. This study presents a data-driven framework for downscaling air temperature using publicly available outputs from urban climate models, specifically datasets generated by UrbClim. The proposed framework utilized morphological features extracted from LiDAR data. To extract urban morphological features, first a three-dimensional building model was created using LiDAR data and deep learning models. Then, these features were integrated with meteorological parameters such as wind, humidity, etc., to downscale air temperature using machine learning algorithms. The results demonstrated that the developed framework effectively extracted urban morphological features from LiDAR data. Deep learning algorithms played a crucial role in generating three-dimensional models for extracting the aforementioned features. Also, the evaluation of air temperature downscaling results using various machine learning models indicated that the LightGBM model had the best performance with an RMSE of 0.352{\deg}K and MAE of 0.215{\deg}K. Furthermore, the examination of final air temperature maps derived from downscaling showed that the developed framework successfully estimated air temperatures at higher resolutions, enabling the identification of local air temperature patterns at street level.

      <title>A two-way coupled high resolution wave hindcast for the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we performed a 53-year wave hindcast (1970-2022) for a significant portion of the South China Sea (SCS) with an unstructured mesh that reaches considerably high resolution along the coasts of the Guangdong province (China). The adopted modeling approach is based on the fully two-way coupled SCHISM-WWMIII numerical suite. The model was forced with ERA5 wind velocities that were compared to IFREMER altimeter wind velocities and then bias-corrected for a more accurate treatment of the wind component. Eight major tidal harmonics extracted from FES2014 were imposed to the open boundaries. After a preliminary mesh independence analysis, the model results have been validated against satellite altimeter observations retrieved from the European Space Agency database spanning the period from 1992 to 2019. Moreover, 28 year in-situ measurements from two coastal wave buoys and data from four tidal gauge stations (approximately 20 years) were used to test the nearshore skills of the model. Several statistical indicators have been used to evaluate the offshore and nearshore performance of the model results in terms of the main wave parameters (significant wave height, peak wave period, mean wave direction) and water levels. All statistical metrics suggest that the present hindcast improved the predictions of waves and water levels compared to previous datasets, especially in the coastal regions. The high spatial resolution together with a full coupling allowed the model to capture and simulate processes that are induced by the non-linear interactions between waves and currents, especially nearshore.</description>

      <title>Regional data-driven weather modeling with a global stretched-grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven model (DDM) suitable for regional weather forecasting applications is presented. The model extends the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System by introducing a stretched-grid architecture that dedicates higher resolution over a regional area of interest and maintains a lower resolution elsewhere on the globe. The model is based on graph neural networks, which naturally affords arbitrary multi-resolution grid configurations.
  The model is applied to short-range weather prediction for the Nordics, producing forecasts at 2.5 km spatial and 6 h temporal resolution. The model is pre-trained on 43 years of global ERA5 data at 31 km resolution and is further refined using 3.3 years of 2.5 km resolution operational analyses from the MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS). The performance of the model is evaluated using surface observations from measurement stations across Norway and is compared to short-range weather forecasts from MEPS. The DDM outperforms both the control run and the ensemble mean of MEPS for 2 m temperature. The model also produces competitive precipitation and wind speed forecasts, but is shown to underestimate extreme events.</description>

      <title>PuYun: Medium-Range Global Weather Forecasting Using Large Kernel Attention Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is essential for understanding and mitigating weather-related impacts. In this paper, we present PuYun, an autoregressive cascade model that leverages large kernel attention convolutional networks. The model's design inherently supports extended weather prediction horizons while broadening the effective receptive field. The integration of large kernel attention mechanisms within the convolutional layers enhances the model's capacity to capture fine-grained spatial details, thereby improving its predictive accuracy for meteorological phenomena.
  We introduce PuYun, comprising PuYun-Short for 0-5 day forecasts and PuYun-Medium for 5-10 day predictions. This approach enhances the accuracy of 10-day weather forecasting. Through evaluation, we demonstrate that PuYun-Short alone surpasses the performance of both GraphCast and FuXi-Short in generating accurate 10-day forecasts. Specifically, on the 10th day, PuYun-Short reduces the RMSE for Z500 to 720 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 732 $m^2/s^2$ for GraphCast and 740 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi-Short. Additionally, the RMSE for T2M is reduced to 2.60 K, compared to 2.63 K for GraphCast and 2.65 K for FuXi-Short. Furthermore, when employing a cascaded approach by integrating PuYun-Short and PuYun-Medium, our method achieves superior results compared to the combined performance of FuXi-Short and FuXi-Medium. On the 10th day, the RMSE for Z500 is further reduced to 638 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 641 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our model ensemble in advancing medium-range weather prediction. Our training code and model will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Generation Model of a Spatially Limited Vortex in a Stratified Unstable Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model for the generation of axisymmetric concentrated vortices. The solution of a nonlinear equation for internal gravity waves in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The corresponding expressions describing the dependences on the radius for the radial and vertical velocity components in the inner and outer regions of the vortex include combinations of Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. The proposed new nonlinear analytical model makes it possible to study the structure and nonlinear dynamics of vortices in the radial and vertical regions. The vortex is limited in height. The maximum vertical velocity component is reached at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the axis, and above it, an outflow occurs. The resulting instability in the stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical velocity components according to the hyperbolic sine law, which turns into exponential growth. The characteristic growth time is determined by the inverse growth rate of the instability. The formation of vortices with finite velocity components, which increase with time, is analyzed. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial perturbation and can change with height. The maximum rotation is reached at a certain height. The growth of the azimuth velocity occurs according to a super-exponential law.</description>
