      <title>Determined blind source separation via modeling adjacent frequency band correlations in speech signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multichannel blind source separation (MBSS), which focuses on separating signals of interest from mixed observations, has been extensively studied in acoustic and speech processing. Existing MBSS algorithms, such as independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) and multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF), utilize the low-rank structure of source models but assume that frequency bins are independent. In contrast, independent vector analysis (IVA) does not rely on a low-rank source model but rather captures frequency dependencies based on a uniform correlation assumption. In this work, we demonstrate that dependencies between adjacent frequency bins are significantly stronger than those between bins that are farther apart in typical speech signals. To address this, we introduce a weighted Sinkhorn divergence-based ILRMA (wsILRMA) that simultaneously captures these inter-frequency dependencies and models joint probability distributions. Our approach incorporates an inter-frequency correlation constraint, leading to improved source separation performance compared to existing methods, as evidenced by higher Signal-to-Distortion Ratios (SDRs) and Source-to-Interference Ratios (SIRs).</description>

      <title>Formula-Supervised Sound Event Detection: Pre-Training Without Real Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) framework for pre-training an environmental sound analysis model by leveraging acoustic signals parametrically synthesized through formula-driven methods. Specifically, we outline detailed procedures and evaluate their effectiveness for sound event detection (SED). The SED task, which involves estimating the types and timings of sound events, is particularly challenged by the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient quantity of accurately labeled training data. Moreover, it is well known that manually annotated labels often contain noises and are significantly influenced by the subjective judgment of annotators. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pre-training method that utilizes a synthetic dataset, Formula-SED, where acoustic data are generated solely based on mathematical formulas. The proposed method enables large-scale pre-training by using the synthesis parameters applied at each time step as ground truth labels, thereby eliminating label noise and bias. We demonstrate that large-scale pre-training with Formula-SED significantly enhances model accuracy and accelerates training, as evidenced by our results in the DESED dataset used for DCASE2023 Challenge Task 4.

      <title>LoopGen: Training-Free Loopable Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04466v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.</description>

      <title>Activation Patching for Interpretable Steering in Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how large audio models represent music, and using that understanding to steer generation, is both challenging and underexplored. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability in language models, where direction vectors in transformer residual streams are key to model analysis and control, we investigate similar techniques in the audio domain. This paper presents the first study of latent direction vectors in large audio models and their use for continuous control of musical attributes in text-to-music generation. Focusing on binary concepts like tempo (fast vs. slow) and timbre (bright vs. dark), we compute steering vectors using the difference-in-means method on curated prompt sets. These vectors, scaled by a coefficient and injected into intermediate activations, allow fine-grained modulation of specific musical traits while preserving overall audio quality. We analyze the effect of steering strength, compare injection strategies, and identify layers with the greatest influence. Our findings highlight the promise of direction-based steering as a more mechanistic and interpretable approach to controllable music generation.</description>

      <title>Diff-SSL-G-Comp: Towards a Large-Scale and Diverse Dataset for Virtual Analog Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Analog (VA) modeling aims to simulate the behavior of hardware circuits via algorithms to replicate their tone digitally. Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) is an audio processing module that controls the dynamics of a track by reducing and amplifying the volumes of loud and quiet sounds, which is essential in music production. In recent years, neural-network-based VA modeling has shown great potential in producing high-fidelity models. However, due to the lack of data quantity and diversity, their generalization ability in different parameter settings and input sounds is still limited. To tackle this problem, we present Diff-SSL-G-Comp, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for modeling the SSL 500 G-Bus Compressor. Specifically, we manually collected 175 unmastered songs from the Cambridge Multitrack Library. We recorded the compressed audio in 220 parameter combinations, resulting in an extensive 2528-hour dataset with diverse genres, instruments, tempos, and keys. Moreover, to facilitate the use of our proposed dataset, we conducted benchmark experiments in various open-sourced black-box and grey-box models, as well as white-box plugins. We also conducted ablation studies in different data subsets to illustrate the effectiveness of improved data diversity and quantity. The dataset and demos are on our project page: http://www.yichenggu.com/DiffSSLGComp/.</description>

      <title>One Quantizer is Enough: Toward a Lightweight Audio Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have recently gained traction for their ability to compress high-fidelity audio and generate discrete tokens that can be utilized in downstream generative modeling tasks. However, leading approaches often rely on resource-intensive models and multi-quantizer architectures, resulting in considerable computational overhead and constrained real-world applicability. In this paper, we present SQCodec, a lightweight neural audio codec that leverages a single quantizer to address these limitations. SQCodec explores streamlined convolutional networks and local Transformer modules, alongside TConv, a novel mechanism designed to capture acoustic variations across multiple temporal scales, thereby enhancing reconstruction fidelity while reducing model complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that SQCodec achieves audio quality comparable to multi-quantizer baselines, while its single-quantizer design offers enhanced adaptability and its lightweight architecture reduces resource consumption by an order of magnitude.

      <title>Deconstructing Jazz Piano Style Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artistic style has been studied for centuries, and recent advances in machine learning create new possibilities for understanding it computationally. However, ensuring that machine-learning models produce insights aligned with the interests of practitioners and critics remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on musical style, which benefits from a rich theoretical and mathematical analysis tradition. We train a variety of supervised-learning models to identify 20 iconic jazz musicians across a carefully curated dataset of 84 hours of recordings, and interpret their decision-making processes. Our models include a novel multi-input architecture that enables four musical domains (melody, harmony, rhythm, and dynamics) to be analysed separately. These models enable us to address fundamental questions in music theory and also advance the state-of-the-art in music performer identification (94% accuracy across 20 classes). We release open-source implementations of our models and an accompanying web application for exploring musical styles.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Label Potential for Enhanced Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to integrate various modalities to predict emotional states accurately. However, most current research focuses solely on the fusion of audio and text features, overlooking the valuable information in emotion labels. This oversight could potentially hinder the performance of existing methods, as emotion labels harbor rich, insightful information that could significantly aid MER. We introduce a novel model called Label Signal-Guided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (LSGMER) to overcome this limitation. This model aims to fully harness the power of emotion label information to boost the classification accuracy and stability of MER. Specifically, LSGMER employs a Label Signal Enhancement module that optimizes the representation of modality features by interacting with audio and text features through label embeddings, enabling it to capture the nuances of emotions precisely. Furthermore, we propose a Joint Objective Optimization(JOO) approach to enhance classification accuracy by introducing the Attribution-Prediction Consistency Constraint (APC), which strengthens the alignment between fused features and emotion categories. Extensive experiments conducted on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed LSGMER model.</description>

      <title>P2Mark: Plug-and-play Parameter-intrinsic Watermarking for Neural Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a large number of advanced neural speech generation methods have emerged in the open-source community. Although this has facilitated the application and development of technology, it has also increased the difficulty of preventing the abuse of generated speech and protecting copyrights. Audio watermarking technology is an effective method for proactively protecting generated speech, but when the source codes and model weights of the neural speech generation methods are open-sourced, audio watermarks based on previous watermarking methods can be easily removed or manipulated. This paper proposes a Plug-and-play Parameter-intrinsic WaterMarking (P2Mark) method for neural speech generation system protection. The main advantage of P2Mark is that the watermark information is flexibly integrated into the neural speech generation model in the form of parameters by training a watermark adapter rather than injecting the watermark into the model in the form of features. After the watermark adapter with the watermark embedding is merged with the pre-trained generation model, the watermark information cannot be easily removed or manipulated. Therefore, P2Mark will be a reliable choice for proactively tracing and protecting the copyrights of neural speech generation models in open-source white-box scenarios. We validated P2Mark on two main types of decoders in neural speech generation: vocoder and codec. Experimental results show that P2Mark achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art audio watermarking methods that cannot be used for open-source white-box protection scenarios in terms of watermark extraction accuracy, watermark imperceptibility, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Continuous Boostlet Transform and Associated Uncertainty Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Boostlet Transform (CBT) is introduced as a powerful tool for analyzing spatiotemporal signals, particularly acoustic wavefields. Overcoming the limitations of classical wavelets, the CBT leverages the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations to capture sparse features of natural acoustic fields. This paper presents the mathematical framework of the CBT, including its definition, fundamental properties, and associated uncertainty principles, such as Heisenberg's, logarithmic, Pitt's, and Nazarov's inequalities. These results illuminate the trade-offs between time and frequency localization in the boostlet domain. Practical examples with constant and exponential functions highlight the CBT's adaptability. With applications in radar, communications, audio processing, and seismic analysis, the CBT offers flexible time-frequency resolution, making it ideal for non-stationary and transient signals, and a valuable tool for modern signal processing.</description>

      <title>VocalNet: Speech LLM with Multi-Token Prediction for Faster and High-Quality Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent research focus in speech processing. We propose VocalNet-1B and VocalNet-8B, a series of high-performance, low-latency speech LLMs enabled by a scalable and model-agnostic training framework for real-time voice interaction. Departing from the conventional next-token prediction (NTP), we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP), a novel approach optimized for speech LLMs that simultaneously improves generation speed and quality. Experiments show that VocalNet outperforms mainstream Omni LLMs despite using significantly less training data, while also surpassing existing open-source speech LLMs by a substantial margin. To support reproducibility and community advancement, we will open-source all model weights, inference code, training data, and framework implementations upon publication.</description>

      <title>Selective Masking Adversarial Attack on Automatic Speech Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive research has shown that Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are vulnerable to audio adversarial attacks. Current attacks mainly focus on single-source scenarios, ignoring dual-source scenarios where two people are speaking simultaneously. To bridge the gap, we propose a Selective Masking Adversarial attack, namely SMA attack, which ensures that one audio source is selected for recognition while the other audio source is muted in dual-source scenarios. To better adapt to the dual-source scenario, our SMA attack constructs the normal dual-source audio from the muted audio and selected audio. SMA attack initializes the adversarial perturbation with a small Gaussian noise and iteratively optimizes it using a selective masking optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SMA attack can generate effective and imperceptible audio adversarial examples in the dual-source scenario, achieving an average success rate of attack of 100% and signal-to-noise ratio of 37.15dB on Conformer-CTC, outperforming the baselines.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Speaker Tracking: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speaker tracking has drawn increasing attention over the past few years due to its academic values and wide applications. Audio and visual modalities can provide complementary information for localization and tracking. With audio and visual information, the Bayesian-based filter and deep learning-based methods can solve the problem of data association, audio-visual fusion and track management. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive overview of audio-visual speaker tracking. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive survey over the past five years. We introduce the family of Bayesian filters and summarize the methods for obtaining audio-visual measurements. In addition, the existing trackers and their performance on the AV16.3 dataset are summarized. In the past few years, deep learning techniques have thrived, which also boost the development of audio-visual speaker tracking. The influence of deep learning techniques in terms of measurement extraction and state estimation is also discussed. Finally, we discuss the connections between audio-visual speaker tracking and other areas such as speech separation and distributed speaker tracking.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to refined source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. The proposed method comprises three stages. The first stage is initial tracking, which tracks each sound source from the audio mixture based on the source signal envelope estimation. These tracking results may lack sufficient accuracy. The second stage involves mutual facilitation: Sound separation is conducted using preliminary sound source tracking results. Subsequently, sound source tracking is performed on the separated signals, thereby refining the tracking precision. The refined trajectories further improve separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be iterated multiple times. In the third stage, a neural beamformer estimates precise single-channel separation results based on the refined tracking trajectories and multi-channel separation outputs. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberant conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on refined tracking results.</description>

      <title>FlowMAC: Conditional Flow Matching for Audio Coding at Low Bit Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces FlowMAC, a novel neural audio codec for high-quality general audio compression at low bit rates based on conditional flow matching (CFM). FlowMAC jointly learns a mel spectrogram encoder, quantizer and decoder. At inference time the decoder integrates a continuous normalizing flow via an ODE solver to generate a high-quality mel spectrogram. This is the first time that a CFM-based approach is applied to general audio coding, enabling a scalable, simple and memory efficient training. Our subjective evaluations show that FlowMAC at 3 kbps achieves similar quality as state-of-the-art GAN-based and DDPM-based neural audio codecs at double the bit rate. Moreover, FlowMAC offers a tunable inference pipeline, which permits to trade off complexity and quality. This enables real-time coding on CPU, while maintaining high perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation Through Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.</description>

      <title>CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks. The code for reproducing main experiments is available at https://github.com/Radiant0726/CBW</description>

      <title>ValSub: Subsampling Validation Data to Mitigate Forgetting during ASR Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is widely used within consumer devices such as mobile phones. Recently, personalization or on-device model fine-tuning has shown that adaptation of ASR models towards target user speech improves their performance over rare words or accented speech. Despite these gains, fine-tuning on user data (target domain) risks the personalized model to forget knowledge about its original training distribution (source domain) i.e. catastrophic forgetting, leading to subpar general ASR performance. A simple and efficient approach to combat catastrophic forgetting is to measure forgetting via a validation set that represents the source domain distribution. However, such validation sets are large and impractical for mobile devices. Towards this, we propose a novel method to subsample a substantially large validation set into a smaller one while maintaining the ability to estimate forgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of such a dataset in mitigating forgetting by utilizing it to dynamically determine the number of ideal fine-tuning epochs. When measuring the deviations in per user fine-tuning epochs against a 50x larger validation set (oracle), our method achieves a lower mean-absolute-error (3.39) compared to randomly selected subsets of the same size (3.78-8.65). Unlike random baselines, our method consistently tracks the oracle's behaviour across three different forgetting thresholds.</description>
