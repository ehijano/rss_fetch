      <title>Non-traditional Cartan subalgebras in twisted groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-known work of Renault shows that if $\mathcal{E}$ is a twist over a second countable, effective, \'etale groupoid $G$, then there is a naturally associated Cartan subalgebra of the reduced twisted groupoid C*-algebra $C^*_{r}(G;\mathcal{E})$, and that every Cartan subalgebra of a separable C*-algebra arises in this way. However twists over non-effective groupoids can also possess Cartan subalgebras. For twists over \'etale groupoids built from continuous 2-cocycles, this was shown in work by the first author with Gillaspy, Norton, Reznikoff, and Wright. In this paper, we extend those results to general twists over \'etale groupoids. In particular, we prove that certain clopen subgroupoids of locally compact, Hausdorff, \'etale groupoids give rise to Cartan subalgebras in the twisted groupoid C*-algebra.</description>

      <title>Admissibility of C*-Covers for Operator Algebra Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize when a C*-cover admits a C*-dynamical extension of dynamics on an operator algebra in terms of the boundary ideal structure for the operator algebra in its maximal representation and show that the C*-covers that admit such an extension form a complete lattice. We study dynamical systems arising from groups acting via inner automorphisms in a C*-cover and produce an example of a C*-cover that admits no extension of dynamics on a finite-dimensional non-self-adjoint operator algebra. We construct a partial action on a class of C*-covers that recovers the crossed product of an operator algebra as a subalgebra of the partial crossed product, even when the C*-cover admits no dynamical extension.</description>

      <title>SAT actions of discrete quantum groups and minimal injective extensions of their von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural generalization of the notion of strongly approximately transitive (SAT) states for actions of locally compact quantum groups. In the case of discrete quantum groups of Kac type, we show that the existence of unique stationary SAT states entails rigidity results concerning injective extensions of quantum group von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>On the (Local) Lifting Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (Local) Lifting Property ((L)LP) is introduced by Kirchberg and deals with lifting completely positive maps. We give a characterization of the (L)LP in terms of lifting $\ast$-homomorphisms. We use it to prove that if $A$ and $B$ have the LP and $F$ is their finite-dimensional C*-subalgebra, then $A\ast_F B$ has the LP. This answers a question of Ozawa.
  We prove that Exel's soft tori have the LP. As a consequence we obtain that $C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ is inductive limit of RFD C*-algebras with the LP.
  We prove that for a class of C*-algebras including $C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ and all contractible C*-algebras, the LLP is equivalent to Ext being a group.
  As byproduct of methods developed in the paper we generalize Kirchberg's theorem about extensions with the WEP, give short proofs of several, old and new, facts about soft tori, new unified proofs of Li and Shen's characterization of RFD property of free products amalgamated over a finite-dimensional subalgebra and Blackadar's characterization of semiprojectivity of them.</description>

      <title>Maximal ideals of reduced group C*-algebras and Thompson's groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a conditional expectation $P$ from a C*-algebra $B$ onto a C*-subalgebra $A$, we observe that induction of ideals via $P$, together with a map which we call co-induction, forms a Galois connection between the lattices of ideals of $A$ and $B$. Using properties of this Galois connection, we show that, given a discrete group $G$ and a stabilizer subgroup $G_x$ for the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary, induction gives a bijection between the set of maximal co-induced ideals of $C^*(G_x)$ and the set of maximal ideals of $C^*_r(G)$.
  As an application, we prove that the reduced C*-algebra of Thompson's group $T$ has a unique maximal ideal. Furthermore, we show that, if Thompson's group $F$ is amenable, then $C^*_r(T)$ has infinitely many ideals.</description>

      <title>Almost invariant CND kernels and proper uniformly Lipschitz actions on subspaces of $L^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12949v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of almost invariant conditionally negative definite kernel and use it to give a characterisation of groups admitting a proper uniformly Lipschitz affine action on a subspace of an $L^1$ space. We show that this condition is satisfied by groups acting properly on products of quasi-trees, weakly amenable groups with Cowling-Haagerup constant 1, and a-TTT-menable groups.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Proof that Many Groups with Non-Torsion 2-Cohomology are Not Matricially Stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete group is matricially stable if every function from the group to a complex unitary group that is "almost multiplicative" in the point-operator norm topology is "close" to a genuine unitary representation. It follows from a recent result due to Dadarlat that all amenable, groups with non-torsion integral 2-cohomology are not matricially stable, but the proof does not lead to explicit examples of asymptotic representations that are not perturbable to genuine representations. The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit formula, in terms of cohomological data, for asymptotic representations that are not perturbable to genuine representations for a class of groups that contains all finitely generated groups with a non-torsion 2-cohomology class that corresponds to a central extension where the middle group is residually finite. This class includes polycyclic groups with non-torsion 2-cohomology.</description>
