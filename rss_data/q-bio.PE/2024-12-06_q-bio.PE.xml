      <title>Information Geometry for Maximum Diversity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, biodiversity measures have gained prominence as essential tools for ecological and environmental assessments, particularly in the context of increasingly complex and large-scale datasets. We provide a comprehensive review of diversity measures, including the Gini-Simpson index, Hill numbers, and Rao's quadratic entropy, examining their roles in capturing various aspects of biodiversity. Among these, Rao's quadratic entropy stands out for its ability to incorporate not only species abundance but also functional and genetic dissimilarities. The paper emphasizes the statistical and ecological significance of Rao's quadratic entropy under the information geometry framework. We explore the distribution maximizing such a diversity measure under linear constraints that reflect ecological realities, such as resource competition or habitat suitability. Furthermore, we discuss a unified approach of the Leinster-Cobbold index combining Hill numbers and Rao's entropy, allowing for an adaptable and similarity-sensitive measure of biodiversity.
  Finally, we discuss the information geometry associated with the maximum diversity distribution focusing on the cross diversity measures such as the cross-entropy.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale phylodynamic modelling of rapid punctuated pathogen evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational multi-scale pandemic modelling remains a major and timely challenge. Here we identify specific requirements for a new class of pandemic models operating across three scales: (1) rapid pathogen evolution, punctuated by emergence of new variants, (2) human interactions within a heterogeneous population, and (3) public health responses which constrain individual actions to control the disease transmission. We then present a pandemic modelling framework satisfying these requirements and capable of simulating multi-scale dynamic feedback loops. The developed framework comprises a stochastic agent-based model of pandemic spread, coupled with a phylodynamic model of the within-host pathogen evolution. It is validated with a case study, modelling a rapid punctuated evolution of SARS-CoV-2, based on global and contemporary genomic surveillance data, during the COVID-19 transmission within a large heterogeneous population. We demonstrate that the model captures the essential features of the COVID-19 pandemic and the novel coronavirus evolution, while retaining computational tractability and scalability.</description>
