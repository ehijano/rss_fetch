      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Minimal Matroid Extensions and Irreducible Decompositions of Circuit Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method for decomposing the circuit variety of a given matroid $M$, based on an algorithm that identifies its minimal extensions. These extensions correspond to the smallest elements above $M$ in the poset defined by the dependency order. We apply our algorithm to several classical configurations: the V\'amos matroid, the unique Steiner quadruple system $S(3,4,8)$, the projective and affine planes, the dual of the Fano matroid, and the dual of the graphic matroid of $K_{3,3}$. In each case, we compute the minimal irreducible decomposition of their circuit varieties.</description>

      <title>On deciding transcendence of power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that algebraic power series are differentially finite (D-finite): they satisfy linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. The converse problem, whether a given D-finite power series is algebraic or transcendental, is notoriously difficult. We prove that this problem is decidable: we give two theoretical algorithms and a transcendence test that is efficient in practice.</description>

      <title>Projective Variety Recovery from Unknown Linear Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a smooth irreducible algebraic variety $X$ of dimension $n$ embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ (with $m \geq n+2$), which degree is $d$, can be recovered using two projections from unknown points onto unknown hyperplanes. The centers and the hyperplanes of projection are unknown: the only input is the defining equations of each projected varieties. We show how both the projection operators and the variety in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ can be recovered modulo some action of the group of projective transformations of $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$. This configuration generalizes results obtained in the context of curves embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^3$ and results concerning surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^4$.
  We show how in a generic situation, a characteristic matrix of the pair of projections can be recovered. In the process we address dimensional issues and as a result establish a necessary condition, as well as a sufficient condition to compute this characteristic matrix up to a finite-fold ambiguity. These conditions are expressed as minimal values of the degree of the dual variety.
  Then we use this matrix to recover the class of the couple of projections and as a consequence to recover the variety. For a generic situation, two projections define a variety with two irreducible components. One component has degree $d(d-1)$ and the other has degree $d$, being the original variety.</description>

      <title>Certifying solutions of degenerate semidefinite programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the exact method failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Error Detection and Constraint Recovery in Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification without Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC), particularly neurosymbolic-based approaches, have demonstrated improved consistency and accuracy by enforcing constraints on a neural model during training. However, such work assumes the existence of such constraints a-priori. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and present an approach based on Error Detection Rules (EDR) that allow for learning explainable rules about the failure modes of machine learning models. We show that these rules are not only effective in detecting when a machine learning classifier has made an error but also can be leveraged as constraints for HMC, thereby allowing the recovery of explainable constraints even if they are not provided. We show that our approach is effective in detecting machine learning errors and recovering constraints, is noise tolerant, and can function as a source of knowledge for neurosymbolic models on multiple datasets, including a newly introduced military vehicle recognition dataset.</description>
