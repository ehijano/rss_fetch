      <title>Towards early-type eclipsing binaries as extragalactic milestones: III. Physical properties of the O-type eclipsing binary OGLE LMC-ECL-21568 in a quadruple system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from a complex study of an eclipsing O-type binary (Aa+Ab) with the orbital period $P_{A}=3.2254367$ days, that forms part of a higher-order multiple system in a configuration (A+B)+C. We derived masses of the Aa+Ab binary $M_{1}= 19.02 \pm 0.12 \,M_\odot$, $M_{2}= 17.50 \pm 0.13 \,M_\odot$, radii $R_{1}= 7.70 \pm 0.05 \,R_\odot$, $R_{2}= 6.64 \pm 0.06 \,R_\odot$, and temperatures $T_1 = 34250 \pm 500 $ K, $T_2 = 33750 \pm 500 $ K. From the analysis of radial velocities, we found a spectroscopic orbit of A in the outer A+B system with $P_{A+B}=195.8$ days ($P_{A+B}/P_{A}\approx 61$). In the O-C analysis, we confirmed this orbit and found another component orbiting the A+B system with $P_{AB+C}=2550$ days ($P_{AB+C}\,/P_{A+B}\approx 13$). From the total mass of the inner binary and its outer orbit, we estimated the mass of the third object, $M_B \gtrsim 10.7 M_\odot$. From the light-travel time effect fit to the O-C data, we obtained the limit for the mass of the fourth component, $M_C \gtrsim 7.3 M_\odot$. These extra components contribute to about 20% to 30% (increasing with wavelength) of the total system light. From the comparison of model spectra with the multiband photometry, we derived a distance modulus of 18.59 $\pm$ 0.06 mag, a reddening of 0.16 $\pm$ 0.02 mag, and an $R_V$ of $3.2$. This work is part of our ongoing project, which aims to calibrate the surface brightness-color relation for early-type stars.</description>

      <title>Detecting New Visual Binaries in Gaia DR3 with Gaia and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Photometry II. Speckle Observations of 16 Low-Separation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present speckle observations of 16 low-separation ($s&lt;30$ AU) high probability candidate binaries from the catalog by Medan et al., where secondaries typically lack astrometric solutions in Gaia. From these speckle observations, we find a second component is always detected within the field of view. To determine if the detection is consistent with a physical companion or a chance alignment with a background source, we utilize a statistic from Tokovinin &amp; Kiyaeva that compares the apparent motion of the systems to the expected orbital motion ($\mu^\prime$). Using simulated binary orbits, we construct likelihood distributions of $\mu^\prime$ assuming various total errors on the measurements. With the hypothesis that the system is a true binary, we show that large measurement errors can result in $\mu^\prime$ values higher than expected for bound systems. Using simulated chance alignments, we also create similar likelihoods to test this alternative hypothesis. By combining likelihoods of both true binaries and chance alignments, we find that 15 of the 16 candidates are physical systems regardless of the level of measurement error. Our findings also accommodate all 16 as physical systems if the average, relative measurement error on the binary separations and position angles is $\sim4.3\%$, which is consistent with our knowledge of the Gaia and Gemini speckle pipelines. Importantly, beyond assessing the likelihood of a true binary vs. chance alignment, this quantitative assessment of the true average measurement error will allow more robust error estimates of mass determinations from short separation binaries with Gaia and/or Gemini speckle data.</description>

      <title>The Independence of Magnetic Turbulent Power Spectra to the Presence of Switchbacks in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An outstanding gap in our knowledge of the solar wind is the relationship between switchbacks and solar wind turbulence. Switchbacks are large fluctuations, even reversals, of the background magnetic field embedded in the solar wind flow. It has been proposed that switchbacks may form as a product of turbulence and decay via coupling with the turbulent cascade. In this work, we examine how properties of solar wind magnetic field turbulence vary in the presence or absence of switchbacks. Specifically, we use in-situ particle and fields measurements from Parker Solar Probe to measure magnetic field turbulent wave power, separately in the inertial and kinetic ranges, as a function of switchback magnetic deflection angle. We demonstrate that the angle between the background magnetic field and the solar wind velocity in the spacecraft frame ($\theta_{vB}$) strongly determines whether Parker Solar Probe samples wave power parallel or perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Further, we show that $\theta_{vB}$ is strongly modulated by the switchback magnetic deflection angle. In this analysis, we demonstrate that switchback deflection angle does not correspond to any significant increase in wave power in either the inertial range or at kinetic scales. This result implies that switchbacks do not strongly couple to the turbulent cascade in the inertial or kinetic ranges via turbulent wave-particle interactions. Therefore, we do not expect switchbacks to contribute significantly to solar wind heating through this type of energy conversion pathway, although contributions via other mechanisms, such as magnetic reconnection may still be significant.</description>

      <title>Negative-energy waves in the vertical threads of a solar prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar prominences, intricate structures on the Sun's limb, have been a subject of fascination due to their thread-like features and dynamic behaviors. Utilizing data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), Chinese H_alpha Solar Explorer (CHASE), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), this study investigates the transverse swaying motions observed in the vertical threads of a solar prominence during its eruption onset on May 11, 2023. The transverse swaying motions were observed to propagate upward, accompanied by upflowing materials at an inclination of 31 degrees relative to the plane of the sky. These motions displayed small-amplitude oscillations with corrected velocities of around 3-4 km/s and periods of 13-17 minutes. Over time, the oscillations of swaying motion exhibited an increasing pattern in displacement amplitudes, oscillatory periods, and projected velocity amplitudes. Their phase velocities are estimated to be about 26-34 km/s. An important finding is that these oscillations'phase velocities are comparable to the upward flow velocities, measured to be around 30-34 km/s. We propose that this phenomenon is associated with negative-energy wave instabilities, which require comparable velocities of the waves and flows, as indicated by our findings. This phenomenon may contribute to the instability and observed disruption of the prominence. By using prominence seismology, the Alfven speed and magnetic field strength of the vertical threads have been estimated to be approximately 21.5 km/s and 2 Gauss, respectively. This study reveals the dynamics and magnetic properties of solar prominences, contributing to our understanding of their behavior in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{globin}$: A spectropolarimetric inversion code for the coupled inference of atomic line parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many transitions, atomic data, such as the oscillator strength (log(gf)) and the central wavelength of the line, are poorly constrained or even unknown. We present and test a new inversion method that infers atomic line parameters and the height stratification of the atmospheric parameters from spatially resolved spectropolarimetric observations of the Sun. This method is implemented in the new inversion code $\texttt{globin}$. The new method imposes a spatial coupling in inversion parameters common to all pixels, such as the atomic parameters of the observed spectral lines, and infers atmospheric parameters for each spatial pixel individually. The uniqueness of this method lies in its ability to retrieve reliable atomic parameters even for heavily blended spectral lines. We tested the method by applying it to a set of 18 spectral lines between 4015 \r{A} and 4017 \r{A}, synthesized from a 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation containing a sunspot and the quiet Sun region around it. The results were then compared with a previously used inversion method where atomic parameters were determined for every pixel independently (pixel-by-pixel method). The new method was able to retrieve the log(gf) values of all lines to an accuracy of 0.004 dex, while the pixel-by-pixel method retrieved the same parameter to an accuracy of only 0.025 dex. The largest differences between the two methods are evident for the heavily blended lines, with the former method performing better than the latter. In addition, the new method is also able to infer reliable atmospheric parameters in all the inverted pixels by successfully disentangling the degeneracies between the atomic and atmospheric parameters. The new method is well suited for the reliable determination of both atomic and atmospheric parameters and works well on all spectral lines, including those that are weak and/or severely blended.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Analysis of Limited-r Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In recent years, the R-Process Alliance (RPA) has conducted a successful search for stars enhanced in elements produced by the rapid neutron-capture (r-)process. In particular, the RPA has uncovered a number of stars strongly enriched in light r-process elements, such as Sr, Y and Zr, the so-called limited-r stars, in order to investigate the astrophysical production site(s) of these elements. Aims. With this paper, we aim to investigate the possible formation sites for light neutron-capture elements, by deriving detailed abundances for neutron-capture elements from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of three limited-r stars. Methods. We conducted a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectroscopic abundance analysis of three stars, as well as a kinematic analysis. Further, we calculated the lanthanide mass fraction (XLa) of our stars and of limited-r stars from the literature. Results. We found that the neutron-capture element abundance pattern of limited-r stars behaves differently depending on their [Ba/Eu]] ratios, and suggest that this should be taken into account in future investigations of their abundances. Furthermore, we found that the XLa of limited-r stars is lower than that of the kilonova AT2017gfo. The latter seems to be in the transition zone between limited-r XLa and that of r-I, r-II stars. Finally, we found that, unlike r-I and r-II stars, the current sample of limited-r stars are largely born in the Galaxy rather than being accreted.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Early Dynamics of Solar Coronal Bright Fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of 26 CME-driven compressive waves known as Coronal Bright Fronts (CBFs) observed in the low solar corona between 2010 and 2017. These CBFs have been found to be associated with SEP events near Earth, indicating their importance in understanding space weather phenomena. The aim of this study is to analyze and describe the early dynamics of CBFs using a physics-based heliospheric SEP forecasting system known as the SPREAdFAST framework. This framework utilizes a chain of data-driven analytic and numerical models to predict SEP fluxes at multiple locations in the inner heliosphere by considering their acceleration at CMEs near the Sun and subsequent interplanetary transport. To estimate the time-dependent plasma and compression parameters of the CBFs, we utilized sequences of base-difference images obtained from the AIA instrument on board the SDO satellite, and measurements of the height-time profiles of the CMEs obtained from the LASCO instrument on board the SOHO satellite. We employed kinematic measurements and plasma model results to derive these parameters. The SPREAdFAST framework facilitated the analysis and correlation of these observations with SEP events near Earth. Our analysis yielded statistical relations and distributions for both the shocks and plasma parameters associated with the 26 CBFs investigated. By combining the observations from the AIA and LASCO instruments, as well as the data products from the SPREAdFAST framework, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of the early dynamics of CBFs, including their temporal evolution, plasma properties, and compressional characteristics. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field and have implications for space weather forecasting and the study of SEP events.</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Analysis of Herbig Ae/Be Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars are intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, characterized by infrared excess and emission lines. They are observed to emit X-rays, whose origin is a matter of discussion and not settled yet. X-ray emission is not expected in HAeBe stars, as they lack the sub-surface convective zone. In this study, we retrieved observations from the Chandra archive for 62 HAeBe stars, among which 44 sources (detection fraction $\sim$71%) were detected in X-rays, with 7 being new detections. We use this sample as a test bed to conduct a comparative analysis of the X-ray properties of HAeBe stars and their low-mass counterparts, T Tauri Stars (TTSs). Further, we compare the X-ray properties of HAeBe stars and TTSs with optical and IR properties to constrain the X-ray emission mechanism in HAeBe stars. We found no correlation between X-ray emission and disk properties of HAeBe stars, confirming that X-rays are not related to accretion shocks. About 56% of HAeBe stars without any known sub-arcsec companions have lower plasma temperatures (kT $\leq$ 2 keV). We observe flaring/variability in HAeBe stars with confirmed low-mass companions. These stars show plasma temperatures &gt; 2 keV, similar to TTSs. Guided by this information we discuss the role of a T Tauri companion for X-ray emission seen in our sample of HAeBe stars. From the results obtained in this paper, we suggest that X-ray emission from HAeBe stars may not be related to accretion shocks or hidden TTS, but rather can be due to magnetically driven coronal emission.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of the W-shaped O II Lines in Spectra of Type I Superluminous Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are characterized by O II lines around 4,000 - 4,500 A in pre-/near-maximum spectra, so-called W-shaped O II lines. As these lines are from relatively high excitation levels, they have been considered a sign of non-thermal processes, which may give a hint of power sources of SLSNe-I. However, the conditions for these lines to appear have not been understood well. In this work, we systematically calculate synthetic spectra to reproduce observed spectra of eight SLSNe-I, parameterizing departure coefficients from the nebular approximation in the SN ejecta (expressed as b_neb). We find that most of the observed spectra can be reproduced well with b_neb ~&lt; 10, which means that no strong departure is necessary for the formation of the W-shaped O II lines. We also show that the appearance of the W-shaped O II lines is sensitive to temperature; only spectra with temperatures T ~ 14,000 - 16,000 K can produce the W-shaped O II lines without large departures. Based on this, we constrain the non-thermal ionization rate near the photosphere. Our results suggest that spectral features of SLSNe-I can give independent constraints on the power source through the non-thermal ionization rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino elastic differential cross-section (NDCS) and corresponding mean free path for neutral current scattering in the dense matter of a neutron star. A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <title>Heating of Millisecond Pulsars by Magnetic Field Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are believed to be very old neutron stars (NSs) whose age may exceed significantly $10^8$ yrs. Although cooling scenarios of isolated NSs predict for that age a surface temperature $T_s\sim 10^4$ K, observations of the nearest MSP J0437-4715 indicate $T_s$ well above that value. Besides the heating of the polar cap surface by backflowing charged particles, Joule heating in the crust can contribute to the overall heat budget of MSPs. Since the dipolar field component, derived from $P$ and $\dot{P}$ measurements, is much too weak for remarkable heating, smaller-scale structures should be analysed whether they can supply the demanded heat. For this purpose we study the small scale field structure of radio pulsars. Magnetic field components, significantly stronger than the dipolar one, may exist especially at the surface of MSPs. We assign upper limits to the strength of single field components up to a multipolarity of $l=10$ and the corresponding deviations from axial symmetry $m \le l$. Arguments are provided that the decay of the small-scale components with $l=3$ or $l=4$ of the crustal magnetic field may cause the relatively high surface temperature of isolated MSPs.</description>

      <title>Red Supergiant Candidates for Multimessenger Monitoring of the Next Galactic Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compile a catalog of 578 highly probable and 62 likely red supergiants (RSGs) of the Milky Way, which represents the largest list of Galactic RSG candidates designed for continuous follow-up to date. We match distances measured by Gaia DR3, 2MASS photometry, and a 3D Galactic dust map to obtain luminous bright late-type stars. Determining the stars' bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures, we compare to Geneva stellar evolution tracks to determine likely RSG candidates, and quantify contamination using a catalog of Galactic AGB in the same luminosity-temperature space. We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we study the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Using JWST transits and occultations to determine $\sim1\%$ stellar radii and temperatures of low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using JWST observations of a primary transit and two secondary eclipses for GJ 1214b, we determine an eccentricity that is more precise than a decade of HARPS data, which enables us to measure the stellar density to 2.62%. Coupled with a prior on the stellar mass from a dynamically calibrated K-$M_*$ relation, we determine $R_*$ to 1.13% -- 3 times more precise than any other published analysis of this system. Then, using the bolometric flux from an spectral energy distribution model, we determine $T_{\rm eff}$ to 1.39% -- 40% more precise than systematic floors from spectroscopy. Within the global model, these also improve the planetary radius and insolation. This is a proof of concept for a new method to determine accurate $R_*$ and $T_{\rm eff}$ to a precision currently achieved for only a small number of low-mass stars. By applying our method to all high signal-to-noise ratio planetary transits and occultations, we can expand the sample of precisely measured stars without assuming tidal circularization and calibrate new relations to improve our understanding of all low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Asymmetric Spike-like Structures of the 10 au Disk around the Very Low-luminosity Protostar Embedded in the Taurus Dense Core MC 27/L1521F with ALMA</title>

Abstract: Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations have revealed an increasing number of compact protostellar disks with radii of less than a few tens of astronomical units and that young Class 0/I objects have an intrinsic size diversity. To deepen our understanding of the origin of such tiny disks, we performed the highest-resolution configuration observations with ALMA at a beam size of $\sim$0$''$03 (4 au) on the very low-luminosity Class 0 protostar embedded in the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F. The 1.3 mm continuum measurement successfully resolved a tiny, faint ($\sim$1 mJy) disk with a major axis length of $\sim$10 au, one of the smallest examples in the ALMA protostellar studies. In addition, we detected spike-like components in the northeastern direction at the disk edge. Gravitational instability or other fragmentation mechanisms cannot explain the structures, given the central stellar mass of $\sim$0.2 $M_{\odot}$ and the disk mass of $\gtrsim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$. Instead, we propose that these small spike structures were formed by a recent dynamic magnetic flux transport event due to interchange instability that would be favorable to occur if the parental core has a strong magnetic field. The presence of complex arc-like structures on a larger ($\sim$2000 au) scale in the same direction as the spike structures suggests that the event was not single. Such episodic, dynamical events may play an important role in maintaining the compact nature of the protostellar disk in the complex gas envelope during the main accretion phase.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>
