      <title>Solving MDPs with LTLf+ and PPLTL+ Temporal Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal logics LTLf+ and PPLTL+ have recently been proposed to express objectives over infinite traces. These logics are appealing because they match the expressive power of LTL on infinite traces while enabling efficient DFA-based techniques, which have been crucial to the scalability of reactive synthesis and adversarial planning in LTLf and PPLTL over finite traces. In this paper, we demonstrate that these logics are also highly effective in the context of MDPs. Introducing a technique tailored for probabilistic systems, we leverage the benefits of efficient DFA-based methods and compositionality. This approach is simpler than its non-probabilistic counterparts in reactive synthesis and adversarial planning, as it accommodates a controlled form of nondeterminism (``good for MDPs") in the automata when transitioning from finite to infinite traces. Notably, by exploiting compositionality, our solution is both implementation-friendly and well-suited for straightforward symbolic implementations.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional tilings and MSO logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define sets of coulourings of the infinite discrete plane using monadic second order (MSO) formulas. We determine the complexity of deciding whether such a formula defines a subshift, parametrized on the quantifier alternation complexity of the formula. We also study the complexities of languages of MSO-definable sets, giving either an exact classification or upper and lower bounds for each quantifier alternation class.</description>

      <title>Automated Formal Verification of Area-Optimized Safety Registers in Automotive SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Registers are primary storage elements in System-on-chip~(SoC) designs and play an important role in maintaining state information and processing data in digital systems. With respect to the ISO26262 standard, these registers require high levels of reliability and fault tolerance. For this reason, safety-critical applications require that normal registers are equipped with additional safety components to construct safety registers, which ensure system stability and fault tolerance. However, the process of integrating these safety registers is complex and error-prone, because of highly-configurable features provided by a safety library such as parameterized modules and flexible safety structures. In addition, to address the overhead caused by the safety registers, we have applied area optimization techniques to their implementation. However, this optimization can make the integration process more susceptible to errors. To avoid any integration mistakes, rigorous verification is always required, but it is time-consuming and error-prone if the verification is implemented manually when dealing with numerous verification requests. To address these challenges, we propose an automated flow for the verification of safety registers with the formal approach. The results indicate that this automated verification approach has the potential to reduce the verification effort by more than 80\%. Additionally, it ensures a comprehensive examination of every requirement of this safety library, which is reflected in faster detection of bugs. The proposed framework can be replicated for the verification of other safety components enabling an early detection of potential issues and saving valuable time and resources.</description>

      <title>Automata Learning of Preferences over Temporal Logic Formulas from Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many preference elicitation algorithms consider preference over propositional logic formulas or items with different attributes. In sequential decision making, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of which is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of preference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is represented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences), referred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons between finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals and the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation over temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a preorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference reduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally challenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of size smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being NP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop an algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the minimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We present the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis using a robotic motion planning problem.</description>

      <title>Learning Formal Specifications from Membership and Preference Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active learning is a well-studied approach to learning formal specifications, such as automata. In this work, we extend active specification learning by proposing a novel framework that strategically requests a combination of membership labels and pair-wise preferences, a popular alternative to membership labels. The combination of pair-wise preferences and membership labels allows for a more flexible approach to active specification learning, which previously relied on membership labels only. We instantiate our framework in two different domains, demonstrating the generality of our approach. Our results suggest that learning from both modalities allows us to robustly and conveniently identify specifications via membership and preferences.</description>

      <title>Provably Correct Automata Embeddings for Optimal Automata-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automata-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) has given promising results for learning multi-task policies capable of performing temporally extended objectives given at runtime, done by pretraining and freezing automata embeddings prior to training the downstream policy. However, no theoretical guarantees were given. This work provides a theoretical framework for the automata-conditioned RL problem and shows that it is probably approximately correct learnable. We then present a technique for learning provably correct automata embeddings, guaranteeing optimal multi-task policy learning. Our experimental evaluation confirms these theoretical results.</description>
