      <title>All-electron $BSE@GW$ method with Numeric Atom-Centered Orbitals for Extended Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green's function theory has emerged as a powerful many-body approach not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum chemistry in recent years. We have developed a new all-electron implementation of the BSE@GW formalism using numeric atom-centered orbital basis sets (Liu et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 044105 (2020)). We present our recent developments in implementing this formalism for extended systems with periodic boundary conditions. We discuss its numerical implementation and various convergence tests pertaining to numerical atom-centered orbitals, auxiliary basis sets for the resolution-of-identity formalism, and Brillouin zone sampling. Proof-of-principle examples are presented to compare with other formalisms, illustrating the new all-electron BSE@GW method for extended systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been a cornerstone in computational chemistry, physics, and materials science for decades, benefiting from advancements in computational power and theoretical methods. This paper introduces a novel, cloud-native application, Accelerated DFT, which offers an order of magnitude acceleration in DFT simulations. By integrating state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure and redesigning algorithms for graphic processing units (GPUs), Accelerated DFT achieves high-speed calculations without sacrificing accuracy. It provides an accessible and scalable solution for the increasing demands of DFT calculations in scientific communities.

      <title>Error Control and Automatic Detection of Reference Active Spaces in Many-Body Expanded Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wide-reaching revamp of the generalized many-body expanded full configuration interaction (MBE-FCI) method. First, we outline how to automatize the selection of reference active spaces whereby the inherent bias introduced through a manual identification is reduced, also within the context of traditional complete active space methods. Second, we allow for the use of compact orbital clusters as expansion objects, which works to circumvent the unfavorable scaling with the number of orbitals included in the space complementary to the reference orbitals. Finally, we present a new algorithm for ensuring that many-body expansions can be efficiently terminated while conservatively accounting for resulting errors. These developments are all tested on a variety of molecular systems and different orbital representations to illustrate the abilities of our algorithm to produce correlation energies within predetermined error bounds, significantly broadening the overall applicability of the MBE-FCI method.</description>

      <title>Chemotactic behavior for a self-phoretic Janus particle near a patch source of fuel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological microswimmers are capable of chemotaxis, i.e., they can sense an ambient chemical gradient and adjust their mechanism of motility to move towards or away from the source of the gradient. Synthetic active colloids endowed with chemotactic behavior hold considerable promise for targeted drug delivery and the realization of programmable and reconfigurable materials. Here we study the chemotactic behavior of a Janus particle, which converts ``fuel'' molecules, released at an axisymmetric chemical patch located on a planar wall, into ``product'' molecules at its catalytic cap and moves by self-phoresis induced by the product. The chemotactic behavior is characterized as a function of the interplay between the rates of release (at the patch) and the consumption (at the particle) of fuel, as well as of details of the phoretic response of the particle (i.e., its phoretic mobility). Among others, we find that, under certain conditions, the particle is attracted to a stable ``hovering state'' in which it aligns its axis normal to the wall and rests (positions itself) at an activity-dependent distance above the center of the patch.</description>

      <title>Emergent Wigner phases in moir\'e superlattice from deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice designed in stacked van der Waals material provides a dynamic platform for hosting exotic and emergent condensed matter phenomena. However, the relevance of strong correlation effects and the large size of moir\'e unit cells pose significant challenges for traditional computational techniques. To overcome these challenges, we develop an unsupervised deep learning approach to uncover electronic phases emerging from moir\'e systems based on variational optimization of neural network many-body wavefunction. Our approach has identified diverse quantum states, including novel phases such as generalized Wigner crystals, Wigner molecular crystals, and previously unreported Wigner covalent crystals. These discoveries provide insights into recent experimental studies and suggest new phases for future exploration. They also highlight the crucial role of spin polarization in determining Wigner phases. More importantly, our proposed deep learning approach is proven general and efficient, offering a powerful framework for studying moir\'e physics.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the Transport Properties of Helium Gas at Cryogenic Temperatures Determined Using Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the transport properties, such as diffusivity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity, of 4He at the gaseous phase are computed for state points in the temperature range of 10 K to 150 K and pressure range of 0.10 MPa (1 atm) to 0.21 MPa using classical and quantum frameworks. Within the classical molecular dynamics simulation (MDS), the Green-Kubo (GK) approach is used. The GK method has an inherent uncertainty associated with it due to the random fluctuations in the flux autocorrelation functions. Moreover, in the temperature range of 10 K to 40 K, the quantum nature of the helium gas particles becomes prominent. The classical MDS performed does not include these effects and hence introduces uncertainties in the calculated results. We discuss efficient ways of time averaging the autocorrelation function to reduce statistical fluctuations and perform the quantum scattering phase shift calculations within the Chapman-Cowling theory to study the quantum effects. Furthermore, this study also provides the transport properties data in the cryogenic temperature limit of 10 K to 150 K, which is scarcely studied in the literature and can be applied in complex systems.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced the Alchemical Integral Transform (AIT) enabling the prediction of energy differences, and guessed an Ansatz to parametrize space $\pmb{r}$ in some alchemical change $\lambda$. Here, we present a rigorous derivation of AIT's kernel $\mathcal{K}$ and a rigorous $\pmb{r}(\lambda)$ in $n$ dimensions as long as the target's Hamiltonian can be obtained by an affine transformation of the coordinates from the reference Hamiltonian. Analytical expressions for changes in energy spectra and densities are obtained for general systems defined by (positive) homogeneous functions of degree $\nu \neq -2$ in $n$ dimensions, e.g. the quantum harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen-like atom, saddle functions and double-well-like potentials.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Molecular Simulations of Fabry-P\'erot Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing theoretical frameworks for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) beyond the single-mode approximation is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of experiments with planar Fabry-P\'erot cavities. Herein, a generalized cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) scheme is developed to simulate VSC of a large ensemble of realistic molecules coupled to an arbitrary 1D or 2D photonic environment. This approach is built upon the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian in the normal mode basis and uses a grid representation of the molecular ensembles to reduce the computational cost. When simulating the polariton dispersion relation for a homogeneous distribution of molecules in planar Fabry-P\'erot cavities, our data highlight the importance of preserving the in-plane translational symmetry of the molecular distribution. In this homogeneous limit, CavMD yields the consistent polariton dispersion relation as analytic theory, i.e., incorporating many cavity modes with varying in-plane wave vectors ($k_{\parallel}$) produces the same spectrum as the system with a single cavity mode. Furthermore, CavMD reveals that the validity of the single mode approximation is challenged when nonequilibrium polariton dynamics are considered, as polariton-polariton scattering occurs between modes with nearest neighbor $k_{\parallel}$. The procedure for numerically approaching the macroscopic limit is also demonstrated with CavMD by increasing the system size. Looking forward, our generalized CavMD approach may facilitate understanding vibrational polariton transport and condensation.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Polaritons with Broken In-Plane Translational Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational polaritons form in a planar Fabry-Perot microcavity when a vibrational mode of a layer of molecules is near resonant with an infrared cavity mode. Herein, dispersion relations of vibrational polaritons are studied when the molecular density distribution breaks the macroscopic translational symmetry along the cavity mirror plane. Both perturbative theory and numerical calculations show that, if a homogeneous in-plane molecular distribution is modulated by sinusoidal fluctuations, in addition to a pair of upper and lower polariton branches, a discrete number of side polariton branches may emerge in the polariton dispersion relation. Moreover, for a periodic Gaussian molecular in-plane density distribution, only two, yet significantly broadened polariton branches exist in the spectra. This polariton linewidth broadening is caused by the scattering between cavity modes at neighboring in-plane frequencies due to the symmetry breaking, which is distinguished from known origins of polariton broadening such as the homogeneous broadening of molecules, the cavity loss, or the large energetic disorder of molecules. Associated with the broadened polariton branches, under the periodic Gaussian in-plane inhomogeneity, a significant number of the VSC eigenstates contain a non-zero contribution from the cavity photon mode at zero in-plane frequency, blurring the distinction between the bright and the dark modes. Looking forward, our theoretical investigation should facilitate the experimental exploration of vibrational polaritons with patterned in-plane molecular density distributions.</description>

      <title>Roaming in acetaldehyde</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate roaming in the photodissociation of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), providing insight into the contrasting roaming dynamics observed for this molecule compared to formaldehyde. We carry out trajectory studies for full-dimensional acetaldehyde, supplemented with an analysis of a two degree-of-freedom restricted model and obtain evidence for two distinct roaming pathways. Trajectories exhibit roaming at both shorter (9-11.5 au) and larger (14.5-22.9 au) maximum CH$_3$-HCO separations, characterized by differing amounts of HCO rotation. No roaming trajectories were found in the intervening gap region. The roaming dynamics near 14.5-22.9 au are well-reproduced by the restricted model and involve passage through a centrifugal barrier, analogous to formaldehyde roaming. However, the shorter-range 9-11.5 au roaming appears unique to acetaldehyde, and is likely facilitated by repulsive interactions absent in the simplified models. Phase space analysis reveals that this additional roaming pathway is inaccessible in the reduced dimensionality system. The findings suggest acetaldehyde's increased propensity for roaming compared to formaldehyde may arise from the presence of multiple distinct roaming mechanisms rather than solely the higher roaming fragment mass.</description>

      <title>Koopmon trajectories in nonadiabatic quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to alleviate the computational costs of fully quantum nonadiabatic dynamics, we present a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) particle method based on the theory of Koopman wavefunctions. Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</description>

      <title>A classical density functional theory for solvation across length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim of multiscale modeling is to use results from the Schr\"odinger Equation to predict phenomenology on length scales that far exceed those of typical molecular correlations. In this work, we present a new approach rooted in classical density functional theory (cDFT) that allows us to accurately describe the solvation of apolar solutes across length scales. Our approach builds on the Lum, Chandler and Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity [J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570 (1999)] by constructing a free energy functional that uses a slowly-varying component of the density field as a reference. From a practical viewpoint, the theory we present is numerically simpler and generalizes to solutes with soft-core repulsion more easily than LCW theory. Furthermore, by assessing the local compressibility and its critical scaling behavior, we demonstrate that our LCW-style cDFT approach contains the physics of critical drying, which has been emphasized as an essential aspect of hydrophobicity by recent theories. As our approach is parameterized on the two-body direct correlation function of the uniform fluid and the liquid-vapor surface tension, it straightforwardly captures the temperature dependence of solvation. Moreover, we use our theory to describe solvation at a first-principles level, on length scales that vastly exceed what is accessible to molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Photochemically-induced acousto-optics in gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optics consists of launching acoustic waves in a medium (usually a crystal) in order to modulate its refractive index and create a tunable optical grating. In this article, we present the theoretical basis of a new scheme to generate acousto-optics in a gas, where the acoustic waves are initiated by the localized absorption (and thus gas heating) of spatially-modulated UV light, as was demonstrated in Y. Michine and H. Yoneda, Commun. Phys. 3, 24 (2020). We identify the chemical reactions initiated by the absorption of UV light via the photodissociation of ozone molecules present in the gas, and calculate the resulting temperature increase in the gas as a function of space and time. Solving the Euler fluid equations shows that the modulated, isochoric heating initiates a mixed acoustic/entropy wave in the gas, whose high-amplitude density (and thus refractive index) modulation can be used to manipulate a high-power laser. We calculate that diffraction efficiencies near 100% can be obtained using only a few millimeters of gas containing a few percent ozone fraction at room temperature, with UV fluences of less than 100 mJ/cm2, consistent with the experimental measurements. Our analysis suggests possible ways to optimize the diffraction efficiency by changing the buffer gas composition. Gases have optics damage thresholds two to three orders of magnitude beyond those of solids; these optical elements should therefore be able to manipulate kJ-class lasers.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>
