      <title>Generalizations of the Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform for Limited Data Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT) exploits one-dimensional Wasserstein transport and the Radon transform to represent prominent features in images. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications. Second, we study multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings by making use of generalized Radon transforms. We prove that our novel feature representations are invariant under certain transformations and allow for linear separation in feature space. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments based on 2d images, 3d shapes and 3d rotation matrices, showing near perfect classification accuracies and clustering results.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a novel Lagrange multiplier formulation for fluid-poroelastic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel monolithic formulation that employs Lagrange multipliers (LMs) to couple a fluid flow governed by the time-dependent Stokes equations with a poroelastic structure described by the Biot equations. The formulation is developed in detail, and we establish the well-posedness of both the semi-discrete and fully discrete saddle point problems. We further prove the stability of the fully discrete system. This saddle point formulation, which utilizes three LMs, is designed to enable a partitioned approach that completely decouples the Stokes and Biot subdomains, and this approach will be explored in a subsequent work.</description>

      <title>The Instability of Painlev\'e Equations in Recovering Largest Eigenvalue Distributions of GUE, LUE, JUE and an Attempt of Solution to It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the largest eigenvalue for the three classical unitary ensembles -- GUE, LUE, and JUE -- admits two complementary exact descriptions: (i) as Fredholm determinants of their orthogonal--polynomial correlation kernels and (ii) as isomonodromic $\tau$--functions governed by Painlev\'e equations. For finite $n$, the associated Jimbo--Miwa--Okamoto $\sigma$--forms are $\PIV$ (GUE), $\mathrm{PV}$ (LUE), and $\PVI$ (JUE); under soft- or hard-edge scalings these degenerate to $\PII$ or $\PIIIp$ descriptions of the Tracy--Widom and hard-edge laws \cite{tracy1994level,forrester2003painleve,deift1999orthogonal}.
  It is well known among random matrix theorists (for example Folkmar Bornemann) that the Fredholm determinant is a more numerically stable and accurate way to compute the CDF of the largest eigenvalue for GUE, LUE, JUE than direct Painlev\'e integration. The aim of this paper is not to improve on Fredholm methods, but to see to what extent one can numerically recover the \emph{correct} Painlev\'e solution from finite-$n$ data and how unstable this reconstruction is. Numerically, we verify the equality between the Fredholm- and Painlev\'e-based CDFs by combining (a) high-accuracy Nystr\"om discretizations of the finite-$n$ Fredholm determinants \cite{bornemann2010numerical} with (b) an anchored, branch-locked integration of the $\sigma$--form ODEs, where anchors are extracted from local least-squares fits to $\log\det(I-\mathsf K)$. Our results confirm agreement across GUE/LUE/JUE with precision of $O(10^{-3})$ to $O(10^{-5})$ (occasionally $O(10^{-2})$) and illustrate the finite-$n$ to scaling-limit transition. The theoretical connections to $\tau$--functions and Virasoro constraints follow the framework of \cite{adler2000random,forrester2003painleve}</description>

      <title>Duct boundary conditions for incompressible fluid flows: finite element discretizations and parameter estimation in coronary blood flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D-0D coupled flow models are widely used across many application fields but remain challenging to solve. Implicit coupling introduces non-local terms, whereas explicit coupling results in only conditionally stable schemes. Furthermore, incorporating inertial effects alongside viscous resistance enlarges the parameter space, making calibration more difficult.
  In this work, we propose a new type of boundary condition based on the method of asymptotic partial decomposition of a domain (MAPDD), which we denote as the Duct Boundary Condition (DuBC). This approach enables the incorporation of geometrically reduced domains as a boundary term with only local coupling in the implicit case. Moreover, the DuBC accounts for both viscous and inertial effects simultaneously using a single physical parameter. Additionally, we derive a fractional-step time-marching scheme including the DuBC. We demonstrate the features of the DuBC in coronary artery blood flow simulations, including sequential parameter estimation from noisy velocity data.</description>

      <title>A reconstructed discontinuous approximation for distributed elliptic control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and analyze an internal penalty discontinuous Galerkin method for the distributed elliptic optimal control problems. It is based on a reconstructed discontinuous approximation which admits arbitrarily high-order approximation space with only one unknown per element. Applying this method, we develop a proper discretization scheme that approximates the state and adjoint variables in the approximation space. Our main contributions are twofold: (1) the derivation of both a priori and a posteriori error estimates of the $L^2$-norm and the energy norms, and (2) the implementation of an efficiently solvable discrete system, which is solved via a linearly convergent projected gradient descent method. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the convergence order in a priori estimate and the efficiency of a posteriori error estimate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Discrepancy of Random Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L_p$-discrepancy of random point sets in high dimensions, with emphasis on small values of $p$. Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights.
  Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \in [1,\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$.
  Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets.</description>

      <title>Construction and Performance of Kinetic Schemes for Linear Systems of Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a methodology to build vectorial kinetic schemes, targetting the numerical solution of linear symmetric-hyperbolic systems of conservation laws -a minimal application case for those schemes. Precisely, we fully detail the construction of kinetic schemes that satisfy a discrete equivalent to a convex extension (an additional non-trivial conservation law) of the target system -the (linear) acoustic and elastodynamics systems, specifically -. Then, we evaluate numerically the convergence of various possible kinetic schemes toward smooth solutions, in comparison with standard finite-difference and finite-volume discretizations on Cartesian meshes. Our numerical results confirm the interest of ensuring a discrete equivalent to a convex extension, and show the influence of remaining parameter variations in terms of error magnitude, both for ''first-order'' and ''second-order'' kinetic schemes\,: the parameter choice with largest CFL number (equiv., smallest spurious diffusion in the equivalent equation analysis) has the smallest discretization error.</description>

      <title>A scalable high-order multigrid-FFT Poisson solver for unbounded domains on adaptive multiresolution grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are among the most efficient methods for solving the Poisson equation, which is ubiquitous in computational physics. For example, in the context of incompressible flows, it is typically the costliest operation. The present document expounds upon the implementation of a flexible multigrid solver that is capable of handling any type of boundary conditions within murphy, a multiresolution framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on collocated adaptive grids. The utilization of a Fourier-based direct solver facilitates the attainment of flexibility and enhanced performance by accommodating any combination of unbounded and semi-unbounded boundary conditions. The employment of high-order compact stencils contributes to the reduction of communication demands while concurrently enhancing the accuracy of the system. The resulting solver is validated against analytical solutions for periodic and unbounded domains. In conclusion, the solver has been demonstrated to demonstrate scalability to 16,384 cores within the context of leading European high-performance computing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>A fourth-order multi-scale computational method and its convergence analysis for composite Kirchhoff plates with microscopic periodic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirchhoff plate model plays a vital role in modeling, computing and analyzing the mechanical behaviors of thin plate structures. This study propose a novel fourth-order multi-scale (FOMS) computational method for high-accuracy and efficient simulation of composite Kirchhoff plates with highly periodic heterogeneities. At first, two-scale asymptotic expansion theory is employed to establish the high-accuracy fourth-order multi-scale computation model with novel fourth-order correctors for composite Kirchhoff plates, which are governed by fourth-order partial differential equation (PDE) with periodically oscillatory and highly discontinuous coefficients. Then, the locally point-wise error analysis is derived to theoretically illustrate the local balance preserving of fourth-order multi-scale model enabling high-accuracy multi-scale computation. Furthermore, a global error estimation with an explicit order for fourth-order multi-scale solutions is first demonstrated under appropriate assumptions. In contrast to the second- and third-order multi-scale solutions, only the fourth-order one is capable of providing an explicit error order estimate. Additionally, an efficient numerical algorithm is developed to conduct high-accuracy simulation for heterogeneous plate structures. Extensive numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical results for the computational convergence and accuracy of the proposed method. This work offers a higher-order (fourth-order) multi-scale computational framework that enables robust simulation and high-accuracy analysis to composite Kirchhoff plates.</description>

      <title>Compact Runge-Kutta flux reconstruction methods for non-conservative hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact Runge-Kutta (cRK) Flux Reconstruction (FR) methods are a variant of RKFR methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with a compact stencil including only immediate neighboring finite elements. We extend cRKFR methods to handle hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. To handle stiff source terms, we use IMplicit EXplicit (IMEX) time integration schemes such that the implicitness is local to each solution point, and thus does not increase inter-element communication. Although non-conservative products do not correspond to a physical flux, we formulate the scheme using numerical fluxes at element interfaces. We use similar numerical fluxes for a lower order finite volume scheme on subcells of each element, which is then blended with the high order cRKFR scheme to obtain a robust scheme for problems with non-smooth solutions. Combined with a flux limiter at the element interfaces, the subcell based blending scheme preserves the physical admissibility of the solution, e.g., positivity of density and pressure for compressible Euler equations. The procedure thus leads to an admissibility preserving IMEX cRKFR scheme for hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. The capability of the scheme to handle stiff terms is shown through numerical tests involving Burgers' equations, reactive Euler's equations, and the ten moment problem. The non-conservative treatment is tested using variable advection equations, shear shallow water equations, the GLM-MHD, and the multi-ion MHD equations.</description>

      <title>A Task Parallel Orthonormalization Multigrid Method For Multiphase Elliptic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigrid methods have been a popular approach for solving linear systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) for several decades. They are particularly effective for accelerating convergence rates with optimal complexity in terms of both time and space. K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid is a robust variant of the multigrid method that combines the efficiency of multigrid with the robustness of Krylov-type residual minimalizations for problems with strong anisotropies. However, traditional implementations of K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid often rely on bulk-synchronous parallelism, which can limit scalability on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This paper presents a task- parallel variant of the K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid method that leverages asynchronous execution to improve scalability and performance on large-scale parallel systems.</description>

      <title>Explainable Learning Based Regularization of Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques for the solution of inverse problems have become an attractive approach in the last decade, while their theoretical foundations are still in their infancy. In this chapter we want to pursue the study of regularization properties, robustness, convergence rates, and structure of regularizers for inverse problems obtained from different learning paradigms. For this sake we study simple architectures that are explainable in the sense that they allow for a theoretical analysis also in the infinite-dimensional limit. In particular we will advance the study of spectral architectures with new results on convergence rates highlighting the role of the smoothness in the training data set, and a study of adversarial robustness. We can show that adversarial training is actually a convergent regularization method. Moreover, we discuss extensions to frame systems and CNN-type architectures for variational regularizers, where we obtain some results on their structure by carefully designed numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Space-time discretization for barotropic flow stemming from a multisymplectic variational formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes and analyses a novel higher-order, structure preserving discretization method for inviscid barotropic flows from a Lagrangian perspective. The method is built on a multisymplectic variational principle discretized over a full space-time domain. Flow variables are encoded on a staggered space-time mesh, leveraging the principles of mimetic spectral element discretization. Unlike standard Lagrangian methods, which are prone to mesh distortion, this framework computes fluid deformations in a fixed reference configuration and systematically maps them to the physical domain via the Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Further, the structure preserving design ensures that the discrete analogues of the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are satisfied up to machine precision. The formulation also inherently handles low-Mach number flows without specialized preconditioning. Numerical experiments on expansion and compression flows confirm the accuracy, stability, and exact conservation properties of the discretization.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Forecasts of Public Sentiments via Convexification for Mean Field Games: Evidence from Real World COVID-19 Discussion Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a convexification-based numerical method to forecast public sentiment dynamics using Mean Field Games (MFGs). The theoretical foundation for the convexification approach, established in our prior work, guarantees global convergence to the unique solution to the MFG system. The present work demonstrates the practical potential of this framework using real-world sentiment data extracted from social media public discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the MFG model with appropriate parameters and convexification yields sentiment density predictions that align closely with observed data and satisfy the governing equations. While current parameter selection relies on manual calibration, our findings establish the first proof-of-concept evidence that MFG models can capture complex temporal patterns in public sentiment, laying the groundwork for future work on systematic parameter identification methods, i.e. solutions of coefficient inverse problems for the MFG system.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the passage of limits from discrete to continuous condensing aggregation equation which comprises of Oort-Hulst-Safronov (OHS) equation together with inverse aggregation process. We establish the relation between discrete and continuous condensing aggregation equations in its most generalized form, where kinetic-kernels with respect to OHS and inverse aggregation equations are not always equal. Convergence criterion is proved under suitable a priori estimates by approximating the continuous equation through a sequence of discrete equations, which subsequently converges towards the solution of the continuous equation by weak compactness principles. Existence of solution to the discrete model and uniform bounds on different order moments over finite time under particular conditions on kinetic-kernels are investigated. We analyze long-time dynamics and blowup of the solution leading to mass-loss or gelation for specific kernels. Three numerical experiments show the accuracy and convergence of approximated solutions to the exact solution of the continuous equation when $\varepsilon$ approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Provable Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Bayesian Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel diffusion-based posterior sampling method within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework. Our approach constructs a probability transport from an easy-to-sample terminal distribution to the target posterior, using a warm-start strategy to initialize the particles. To approximate the posterior score, we develop a Monte Carlo estimator in which particles are generated using Langevin dynamics, avoiding the heuristic approximations commonly used in prior work. The score governing the Langevin dynamics is learned from data, enabling the model to capture rich structural features of the underlying prior distribution. On the theoretical side, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds, showing that the method converges even for complex, multi-modal target posterior distributions. These bounds explicitly quantify the errors arising from posterior score estimation, the warm-start initialization, and the posterior sampling procedure. Our analysis further clarifies how the prior score-matching error and the condition number of the Bayesian inverse problem influence overall performance. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across a range of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Learned iterative networks: An operator learning perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned image reconstruction has become a pillar in computational imaging and inverse problems. Among the most successful approaches are learned iterative networks, which are formulated by unrolling classical iterative optimisation algorithms for solving variational problems. While the underlying algorithm is usually formulated in the functional analytic setting, learned approaches are often viewed as purely discrete. In this chapter we present a unified operator view for learned iterative networks. Specifically, we formulate a learned reconstruction operator, defining how to compute, and separately the learning problem, which defines what to compute. In this setting we present common approaches and show that many approaches are closely related in their core. We review linear as well as nonlinear inverse problems in this framework and present a short numerical study to conclude.</description>

      <title>A Novel Wasserstein Quaternion Generative Adversarial Network for Color Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color image generation has a wide range of applications, but the existing generation models ignore the correlation among color channels, which may lead to chromatic aberration problems. In addition, the data distribution problem of color images has not been systematically elaborated and explained, so that there is still the lack of the theory about measuring different color images datasets. In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality.</description>

      <title>Calibration of a DEM contact model for wet industrial granular materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents and calibrates a Discrete Element Method (DEM) contact model for wet granular materials in the pendular regime. The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic angle of repose as a calibration target and highlight the limitations of particle scaling for strongly cohesive wet granular systems. The proposed framework provides a practical basis for DEM-based modeling of wet powder flow in industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Applications of Singular Entropy to Signals and Singular Smoothness to Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores signal and image analysis by using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its extension, the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD). A key strength of SVD lies in its ability to separate information into orthogonal subspaces. While SVD is a well-established tool in ECG analysis, particularly for source separation, this work proposes a refined method for selecting a threshold to distinguish between maternal and fetal components more effectively. In the first part of the paper, the focus is onmedical signal analysis,where the concepts of Energy Gap Variation (EGV) and Singular Energy are introduced to isolate fetal and maternal ECG signals, improving the known ones. Furthermore, the approach is significantly enhanced by the application of GSVD, which provides additional discriminative power for more accurate signal separation. The second part introduces a novel technique called Singular Smoothness, developed for image analysis. This method incorporates Singular Entropy and the Frobenius normto evaluate information density, and is applied to the detection of natural anomalies such asmountain fractures and burned forest regions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>The Cahill-Casazza-Daubechies problem on H\"older stable phase retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval using a frame for a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is known to always be Lipschitz stable. However, phase retrieval using a frame or a continuous frame for an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is always unstable. In order to bridge the gap between the finite and infinite dimensional phenomena, Cahill-Casazza-Daubechies (Trans.Amer.Math.Soc. 2016) gave a construction of a family of nonlinear subsets of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space where phase retrieval could be performed with a H\"older stability estimate. They then posed the question of whether these subsets satisfied Lipschitz stable phase retrieval. We solve this problem both by giving examples which fail Lipschitz stability and by giving examples which satisfy Lipschitz stability.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14201v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we instead use rough path theory to establish pathwise convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require adaptive step sizes to have a "no skip" property and to take values at only dyadic times. Secondly, in contrast to the Euler-Maruyama method, we require the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive and analyze numerical methods for underdamped (kinetic) Langevin dynamics in a domain with elastic reflection at the boundary. First-order approximations are based on an Euler-type scheme incorporating collision-handling at the boundary. To achieve second order, composition schemes are derived based on decomposition of the generator into collisional drift, impulse, and stochastic momentum evolution. In a deterministic setting, this approach would typically lead to first-order approximation, even in symmetric compositions, but we find that the stochastic method can provide second-order weak approximation with a single gradient evaluation, both at finite times and in the ergodic limit. We provide analysis of this observation, as well as numerical demonstration, and we compare and contrast the performance of different variants of the integration method using model problems.</description>

      <title>Rational complex Bezier curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the formalism of rational complex Bezier curves. This framework is a simple extension of the CAD paradigm, since it describes arc of curves in terms of control polygons and weights, which are extended to complex values. One of the major advantages of this extension is that we may make use of two different groups of projective transformations. Besides the group of projective transformations of the real plane, we have the group of complex projective transformations. This allows us to apply useful transformations like the geometric inversion to curves in design. In addition to this, the use of the complex formulation allows to lower the degree of the curves in some cases. This can be checked using the resultant of two polynomials and provides a simple formula for determining whether a rational cubic curve is a conic or not. Examples of application of the formalism to classical curves are included.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximations to invariant measures of hybrid stochastic differential equations with superlinear coefficients via the backward Euler-Maruyama method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with Markovian switching, whose drift and diffusion coefficients are allowed to contain superlinear terms, the backward Euler-Maruyama (BEM) method is proposed to approximate the invariant measure. The existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure of the numerical solution generated by the BEM method is proved. Then the convergence of the numerical invariant measure to its underlying counterpart is shown. Those results obtained in this work release the requirement of the global Lipschitz condition on the diffusion coefficient in [X. Li et al. SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 56(3)(2018), pp. 1435-1455] and can also be regarded as a non-trivial extension of [W. Liu et al. Appl. Numer. Math. 184(2023), pp. 137-150] to the case of hybrid SDEs.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the Schr\"odinger bridge problems by a family of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems with no terminal time distribution constraint. In doing so, we use the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures and then describe the constraint as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the control problems. A sequence of the probability laws of the state processes resulting from $\epsilon$-optimal controls converges to a unique solution of the Schr\"odinger's problem under mild conditions on given initial and terminal time distributions and an underlying diffusion process. We propose a neural SDE based deep learning algorithm for the Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems. Several numerical experiments validate our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering frequency-localized functions from pointwise data is a fundamental task in signal processing. We examine this problem from an approximation-theoretic perspective, focusing on least squares and deep learning-based methods. First, we establish a novel recovery theorem for least squares approximations using the Slepian basis from uniform random samples in low dimensions, explicitly tracking the dependence of the bandwidth on the sampling complexity. Building on these results, we then present a recovery guarantee for approximating bandlimited functions via deep learning from pointwise data. This result, framed as a practical existence theorem, provides conditions on the network architecture, training procedure, and data acquisition sufficient for accurate approximation. To complement our theoretical findings, we perform numerical comparisons between least squares and deep learning for approximating one- and two-dimensional functions. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical limitations and the practical gaps between theory and implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BGG resolutions and generalized BGG resolutions from representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras have been generalized to sequences of invariant differential operators on manifolds endowed with a geometric structure belonging to the family of parabolic geometries. Two of these structures, conformal structures and projective structures, occur as weakenings of a Riemannian metric respectively of a specified torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle. In particular, one obtains BGG sequences on open subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ as very special cases of the construction. It turned out that several examples of the latter sequences are of interest in applied mathematics, since they can be used to construct numerical methods to study operators relevant for elasticity theory, numerical relativity and related fields.
  This article is intended to provide an intermediate level between BGG sequences for parabolic geometries and the case of domains in $\mathbb R^n$. We provide a construction of conformal BGG sequences on Riemannian manifolds and of projective BGG sequences on manifolds endowed with a volume preserving linear connection on their tangent bundle. These constructions do not need any input from parabolic geometries. Except from standard differential geometry methods the only deeper input comes from representation theory. So one can either view the results as a simplified version of the constructions for parabolic geometries in an explicit form. Alternatively, one can view them as providing an extension of the simplified constructions for domains in $\Bbb R^n$ to general Riemannian manifolds or to manifolds endowed with an appropriate connection on the tangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has emerged as a robust alternative to Krylov eigensolvers for extracting a small subset of extremal eigenpairs from large sparse matrices, particularly in situations where these eigenpairs must be computed repeatedly as the system matrix evolves within an outer iteration. In this work, we propose R-ChFSI, a residual based reformulation of ChFSI designed to exhibit strong convergence properties even when the matrix-vector products are computed inexactly. We derive convergence guarantees under matrix-vector product approximations, providing a rigorous foundation for the method in large-scale eigenvalue computations. The tolerance of R-ChFSI to inexact matrix-vector products enables an efficient treatment of generalized Hermitian definite eigenproblems of the form $\textbf{A} \textbf{x} = \lambda \textbf{B} \textbf{x}$ where exact factorizations or high-accuracy iterative solves for evaluating $\textbf{B}^{-1}$ are often prohibitively expensive. Moreover, R-ChFSI naturally accommodates low-precision arithmetic for both standard and generalized eigenproblems, making it well-suited for modern hardware accelerators optimised for mixed-precision computation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, extensive numerical experiments are conducted on finite-element discretized eigenproblems with millions of degrees of freedom, solving for thousands of eigenpairs arising in \emph{ab initio} material modelling using Kohn-Sham density functional theory. For generalized eigenproblems employing approximate $\textbf{B}^{-1}$, R-ChFSI achieves desired residual norms orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained with standard ChFSI. In addition, R-ChFSI reliably reaches target residual tolerances (e.g., 10$^{-8}$) even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings.</description>

      <title>Computing the Tropical Abel--Jacobi Transform and Tropical Distances for Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11619</link>

Abstract: Metric graphs are important models for capturing the structure of complex data across various domains. While much effort has been devoted to extracting geometric and topological features from graph data, computational aspects of metric graphs as abstract tropical curves remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first computational and machine learning-driven study of metric graphs from the perspective of tropical algebraic geometry. Specifically, we study the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform, a vectorization of points on a metric graph via the tropical Abel--Jacobi map into its associated flat torus, the tropical Jacobian. We develop algorithms to compute this transform and investigate how the resulting embeddings depend on different combinatorial models of the same metric graph.
  Once embedded, we compute pairwise distances between points in the tropical Jacobian under two natural metrics: the tropical polarization distance and the Foster--Zhang distance. Computing these distances are generally NP-hard as they turn out to be linked to classical lattice problems in computational complexity, however, we identify a class of metric graphs where fast and explicit computations are feasible. For the general case, we propose practical algorithms for both exact and approximate distance matrix computations using lattice basis reduction and mixed-integer programming solvers. Our work lays the groundwork for future applications of tropical geometry and the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform in machine learning and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Minimal dispersion on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal spherical cap dispersion ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ is the largest number $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ such that, for every $n$ points on the $d$-dimensional Euclidean unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, there exists a spherical cap with normalized area $\varepsilon$ not containing any of these points. We study the behavior of ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ as $n$ and $d$ grow to infinity. We develop connections to the problems of sphere covering and approximation of the Euclidean unit ball by inscribed polytopes. Existing and new results are presented in a unified way. Upper bounds on ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ result from choosing the points independently and uniformly at random and possibly adding some well-separated points to close large gaps. Moreover, we study dispersion with respect to intersections of caps.</description>

      <title>Contractive kinetic Langevin samplers beyond global Lipschitz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the problem of sampling from log-concave distributions with (possibly) superlinear gradient growth under kinetic (underdamped) Langevin algorithms. Using a carefully tailored taming scheme, we propose two novel discretizations of the kinetic Langevin SDE, and we show that they are both contractive and satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Building on this, we establish a series of non-asymptotic bounds in $2$-Wasserstein distance between the law reached by each algorithm and the underlying target measure.</description>
