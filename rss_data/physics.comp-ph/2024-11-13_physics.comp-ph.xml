      <title>Hybrid finite element implementation of a two-potential constitutive modeling of dielectric elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric elastomers are increasingly studied for their potential in soft robotics, actuators, and haptic devices. Under time-dependent loading, they dissipate energy via viscous deformation and friction in electric polarization. However, most constitutive models and finite element (FE) implementations consider only mechanical dissipation because mechanical relaxation times are much larger than electric ones. Accounting for electric dissipation is crucial when dealing with alternating electric fields. Ghosh et al. (2021) proposed a fully coupled three-dimensional constitutive model for isotropic, incompressible dielectric elastomers. We critically investigate their numerical scheme for solving the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) describing the time-dependent behavior. We find that their fifth-order explicit Runge-Kutta time discretization may require excessively small or unphysical time steps for realistic simulations due to the stark contrast in mechanical and electric relaxation times. To address this, we present a stable implicit time-integration algorithm that overcomes these constraints. We implement this algorithm with a conforming FE discretization to solve the IBVP and present the mixed-FE formulation implemented in FEniCSx. We demonstrate that the scheme is robust, accurate, and capable of handling finite deformations, incompressibility, and general time-dependent loading. Finally, we validate our code against experimental data for VHB 4910 under complex time-dependent electromechanical loading, as studied by Hossain et al. (2015).</description>

      <title>Impact of Numerical Fluxes on High Order Semidiscrete WENO-DeC Finite Volume Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical flux determines the performance of numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we compare a selection of 8 numerical fluxes in the framework of nonlinear semidiscrete finite volume (FV) schemes, based on Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The methodology is implemented and systematically assessed for order of accuracy in space and time up to seven. The numerical fluxes selected in the present study represent the two existing classes of fluxes, namely centred and upwind. Centred fluxes do not explicitly use wave propagation information, while, upwind fluxes do so from the solution of the Riemann problem via a wave model containing $A$ waves. Upwind fluxes include two subclasses: complete and incomplete fluxes. For complete upwind fluxes, $A=E$, where $E$ is the number of characteristic fields in the exact problem. For incomplete upwind ones, $A&lt;E$. Our study is conducted for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations, for which we consider the following numerical fluxes: Lax-Friedrichs (LxF), First-Order Centred (FORCE), Rusanov (Rus), Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL), Central-Upwind (CU), Low-Dissipation Central-Upwind (LDCU), HLLC, and the flux computed through the exact Riemann solver (Ex.RS). We find that the numerical flux has an effect on the performance of the methods. The magnitude of the effect depends on the type of numerical flux and on the order of accuracy of the scheme. It also depends on the type of problem; that is, whether the solution is smooth or discontinuous, whether discontinuities are linear or nonlinear, whether linear discontinuities are fast- or slowly-moving, and whether the solution is evolved for short or long time.</description>

      <title>KH-PINN: Physics-informed neural networks for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability with spatiotemporal and magnitude multiscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is crucial across various fields, requiring extensive high-fidelity data. However, experimental data are often sparse and noisy, while simulated data may lack credibility due to discrepancies with real-world configurations and parameters. This underscores the need for field reconstruction and parameter inference from sparse, noisy data, which constitutes inverse problems. Based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the KH-PINN framework is established in this work to solve the inverse problems of KHI flows. By incorporating the governing physical equations, KH-PINN reconstructs continuous flow fields and infer unknown transport parameters from sparse, noisy observed data. The 2D unsteady incompressible flows with both constant and variable densities are studied. To our knowledge, this is the first application of PINNs to unsteady incompressible flows with variable densities. To address the spatiotemporal multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-scale structures, the multiscale embedding (ME) strategy is adopted. To address the magnitude multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-magnitude velocities, which are critical for KHI problems, the small-velocity amplification (SVA) strategy is proposed. The results demonstrate that KH-PINN can accurately reconstruct the fields with complex, evolving vortices and infer unknown parameters across a broad range of Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the energy-decaying and entropy-increasing curves are accurately obtained. The effectiveness of ME and SVA is validated through comparative studies, and the anti-noise and few-shot learning capabilities of KH-PINN are also validated. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/CAME-THU/KH-PINN.</description>

      <title>Parallel Multi-Coordinate Descent Methods for Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a multi-threaded parallel coordinate descent full configuration interaction algorithm (mCDFCI), for the electronic structure ground-state calculation in the configuration interaction framework. The FCI problem is reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem, and tackled by a modified block coordinate descent method with a deterministic compression strategy. mCDFCI is designed to prioritize determinants based on their importance, with block updates enabling efficient parallelization on shared-memory, multi-core computing infrastructure. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm by computing an accurate benchmark energy for the chromium dimer in the Ahlrichs SV basis (48e, 42o), which explicitly includes $2.07 \times 10^9$ variational determinants. We also provide the binding curve of the nitrogen dimer under the cc-pVQZ basis set (14e, 110o). Benchmarks show up to $79.3\%$ parallel efficiency on 128 cores.</description>

      <title>Real-time propagation of adaptive sampling selected configuration interaction wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new time propagation method, time-dependent adaptive sampling configuration interaction (TD-ASCI), to describe the dynamics of a strongly correlated system. We employ the short iterative Lanczos (SIL) method as the time-integrator, which provides a unitary, norm-conserving, and stable long-time propagation scheme. We used the TD-ASCI method to evaluate the time-domain correlation functions of molecular systems. The accuracy of the correlation function was assessed by Fourier transforming (FT) into the frequency domain to compute the dipole-allowed absorption spectra. The FT has been carried out with a short-time signal of the correlation function to reduce the computation time, using an efficient alternative FT scheme based on the ESPRIT signal processing algorithm. We have applied the {TD-ASCI} method to prototypical strongly correlated molecular systems and compared the absorption spectra to spectra evaluated using the equation of motion coupled cluster (EOMCC) method with a truncation at single-doubles-triples (SDT) level.</description>

      <title>Generating and analyzing small-size datasets to explore physical observables in quantum Ising systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a detailed analysis of datasets generated from simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin systems using the quantum Ising model at absolute zero temperature. Our focus is on examining how fundamental physical properties, energy, magnetization, and entanglement entropy, evolve under varying external transverse magnetic fields and system sizes. From the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), we simulate systems with 4, 8, and 16 spins arranged in square lattices, generating extensive datasets with 5000 samples per magnetic field value. The Hamiltonian operator incorporates quantum mechanical effects such as superposition and tunneling, challenging classical interpretations of spin states. We compute extended Pauli operators and construct the Hamiltonian to include spin-spin interactions and transverse field terms. Our analysis reveals that as the system size increases, fluctuations in energy and entanglement entropy become more evident, indicating lifted sensitivity to external perturbations and suggesting the onset of quantum phase transitions. Spin-spin correlation functions demonstrate that interactions are predominantly local, but larger systems exhibit more complex and fluctuating correlations. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of quantum spin systems and lay the groundwork for future machine learning applications aimed at predicting physical quantities and identifying phase transitions from a quantum perspective.</description>

      <title>A low-dissipation numerical method based on boundary variation diminishing principle for compressible gas-liquid two-phase flows with phase change on unstructured grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A low-dissipation numerical method for compressible gas-liquid two-phase flow with phase change on unstructured grids is proposed. The governing equations adopt the six-equation model. The non-conservative terms included in the volume fraction and total energy equations of the six-equation model are defined on cell boundaries using second-order accurate approximations and calculated without interpolating the spatial derivatives. To capture discontinuities such as contact discontinuities and gas-liquid interfaces with low dissipation, the MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD scheme, which combines the Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) method and the Tangent Hyperbola for INterface Capturing method with Quadratic surface representation and Gaussian Quadrature (THINC/QQ) method, is employed. The MUSCL method is one of the mainstream numerical solvers for compressible flows, achieving second-order accuracy for smooth solutions, but it introduces excessive numerical dissipation errors near discontinuous solutions. The THINC/QQ method uses a reconstruction function developed for interface capturing on unstructured grids, making use of a sigmoidal function with a quadratic surface. By combining these reconstruction functions according to the Boundary Variation Diminishing (BVD) principle, the MUSCL method is selected for smooth solutions, while the THINC/QQ method is chosen for discontinuous solutions, preserving the solution structure accurately. Several benchmark tests are solved, demonstrating that the MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD scheme not only captures contact discontinuities with low dissipation but also resolves dynamically generated gas-liquid interfaces due to phase changes clearly.</description>

      <title>API Phonons: Python Interfaces for Phonon Transport Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: API Phonons is a Python software package to predict the transport dynamics of heat-carrying phonons. Using the powerful syntax of Python, this package provides modules and functions interfacing between different packages for atomistic simulations, lattice dynamics, and phonon-phonon interaction calculations including LAMMPS, Quippy, Phonopy, and ShengBTE. API Phonons enabled complex phonon calculations, including (1) extracting harmonic and anharmonic force constants from arbitrary interatomic potentials, which can be used as inputs for solving Boltzmann transport equations; (2) predicting thermal conductivity using Kubo's linear response theory, which captures both quasiparticle transport and inter-band coherent transport; and (3) modeling of ultrafast pump-probe thermal responses using a Green's function approach based on mode-resolved phonon properties for studying ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport dynamics. The package provides a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensive platform for modeling phonon transport physics through Python programming.</description>

      <title>MDRefine: a Python package for refining Molecular Dynamics trajectories with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in resolving the underlying conformational dynamics of molecular systems. However, their capability to correctly reproduce and predict dynamics in agreement with experiments is limited by the accuracy of the force-field model. This capability can be improved by refining the structural ensembles or the force-field parameters. Furthermore, discrepancies with experimental data can be due to imprecise forward models, namely, functions mapping simulated structures to experimental observables. Here, we introduce MDRefine, a Python package aimed at implementing the refinement of the ensemble, the force-field and/or the forward model by comparing MD-generated trajectories with experimental data. The software consists of several tools that can be employed separately from each other or combined together in different ways, providing a seamless interpolation between these three different types of refinement. We use some benchmark cases to show that the combined approach is superior to separately applied refinements. Source code, documentation and examples are freely available at https://pypi.org/project/MDRefine and https://github.com/bussilab/MDRefine.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Phase-Field Modeling of Rapid Alloy Solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [Ji et al., PRL 2023]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity framework can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. Furthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difference and similarity between the velocity- and position-Verlet integrators are discussed from the viewpoint of their Hamiltonian representations for both linear and nonlinear systems. For a harmonic oscillator, the exact Hamiltonians reveal that positional trajectories generated by the two integrators follow an identical second-order differential equation and thus can be matched by adjusting initial conditions. In contrast, the series expansion of the Hamiltonians for the nonlinear discrete dynamics clearly indicate that the two integrators differ fundamentally. These analytical results are confirmed by simple numerical simulations of harmonic and anharmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Propensity of water self-ions at air(oil)-water interfaces revealed by deep potential molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) towards air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations based on state-of-the-art neural network potentials with approximate M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and hydroxide ions at air/oil(decane)-water interfaces, which can simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these ions, recombination of ions, and ionic distribution along the normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi collective variables. A stable ionic double-layer distribution is observed near the air-water interface, while the distribution is different at oil-water interfaces, where hydronium tends to be repelled from the interface into the bulk water, whereas hydroxide, with an interfacial stabilization free energy of -0.6 kcal/mol, is enriched in the interfacial layer. Through simulations of oil droplets in water, we further reveal that the interfacial propensity of hydroxide ions is caused by the positive charge distribution of the oil-water interface contributed by hydrogens of the dangling OH bonds of interfacial water layer and the outmost layer decane molecules laying flat on the droplet. The present results may aid in understanding the acid-base nature of water interfaces with wide applications.</description>

      <title>On the fractal dimension of non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flow subject to Saffman-Taylor instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete numerical method based on the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) approach to simulate two-fluid Hele-Shaw flow subject to the Saffman-Taylor interfacial instability, in the case where the displaced fluid is non-Newtonian. Focusing on fluids for which the most relevant non-Newtonian aspect of the thin-gap flow is shear-thinning, we introduce a history-dependent aspect into the algorithm, modeling shear-rate-dependent fluid viscosity. The main finding is that the morphology of the emerging patterns, characterized by the fractal dimension, is modified in a nontrivial manner by the shear-thinning nature of the displaced fluid. In particular, we consistently find that shear-thinning leads to the formation of patterns characterized by a smaller fractal dimension, compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid.</description>

Abstract: The Rosanna shuffle, the drum pattern from Toto's 1982 hit "Rosanna", is one of the most recognized drum beats in popular music. Recorded by Jeff Porcaro, this drum beat features a half-time shuffle with rapid triplets on the hi-hat and snare drum. In this analysis, we examine the timing and dynamics of the original drum track, focusing on rhythmic variations such as swing factor, microtiming deviations, tempo drift, and the overall dynamics of the hi-hat pattern. Our findings reveal that "Rosanna" exhibits a surprisingly pronounced swing for its genre, along with notable tempo drift typical of tracks recorded without a metronome. Additionally, we observe clear long-range correlations in the microtiming deviations, consistent with previous studies. Notably, the two-bar phrases of the song feature a distinctive repeating pattern in the timing and dynamics of the hi-hat beats, which enhances the song's phrasing. Overall, the Rosanna shuffle boasts a rich array of rhythmic characteristics that solidify its significant place in music history.</description>
