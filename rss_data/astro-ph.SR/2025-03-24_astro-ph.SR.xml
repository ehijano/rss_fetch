      <title>Integral field spectroscopy of the planetary nebula NGC 3242 and the puzzling nature of its low ionization structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physico-chemical properties of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 3242 are investigated in both 1D and 2D, using Integral Field Unit (IFU) data. This PN has a complex morphology with multiple shells and contains a pair of structures with a lower degree of ionization compared to the main nebular components. These structures are known as low ionization structures (LISs), and their origin is still a mystery. With the capabilities provided by IFU spectroscopy, we aim to gain a better understanding of the behavior of nebular properties in the LISs. Data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) were used in order to perform a spatially resolved physico-chemical analysis of NGC 3242 both in 2D, through the analysis of emission line maps, and in 1D, simulating long-slit spectroscopy, with pseudo-slits. Through the deeper investigation of MUSE data, we detect new structures perpendicular to the pair of LISs of NGC 3242, which are mainly seen in the light of [S III] and [N II]. In addition, two arc-like structures are revealed. Moreover, an inner jet-like structure is found through its [Fe III] emission. The interaction of the jet with the rim may be related to the formation of knots and blobs. The higher value of Te, is estimated from the [S III] diagnostic lines, followed by Te ([N II]), Te(H I) and finally Te (He I). In all cases, Te is higher at the inner nebular structures. Regarding electron density, ne, is lower at the LISs, while an increase is observed at the nebular rim. Diagnostic diagrams confirm that NGC 3242 is a highly ionized nebula. Moreover, the MUSE data unveiled for the first time in this PN, the atomic line [C I] {\lambda}8727, primarily emitted from the LISs. This finding suggests that these structures may consist of a molecular core surrounded by neutral and ionized gas</description>

      <title>NEIDSpecMatch: stellar parameter estimation with NEID spectra using an empirical library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NEIDSpecMatch, a tool developed to extract stellar parameters from spectra obtained with the NEID spectrograph. NEIDSpecMatch is based on SpecMatch-Emp and HPFSpecMatch, which estimate stellar parameters by comparing the observed spectrum to well-characterized library spectra. This approach has proven effective for M dwarfs. Utilizing a library of 78 stellar spectra covering effective temperatures from $3000-6000$ K, NEIDSpecMatch derives key parameters, including effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Cross-validation shows median uncertainties of $\sigma_{T_{\mathrm{eff}}} = 115\,\mathrm{K}$, $\sigma_{[\mathrm{Fe/H}]} = 0.143$, and $\sigma_{\log g} = 0.073$ across 49 orders. We showcase its application by fitting the spectrum of an M-dwarf and discuss its utility across a wide range of spectra observed with NEID. NEIDSpecMatch is pip-installable.</description>

      <title>Testing the bloated star hypothesis in the massive young stellar object IRAS 19520+2759 through optical and infrared variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using optical time series with Telescopi Joan Or\'o (TJO), Gaia, TESS, and NEOWISE archival data, we performed a variability study on the candidate bloated massive young stellar object (MYSO) IRAS 19520+2759. This is the first time that a bloated star candidate has been tested for the theoretically predicted periodic variability. The source is found to be variable at optical and mid-infrared wavelengths and classified as a long-period variable MYSO. The observed TJO data gives a period of the source of $\sim$ 270$\pm$40 days (in the Rc band) and $\sim$ 270$\pm$50 days (in the Ic band), which is very close to the value predicted by the theoretical Period-Luminosity relation for a bloated young star of $\sim 10^5 L\odot$. Additionally, a large period of $\sim$ 460$\pm$80 days (in the G band) and $\sim$ 440$\pm$70 (in the Rp band) is also visible in the Gaia light curve. The physical parameters of the source, such as mass, radius, and accretion rate, based on the theoretical predictions for the spherical accretion case and corresponding to a period of 270--460 days, are $\sim 24$--28$\,M\odot$, $\sim 650$--900$\,R\odot$ and $\sim (6$--$9)\times10^{-3}\,M\odot yr^{-1}$. However, these numbers are very sensitive to the effective temperatures assumed in the models. Additionally, these values strongly depend on the geometry of accretion and could significantly decrease for the case of a MYSO accreting through a disc. The observed periodic variability, the observed colour trend, and the nature of the variability are found to be consistent with the pulsational model for a bloated MYSO.</description>

      <title>An attempt to determine the magnetic field configuration in the planetary nebula K 3-35 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined dust polarisation within the planetary nebula (PN) K 3-35 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). This investigation aimed to identify and trace the magnetic field within the PN, as it potentially plays a crucial role in shaping this bipolar nebula. Our findings include a marginal detection of the polarised region and low fractional polarisation (peaking at 1.4%). Assuming a certain level of validity, we observed well-organised dust grains aligned along the equatorial plane of the PN, indicating a magnetic field alignment with the outflows. The limited polarisation detection at submillimeter wavelengths in this PN and others may be attributed to a pronounced optical depth. However, our K 3-35 analysis with the code DUSTY does not seem to support this idea. We also modelled the SED of K3-35, and our best-fit models included a mixture of silicates and amorphous carbon. The grains of amorphous carbon are less susceptible to alignment with the magnetic field, which could, at least partially, explain the observed low polarisation. The models presented in this article should be considered preliminary, and a more advanced approach is needed for a more complete interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>Observational Comparison Between Confined and Eruptive Flares: Magnetohydrodynamics Instability Parameters in a Similar Magnetic Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstable states of the solar coronal magnetic field structure result in various flare behaviors. In this study, we compared the confined and eruptive flares that occurred under similar magnetic circumstances in the active region 12673, on 2017 September 6, using the twist number, decay index, and height of magnetic field lines to identify observational behaviors of the flare eruption. We investigated the parameters from the magnetic field lines involved in an initial energy release, which were identified from the positions of the core of flare ribbons, i.e., flare kernels. The magnetic field lines were derived by nonlinear force-free field modeling calculated from the photospheric vector magnetic field obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, and flare kernels were identified from the 1600 angstrom data obtained by the SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. The twist number of all the magnetic field lines in the confined flare was below 0.6; however, the twist number in seven out of twenty-four magnetic field lines in the eruptive flare was greater than 0.6. These lines were tall. It is found that the decay index is not a clear discriminator of the confined and eruptive flares. Our study suggests that some magnetic field lines in the kink instability state may be important for eruptive flares, and that taller magnetic field lines may promote flare eruption.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the origin of the elements. IX. 3D NLTE abundances of metals in the context of Galactic Chemical Evolution Models and 4MOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, various methods have been employed to understand the origin of the elements, including observations of elemental abundances which have been compared to Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. It is also well known that 1D Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) measurements fail to accurately capture elemental abundances. Non-LTE (NLTE) effects may play a significant role, and neglecting them leads to erroneous implications in galaxy modelling. In this paper, we calculate 3D NLTE abundances of seven key iron-peak and neutron-capture elements (Mn, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, Eu) based on carefully assembled 1D LTE literature measurements, and investigate their impact within the context of the OMEGA+ GCE model. Our findings reveal that 3D NLTE abundances are significantly higher for iron-peak elements at [Fe/H]&lt; -3, with (for the first time ever) [Ni/Fe] and (confirming previous studies) [Co/Fe] on average reaching 0.6-0.8 dex, and [Mn/Fe] reaching -0.1 dex, which current 1D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models cannot explain. We also observe a slightly higher production of neutron-capture elements at low metallicities, with 3D NLTE abundances of Eu being higher by +0.2 dex at [Fe/H]= -3. 3D effects are most significant for iron-peak elements in the very metal-poor regime, with average differences between 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE {reaching} up to 0.15 dex. Thus, ignoring 3D NLTE effects introduces significant biases, so including {them} should be considered whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Prompt Stellar and Binary Black Hole Mergers from Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-period massive binary stars are predicted to undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), making them prime candidates for producing binary black holes (BBHs) that may merge within the age of the Universe. Most of these binaries have a tertiary companion, and here we explore how a nearby third body possibly influences this evolutionary channel. Our analysis combines analytic treatments of triple dynamics with insights from detailed stellar evolution models, focusing on the role of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism while also accounting for tidal and general relativistic apsidal precession. We examine the dynamics of triples at three critical evolutionary stages: the zero-age main sequence, shortly after the main sequence, and at the time of BBH formation. We find that, for triples having outer orbital periods less than 70 d(120 d), the inner binary can merge during(or after) the main-sequence stage, leading to a hydrogen-rich(helium-rich) stellar merger. If a stellar merger is avoided, the inner binary may eventually form a BBH. In mildly hierarchical triples, with outer periods of around 100 d, the tertiary component can trigger a rapid merger of the BBH on timescales comparable to the outer orbital period. Stellar tides play a crucial role in determining the fate of the inner binary in such tight triple systems, as they can suppress the perturbative effects of the third star. When tidal forces damp the oscillations induced by the tertiary, the BBH merger may occur soon after stellar collapse. Notably, these outcomes are not restricted to CHE binaries but can also apply to any BBH formed from stars in tight orbits. Mergers in these systems are characterized by the proximity of a tertiary companion and the presence of recently ejected gas, making them promising candidates for electromagnetic counterparts and gravitational-wave signals influenced by nearby tertiary objects.</description>

      <title>TESS light curves and period changes in low-mass eclipsing binary BB Persei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the low-mass detached eclipsing binary system BB Persei, which contains two K-type stars in a circular orbit with a short period of 0.4856 d. We used light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which observed BB Per in five sectors, to determine its photometric properties and a precise orbital ephemeris. The solution of the TESS light curve in Phoebe results in a detached configuration, where the temperature of the primary component was fixed to $T_1 = 5~300$ K according to Lamost, which gives us $T_2 = 5~050 \pm 50$ K for the secondary. The spectral type of the primary component was derived as K0 and the photometric mass ratio was estimated $q = 0.90$. Slow period changes on the current O-C diagram spanning the past 25 years indicate the presence of a third body orbiting the eclipsing pair with an orbital period of about 22 years. The companion could be a red dwarf of spectral type M6 - M7 with a minimal mass of about 0.1 M$_{\odot}$. The characteristics and temporal variation of the dark region on the surface of the secondary component were estimated.</description>

      <title>Tidal Amplitudes in the Magellanic Cloud Population of Heartbeat Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heartbeat (HB) stars exhibit pulses in their light curves once per orbit due to ellipsoidal distortions from strong tides at periapse. We analyze the population of HB stars in the Magellanic Clouds captured by the OGLE survey, and provide broadband spectral energy distribution fitting to estimate physical properties of the HB stars. The HB stars span a wide range of luminosities, radii, and effective temperatures. However, we find that they cluster near loci of strong tidal influence at periapse, indicating that in nearly all cases, strong tides are indeed responsible for their photometric variability. HB stars tend to populate regions away from the main sequence, where stellar evolution is particularly rapid. We examine the distribution of tidal amplitudes, and show that these can be interpreted through a simplified model of radius growth through stellar evolution and orbital circularization through linear tidal dissipation. When we compare rates of tidal dissipation, we find differences between the modeled modified tidal quality factor among hot ($T_{\rm eff}&gt;6250$~K), $Q_\ast' \gtrsim 10^7$, and cool ($T_{\rm eff}&lt;6250$~K), $Q_\ast'\sim 10^5$, stars, which is qualitatively consistent with models of efficient tidal dissipation in the convective envelopes of cool stars. We find that this model can reproduce the observed observed locations and amplitudes of HB stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The hot stars, in particular, extend to amplitudes near, but not beyond, the threshold for nonlinear tidal wave breaking on stellar surfaces, suggesting a physical saturation of tidal amplitudes at this threshold.</description>

      <title>Melnick 39 is a very massive intermediate-period colliding-wind binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individually identified binary systems of very massive stars define fixed points on possible evolutionary pathways that begin with extreme star formation and end in either coalescence of compact remnants or complete disruption as pair-production supernovae. The LMC star Melnick 39 in the Tarantula Nebula is revealed to be an eccentric ($e = 0.618\pm0.014$) binary system of reasonably long period from time-series analysis of Chandra T-ReX X-ray observations. Its X-ray luminosity scales with the inverse of the binary separation, as expected for colliding-wind binaries in the adiabatic regime. The inclusion of optical time-series spectroscopy from the VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey and archival HST spectroscopy confirms Melnick 39 as a double-lined O2.5If/WN6+O3V-III spectroscopic binary with orbital period near 648 days. We obtain a mass ratio of $q = 0.76 \pm 0.06$, and minimum dynamical masses of $105\pm11$ and $80\pm11$ $M_{solar}$ for the O2.5If/WN6 and O3V-III components, plus photometric evidence for an orbital inclination near 90 degrees. Disentangled spectroscopy allows the physical and wind properties of the primary to be determined, including $T_{\ast}$ = 44 kK, $\log L/L_{solar}$ = 6.2, $\log \dot{M}/M_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ = $-5.0$. Its dynamical mass agrees closely with $109 M_{solar}$ obtained from the mass-luminosity relation of very massive stars.</description>

      <title>A "Black Hole Star" Reveals the Remarkable Gas-Enshrouded Hearts of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical processes that led to the formation of billion solar mass black holes within the first 700 million years of cosmic time remain a puzzle. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a "black hole star" (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free "atmosphere" around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super-Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-line Analysis of the Distribution and Excitation of CS and H$_2$CS in the HD 163296 Disk</title>

Abstract: The abundance and distribution of sulfur-bearing molecules in protoplanetary disks directly influences the composition and potential habitability of nascent planets in addition to providing powerful probes of the physical gas conditions in the disks themselves. Here, we present new and archival ALMA and SMA observations of CS and H$_2$CS, and their C$^{34}$S and H$_2$C$^{34}$S isotopologues, at high-angular resolution (${\approx}$0."2-0."4; 20-40 au) in the HD 163296 disk, which reveal a central cavity and multi-ringed emission structure. These observations comprise the most comprehensive, multi-line CS data in a planet-forming disk to date, spanning a wide range of excitation conditions from E$_{\rm{u}}$=7.1 K to 129.3 K, and include new detections of C$^{34}$S, H$_2$CS, and H$_2$C$^{34}$S in this system. Using these data, we derive spatially-resolved rotational temperature and column density profiles for all species. We find a column density ratio N(H$_2$CS)/N(CS) $\approx$ 0.5, which is comparable to that of the similar MWC 480 disk and suggests that organic sulfur compounds may constitute a large fraction of the volatile sulfur reservoir in disks around Herbig stars generally. We derive $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios of ${\approx}$5 (CS/C$^{34}$S) and ${\approx}$2 (H$_2$CS/H$_2$C$^{34}$S) based on disk-averaged and spatially-resolved analyses. Both values are consistent across these two pairs of optically-thin molecules and are well-below the expected ISM ratio of ${\approx}$22, suggesting significant sulfur fractionation. We also constrain the CS emitting layer ($z/r\lesssim 0.1$) using the vertical separations of the disk surfaces in the channel maps and based on the known 2D gas structure of the HD 163296 disk combined with our excitation analysis.</description>

      <title>AREPO-IDORT: Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport for Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics on an Unstructured Moving Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation is crucial not only for observing astrophysical objects, but also for transporting energy and momentum. However, accurate on-the-fly radiation transport in astrophysical simulations is challenging and computationally expensive. Here we introduce AREPO-IDORT (Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport), a scheme coupled to the explicit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver in the 3D moving-mesh code AREPO. The discrete ordinates scheme means we directly solve for the specific intensities along discrete directions. We solve the time-dependent relativistic radiation transport equation via an implicit Jacobi-like iterative finite-volume solver, which overcomes the small radiation time-steps needed by explicit methods. Compared to commonly-used moment-based methods, e.g. flux-limited diffusion or M1 closure, this scheme has the advantage of correctly capturing the direction of radiation in both optically-thick and thin regions. It is based on the scheme by Jiang 2021 for the adaptive mesh refinement code ATHENA++, but we generalize the scheme to support (1) an unstructured moving-mesh, (2) local time-stepping, and (3) general equations of state. We show various test problems that commonly-used moment-based methods fail to reproduce accurately. To apply the scheme to a real astrophysics problem, we show the first global 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the entire convective envelope of a red supergiant star. (abridged) For this problem, the radiation module only takes less than half of the total computational cost. Our current scheme assumes grey radiation, is first-order accurate in both time and space (abridged). We expect our scheme will enable more accurate multi-scale radiation MHD simulations involving supersonic bulk motions, ranging from planet formation in protoplanetary disks, stars and associated transients, to accretion flows near black holes.</description>

      <title>Surveys of clumps, cores, and condensations in Cygnus-X: Searching for Keplerian disks on the scale of 500 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, observational evidence of circumstellar disks around massive protostars has been steadily accumulating. However, there have also been cases of non-detections in high-mass star-forming regions, leaving the role and prevalence of disks around massive protostars still uncertain. We used high-resolution (0.2") NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations to study the 1.3 mm continuum and molecular line emission of five massive dense cores in the Cygnus-X cloud complex. Four cores host 2000-au-scale rotating structures previously identified as disk candidates in lower-resolution SMA observations, while the remaining core with no evidence for a disk serves as a comparison. With a resolution of 300 au, the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals varying levels of fragmentation in our sample, with fragment radii ranging from 150 to 800 AU. In this work, we confirm the existence of two small, stable disks in Keplerian-like rotation at scales of 500 au out of four previously identified disk candidates from the SMA observations at coarser resolution. The lack of evidence for Keplerian disks in other disk candidates identified from the SMA data suggests that rotational signatures observed at 2000 au scales do not necessarily imply the presence of Keplerian disks at smaller scales. Therefore, higher-resolution and higher-sensitivity observations are essential to definitively identify Keplerian disks on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). III. Retrieval of Planetary Masses in Binaries Using the N-body Model with RV and Astrometry Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given that secular perturbations in a binary system not only excite high orbital eccentricities but also alter the planetary orbital inclination, the classical Keplerian orbital model is no longer applicable for orbital retrieval. The combination of a dynamical model and observational data is essential for characterizing the configuration and planetary mass in close binaries. We calculate the theoretical radial velocity (RV) signal in the N-body framework and observe a drift in the RV semi-amplitude, which leads to a reduction in the $m$sin$i$ detection threshold by 20 $M_{\oplus}$, with $\sim$ 100% detection probability in the $m_1$sin$i_1$-$a_1$ parameter space. High-precision RV data with an accuracy of 1 m/s can detect such dynamical effects. For four close-in binaries-GJ 86, GJ 3021, HD 196885, and HD 41004, the deviation between the minimum mass derived from the Keplerian and N-body models is found to be $&gt; 0.2 ~ M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. High-precision astrometric data are also necessary to resolve the 3D orbits and true masses exoplanets. We generate astrometric simulation data with accuracies corresponding to Gaia (57.8 $\mu$as) and the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) (1 $\mu$as), respectively. Joint orbit fitting is performed for RV + Gaia and RV + CHES synergy methods. Compared with the fitting results from the astrometry-only model, the synergy models more effectively constrain the range of orbital inclinations. Using simulation data, we derive precise uncertainties for the true planetary mass, which are critical for determining the evolution of planets around binary stars and multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Observations of complex organic molecules in the gas phase of the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the advent of sensitive and broad bandwidth instrumentation, complex organic molecules (COMs) have been found in a wide variety of interstellar environments, not only in our Galaxy but also in external galaxies up to a redshift of 0.89. The detection of COMs in cold environments such as starless or prestellar cores has challenged our understanding of COM formation and new ideas are being implemented in chemical models and explored in laboratory experiments. At the protostellar stage, the advent of new interferometers such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has allowed the mapping of the weak emission of COMs in the protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks around both low-mass and high-mass protostars, pinpointing their location and revealing differentiation between the different families of molecules. In this way, thermal and non-thermal desorption mechanisms can be probed, constraining the efficiency of formation of COMs in the gas phase versus on grain surfaces. Some degree of continuity in the COM composition is found from the early to late stages of star formation, suggesting that a significant fraction of COMs are formed at the initial conditions of star formation. For extreme environments such as the Galactic Center, cosmic rays and low-velocity shocks seem to influence the COM composition of low and high-density gas components. The spectral confusion limit will be a major challenge for the detection of new COMs in future spectroscopic surveys. However, low-frequency interferometers targeting sources with low-excitation temperatures may help to overcome this limit.</description>

      <title>Dipole Polarizability of Finite Nuclei as a Probe of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>On the manifest link between Terzan 5 and the Galactic bulge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the chemical link between Terzan 5 (hereafter Ter5) and the Bulge, as probed by the observed distributions of [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios with varying [Fe/H] and by suitable statistical tests to evaluate their significance. We also present a comprehensive review of the kinematic and evolutionary properties of Ter5, based on all the available observational signatures and the scenarios proposed so far in the literature for the formation and evolution of Ter5, based on these observational facts and the recent modeling of its star formation and chemical enrichment history. This analysis confirms the complex nature of this massive stellar system, with robust evidences of a bulge in-situ formation and of a subsequent evolution that cannot be simply explained by a single merging/accretion event of two globulars or a globular and a giant molecular cloud, as proposed in the literature, but it requires a more complex star formation likely accompanied by some self-enrichment.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency trends in HPC: what high-energy and astrophysicists need to know</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing energy demands of HPC systems have made energy efficiency a critical concern for system developers and operators. However, HPC users are generally less aware of how these energy concerns influence the design, deployment, and operation of supercomputers even though they experience the consequences. This paper examines the implications of HPC's energy consumption, providing an overview of current trends aimed at improving energy efficiency. We describe how hardware innovations such as energy-efficient processors, novel system architectures, power management techniques, and advanced scheduling policies do have a direct impact on how applications need to be programmed and executed on HPC systems. For application developers, understanding how these new systems work and how to analyse and report the performances of their own software is critical in the dialog with HPC system designers and administrators. The paper aims to raise awareness about energy efficiency among users, particularly in the high energy physics and astrophysics domains, offering practical advice on how to analyse and optimise applications to reduce their energy consumption without compromising on performance.</description>

      <title>Constraining Extra Mixing during the Main Sequence: What Depletes Lithium Does Not Touch Beryllium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of lithium abundances in solar-type stars have shown that standard models of stellar evolution are incapable of explaining the observed depletion as a function of stellar age. Beryllium is one of the lightest elements that can be measured in stellar photospheres, and it can be burned in relatively low temperatures. Studying its abundances as a function of stellar age can provide important constraints to stellar mixing models, as the level of depletion as a function of time will indicate how deep the photospheric material must be dredged to explain the observed abundances. In an effort to provide the most stringent constraints for non-standard stellar mixing models, we observed a sample of solar-twins and concomitantly analyzed their lithium and beryllium abundances. Unlike what is typically observed for lithium, we found that beryllium does not decrease as a function of stellar age along the main-sequence, constraining models that predict burning of both materials. Based on our data, models that invoke convective overshoot and convective settling are preferred over typical rotationaly-induced mixing models, as the later burn Be in excess while the former do not. Previous works also proposed mixing due to gravity waves as a possible explanation for observed abundances, which can fit our data as well. Furthermore, based on our solar twins, Be depletion likely happens within the first $\sim1$ Gyr. We also confirm previous findings of an increase in Be abundance as a function of metallicity, indicative of galactic production via cosmic ray spallation.</description>

      <title>Using nebular near-IR spectroscopy to measure asymmetric chemical distributions in 2003fg-like thermonuclear supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of three near-infrared (NIR; 1.0-2.4 $\mu$m) spectra of the SN 2003fg-like/"super-Chandrasekhar" type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) SN 2009dc, SN 2020hvf, and SN 2022pul at respective phases +372, +296, and +294~d relative to the epoch of $B$-band maximum. We find that all objects in our sample have asymmetric, or "tilted", [Fe~II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m profiles. We quantify the asymmetry of these features using five methods: velocity at peak flux, profile tilts, residual testing, velocity fitting, and comparison to deflagration-detonation transition models. Our results demonstrate that, while the profiles of the [Fe II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m features are widely varied between 2003fg-likes, these features are correlated in shape within the same SN. This implies that line blending is most likely not the dominant cause of the asymmetries inferred from these profiles. Instead, it is more plausible that 2003fg-like SNe have aspherical chemical distributions in their inner regions. These distributions may come from aspherical progenitor systems, such as double white dwarf mergers, or off-center delayed-detonation explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. Additional late-phase NIR observation of 2003fg-like SNe and detailed 3-D NLTE modeling of these two explosion scenarios are encouraged.</description>

      <title>The Way To Circumbinary Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) are planets that orbit around both stars of a binary system. This chapter traces the history of research on CBPs and provides an overview over the current knowledge about CBPs and their detection methods. After early speculations about CBPs, inspired by binary star systems and popularized by fictional works, their scientific exploration began with the identification of circumbinary dust disks and progressed to the detection and characterization of the current sample of CBPs. The major part of this review presents the detection methods for CBPs: eclipse timing variations from the light-travel-time effect and from dynamical interactions, transits, radial velocities, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing and astrometry. Each of these methods is described with its strengths and limitations and the main characeristics of the CBP systems found by them are outlined. The potential habitability of CBPs is considered, taking into account the unique environmental conditions created by orbiting a stellar binary. The importance of multi-method detection strategies is underscored, and future advancements from upcoming missions like PLATO are anticipated, promising to expand the understanding of these intriguing celestial bodies.</description>
