      <title>A Computational Method for Solving the Stochastic Joint Replenishment Problem in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time formulation for a class of high-dimensional stochastic joint replenishment problems. First, we approximate the problem by a continuous-time impulse control problem. Exploiting connections among the impulse control problem, backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps, and the stochastic target problem, we develop a novel, simulation-based computational method that relies on deep neural networks to solve the impulse control problem. Based on that solution, we propose an implementable inventory control policy for the original (discrete-time) stochastic joint replenishment problem, and test it against the best available benchmarks in a series of test problems. For the problems studied thus far, our method matches or beats the best benchmark we could find, and it is computationally feasible up to at least 50 dimensions -- that is, 50 stock-keeping units (SKUs).</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Imitation and Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Benders Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an end-to-end graph-based agent for accelerating the computational efficiency of Benders Decomposition. The agent's policy is parameterized by a graph neural network which takes as input a bipartite graph representation of the master problem and proposes a candidate solution. The agent is trained using a two-stage approach that combines imitation (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL). IL is used to mimic a solver and obtain a warm-start policy which is then finetuned using RL with a reward signal that balances feasibility and computational efficiency. We augment the agent with a verification mechanism that checks the agent's prediction for feasibility and solution quality. The framework is evaluated in two case studies: (i) an illustrative mixed-integer nonlinear program, where it reduces the solution time by 42% without loss of solution quality, and (ii) a closed-loop irrigation scheduling problem, where it achieves a 23% time reduction without compromising water use efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Time Derivative of the KL Divergence for a Generalized Langevin Annealing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Langevin diffusion process $\d X_t = \nabla \log p_t(X_t) + \sqrt{2}\d W_t$ guided by the time-dependent probability density $p_t(x)$. Let $q_t$ be the density of $X_t$. Recently, in order to analyze convergence in the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the time derivative of $t\mapsto \KL(q_t|p_t)$ has been used in several works without investigating in detail when such a derivative exists. In this short manuscript we provide a rigorous derivation of the quantity $\frac{\d}{\d t}\KL(q_t|p_t)$.</description>

      <title>Extremum-Seeking Boundary Control for Schr\"odinger-Type PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design and analysis of an extremum-seeking (ES) controller for scalar static maps in the context of infinite-dimensional dynamics governed by complex-valued partial differential equations (PDEs) of Schrodinger type. The system is actuated at one boundary, and the map input is defined as a real-valued quadratic functional corresponding to the squared norm of the complex state at the uncontrolled boundary. An isomorphism between the complex Hilbert space and its two-dimensional real-valued representation is established to enable the use of the standard multivariable Newton-based ES method. To compensate for the PDE actuation dynamics, a boundary control strategy based on a two-step backstepping procedure is employed. With a perturbation-based estimate of the Hessian inverse, the local exponential stability to a small neighborhood of the unknown extremum point is proved. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed extremum-seeking methodology.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning with Safety and L2 Stability Certificates for Boundary Control of Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an imitation learning (IL) framework for synthesizing neural network (NN) controllers that achieve boundary stabilization of systems governed by reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs). The plant is assumed to be actuated through a Dirichlet boundary condition and subject to a Neumann condition on the unactuated side. The design is based on a finite-dimensional truncated model that captures the unstable dynamics of the original infinite-dimensional system, which is obtained via spectral decomposition. Convex stability and safety conditions are then derived for this truncated model by combining Lyapunov theory with local quadratic constraints (QC), which bound the nonlinear activation functions of the NN and guarantee robustness to model truncation, thus addressing the spillover problem. These conditions are integrated into the IL process to jointly minimize the imitation loss and maximize the volume of the certified region of attraction (ROA). The proposed framework is validated on an unstable reaction-diffusion PDE, demonstrating that the resulting NN controller efficiently reproduces the expert policy while ensuring formal stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>Generalized gradient flows in Hadamard manifolds and convex optimization on entanglement polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the optimization problem of minimizing $Q(df_x)$ over a Hadamard manifold ${\cal M}$, where $f$ is a convex function on ${\cal M}$, $df_x$ is the differential of $f$ at $x \in {\cal M}$, and $Q$ is a function on the cotangent bundle of ${\cal M}$. This problem generalizes the problem of minimizing the gradient norm $\|\nabla f(x)\|$ over ${\cal M}$, studied by Hirai and Sakabe FOCS2024. We formulate a natural class of $Q$ in terms of convexity and invariance under parallel transports, and introduce a generalization of the gradient flow of $f$ that is expected to minimize $Q(df_x)$. For basic classes of manifolds, including the product of the manifolds of positive definite matrices, we prove that this gradient flow attains $\inf_{x\in {\cal M}} Q(df_x)$ in the limit, and yields a duality relation. This result is applied to the Kempf-Ness optimization for GL-actions on tensors, which is Euclidean convex optimization on the class of moment polytopes, known as the entanglement polytopes. This type of convex optimization arises from tensor-related subjects in theoretical computer science, such as quantum functional, $G$-stable rank, and noncommutative rank.</description>

      <title>Efficiency and Convergence Insights in Large-Scale Optimization Using the Improved Inexact-Newton-Smart Algorithm and Interior-Point Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a head-to-head evaluation of the Improved Inexact--Newton--Smart (INS) algorithm against a primal--dual interior-point framework for large-scale nonlinear optimization. On extensive synthetic benchmarks, the interior-point method converges with roughly one third fewer iterations and about one half the computation time relative to INS, while attaining marginally higher accuracy and meeting all primary stopping conditions. By contrast, INS succeeds in fewer cases under default settings but benefits markedly from moderate regularization and step-length control; in tuned regimes its iteration count and runtime decrease substantially, narrowing yet not closing the gap. A sensitivity study indicates that interior-point performance remains stable across parameter changes, whereas INS is more affected by step length and regularization choice. Collectively, the evidence positions the interior-point method as a reliable baseline and INS as a configurable alternative when problem structure favors adaptive regularization.</description>

      <title>Novel Multi-objective Switched Model Predictive Control with Feasibility and Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the relevance of control systems capable of dealing with multiple objectives rises (e.g. being economic while maintaining a certain performance), multi-objective Switched Model Predictive Control combines all the advantages of Model Predictive Control while dealing with multiple objectives. We propose two novel frameworks, a nominal and a robust framework to guarantee recursive feasibility of each Model Predictive Controller under arbitrary switching and assure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system applying the nominal framework and Input-to-State stability using the robust framework. The presented frameworks employ methods from switched systems, enabling the utilization of a supervisor control instance which allows for complex objectives and multi-objective control. Our numerical example confirms the superior performance of our proposed frameworks compared to a standard Model Predictive Control approach.</description>

      <title>Optimization landscape of $\ell_0$-Bregman relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study (noisy) linear systems, and their $\ell_0$-regularized optimization problems, coupled with general data fidelity terms. Recent approaches for solving this class of problems have proposed to consider non-convex exact continuous relaxations that preserve global minimizers while reducing the number of local minimizers. Within this framework, we consider the class of $\ell_0$-Bregman relaxations, and establish sufficient conditions under which a critical point is isolated in terms of sparsity, in the sense that any other critical point has a strictly larger cardinality. In this way, we ensure a form of uniqueness in the solution structure. Furthermore, we analyze the exact recovery properties of such exact relaxations. To that end, we derive conditions under which the oracle solution (i.e., the one sharing the same support as the ground-truth) is the unique global minimizer of the relaxed problem, and is isolated in terms of sparsity. Our analysis is primarily built upon a novel property we introduce, termed the Bregman Restricted Strong Convexity. Finally, we specialize our general results to both sparse Gaussian (least-squares) and Poisson ((generalized) Kullback-Leibler divergence) regression problems. In particular, we show that our general analysis sharpens existing bounds for the LS setting, while providing an entirely new result for the KL case.</description>

      <title>Computation of a Consistent System Matrix for Cone-beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for the computation of a consistent system matrix for two- and three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (CT). The method relies on the decomposition of the cone-voxel intersection volumes into subvolumes that contribute to distinct detector elements and whose contributions to the system matrix admit exact formulae that can be evaluated without the invocation of costly iterative subroutines. We demonstrate that the reconstructions obtained when using the proposed system matrix are superior to those obtained when using common line-based integration approaches with numerical experiments on synthetic and real CT data. Moreover, we provide a CUDA implementation of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Safe and Operationally Efficient Longitudinal Control of Autonomous Truck Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical longitudinal control architecture for autonomous truck platoons that jointly addresses safety, string stability, and economic efficiency. The framework integrates a high-rate safety projection filter, a spacing-regulation layer based on a lag-aware proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and a slow-timescale economic optimizer balancing fuel consumption and travel time. The safety layer guarantees collision avoidance under bounded actuation delays by enforcing forward invariance of a velocity-aware headway constraint through a high-order control barrier function. The regulation layer shapes the spacing-error dynamics into a second-order form with interpretable parameters for damping and natural frequency while explicitly accounting for actuator lag. At the macroscopic level, fuel use is modeled by a tractive-power relation that captures aerodynamic benefits of close spacing, enabling a long-term optimization of speed trajectories subject to comfort and energy trade-offs. We show that the closed-loop dynamics converge to the Optimal Velocity Model with Relative Velocity (OVRV) under undisturbed conditions and derive worst-case upper bounds for platoon stabilization time. Numerical case studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over an canonical baseline controllers in both transient behavior and long-term energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Parameterized complexity of scheduling unit-time jobs with generalized precedence constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of scheduling unit-time jobs on parallel, identical machines under generalized precedence constraints for minimization of the makespan and the sum of completion times. In our setting, each job is equipped with a Boolean formula (precedence constraint) over the set of jobs. A schedule satisfies a job's precedence constraint if setting earlier jobs to true satisfies the formula. Our definition generalizes several common types of precedence constraints: classical and-constraints if every formula is a conjunction, or-constraints if every formula is a disjunction, and and/or-constraints if every formula is in conjunctive normal form. We prove fixed-parameter tractability when parameterizing by the number of predecessors. For parameterization by the number of successors, however, the complexity depends on the structure of the precedence constraints. If every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction, we prove the problem to be fixed-parameter tractable. For constraints in disjunctive normal form, we prove W[1]-hardness. We show that the and/or-constrained problem is NP-hard, even for a single successor. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction. This result not only proves para-NP-hardness for parameterization by the number of machines but also complements the polynomial-time solvability on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction (Coffman and Graham 1972) or if every constraint is a disjunction (Berit 2005).</description>

      <title>Set System Approximation for Binary Integer Programs: Reformulations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covering and elimination inequalities are central to combinatorial optimization, yet their role has largely been studied in problem-specific settings or via no-good cuts. This paper introduces a unified perspective that treats these inequalities as primitives for set system approximation in binary integer programs (BIPs). We show that arbitrary set systems admit tight inner and outer monotone approximations, exactly corresponding to covering and elimination inequalities. Building on this, we develop a toolkit that both recovers classical structural correspondences (e.g., paths vs. cuts, spanning trees vs. cycles) and extends polyhedral tools from set covering to general BIPs, including facet conditions and lifting methods. We also propose new reformulation techniques for nonlinear and latent monotone systems, such as auxiliary-variable-free bilinear linearization, bimonotone cuts, and interval decompositions. A case study on distributionally robust network site selection illustrates the framework's flexibility and computational benefits. Overall, this unified view clarifies inner/outer approximation criteria, extends classical polyhedral analysis, and provides broadly applicable reformulation strategies for nonlinear BIPs.</description>

      <title>Performance and Risk Analytics of Asian Exchange-Traded Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investing in Asian markets through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provides investors with access to rapidly expanding economies and valuable diversification opportunities. This study examines the advantages and challenges of investing in Asian ETFs by conducting comprehensive risk assessments, portfolio analyses, and performance comparisons. The dataset comprises 29 ETFs offering exposure across a wide spectrum of Asian markets, including broad regional funds, country-specific ETFs, as well as sector-focused funds, dividend-oriented ETFs, small-cap portfolios, and emerging market bond ETFs.
  To evaluate risk and return dynamics, the study employs Markowitz's efficient frontier to identify optimal portfolios for given levels of risk, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to capture potential extreme losses for a more comprehensive risk assessment. Multiple portfolio configurations are analyzed under long-only and long-short investment strategies to assess adaptability across varying market conditions. Furthermore, key performance risk measures, including the Sharpe ratio, Rachev ratio, and stable tail-adjusted return ratio (STARR), are calculated to provide an in-depth evaluation of reward-to-risk efficiency, with particular emphasis on the role of tail behavior in portfolio performance.
  This research aims to deliver deeper insights into the risk-return trade-offs, tail-risk behavior, and efficiency of Asian ETFs, offering investors a practical foundation for constructing robust and well-diversified portfolios across both emerging and developed Asian markets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper pioneers the integration of learning optimization into measurement matrix design for phase retrieval. We introduce the Deep Learning-based Measurement Matrix for Phase Retrieval (DLMMPR) algorithm, which parameterizes the measurement matrix within an end-to-end deep learning architecture. Synergistically augmented with subgradient descent and proximal mapping modules for robust recovery, DLMMPR's efficacy is decisively confirmed through comprehensive empirical validation across diverse noise regimes. Benchmarked against DeepMMSE and PrComplex, our method yields substantial gains in PSNR and SSIM, underscoring its superiority.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents and proves an equation for the time horizon of symmetric trajectories with zero boundary conditions and bounded derivatives of arbitrary order. This equation holds regardless of the number of phases comprising the associated motion. This avoids case distinctions in calculations. Application examples of motions with minimum time, minimum velocity, and minimum acceleration are discussed. Furthermore, an algorithm is derived that reduces the time minimization problem to solving a system of equations. This algorithm avoids nested case distinctions and complex optimizations.</description>

      <title>Approximate Tracking Controllability of Systems with Quadratic Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite-dimensional time continuous control system and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we address the question of the existence of controls that maintain the corresponding state trajectories in the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of any prescribed path in the state space. We investigate this property, called approximate tracking controllability, for linear and quadratic time invariant systems. Concerning linear systems, our answers are negative: by developing a systematic approach, we demonstrate that approximate tracking controllability of the full state is impossible even in a certain weak sense, except for the trivial situation where the control space is isomorphic to the state space. Motivated by these negative findings for linear systems, we focus on nonlinear dynamics. In particular, we prove weak approximate tracking controllability on any time horizon for a general class of systems with arbitrary linear part and quadratic nonlinear terms. The considered weak notion of approximate tracking controllability involves the relaxation metric. We underline the relevance of this weak setting by developing applications to coupled systems (including motion planning problems) and by remarking obstructions that would arise for natural stronger norms. The exposed framework yields global results even if the uncontrolled dynamics might exhibit singularities in finite time.</description>

      <title>The iterates of FISTA convergence even under inexact computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently, the papers "Point Convergence of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method: An AI-Assisted Proof" by Jang and Ryu, and "The Iterates of Nesterov's Accelerated Algorithm Converge in the Critical Regimes" by Bot, Fadili, and Nguyen simultaneously have resolved a long-standing open problem concerning Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. These works show that the iterates of the algorithm (known in its composite form as FISTA) indeed converge to an optimal solution. In this work, we extend these results and prove that, in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, the iterates of such an algorithm still converge (in the weak sense) even under inexact computation of the proximity operator and the gradient.</description>

      <title>DIGing--SGLD: Decentralized and Scalable Langevin Sampling over Time--Varying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling from a target distribution induced by training data is central to Bayesian learning, with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) serving as a key tool for scalable posterior sampling and decentralized variants enabling learning when data are distributed across a network of agents. This paper introduces DIGing-SGLD, a decentralized SGLD algorithm designed for scalable Bayesian learning in multi-agent systems operating over time-varying networks. Existing decentralized SGLD methods are restricted to static network topologies, and many exhibit steady-state sampling bias caused by network effects, even when full batches are used. DIGing-SGLD overcomes these limitations by integrating Langevin-based sampling with the gradient-tracking mechanism of the DIGing algorithm, originally developed for decentralized optimization over time-varying networks, thereby enabling efficient and bias-free sampling without a central coordinator. To our knowledge, we provide the first finite-time non-asymptotic Wasserstein convergence guarantees for decentralized SGLD-based sampling over time-varying networks, with explicit constants. Under standard strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, DIGing-SGLD achieves geometric convergence to an $O(\sqrt{\eta})$ neighborhood of the target distribution, where $\eta$ is the stepsize, with dependence on the target accuracy matching the best-known rates for centralized and static-network SGLD algorithms using constant stepsize. Numerical experiments on Bayesian linear and logistic regression validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the strong empirical performance of DIGing-SGLD under dynamically evolving network conditions.</description>

      <title>Electric Truck Platooning with Charging Consideration and Leader Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric trucks are increasingly deployed to reduce the trucking sector's carbon footprint, but their limited range and charging needs create operational challenges on mid- to long-haul routes. Truck platooning can mitigate range anxiety through energy savings and, in turn, influence routing and charging decisions, yet most existing studies focus on a single highway corridor and do not capture network-wide operations. We study electric truck platooning on a general road network, where trucks must select routes and charging stations with heterogeneous prices and charging speeds, form platoons on shared arcs, and possibly take detours that trade off platoon savings with additional labor hours. We further allow in-platoon position swaps so that leading responsibility rotates, balancing battery usage and avoiding early depletion of any single truck. To jointly optimize routing paths, charging-station choices, labor time, and platoon formation and position swaps, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Because exact methods become intractable on realistic instances, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with a savings-based bounding scheme, infeasible-pair elimination, and candidate-station filtering. Computational experiments on test instances with up to 150 trucks show that incorporating platooning can reduce total operational costs by up to 2.77 percent, while the proposed algorithm cuts computation time by up to 99.96 percent compared with CPLEX and solves 150-truck instances in about 120 seconds, indicating strong potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Hidden Modes in Distance-Based Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometric input-output analysis of hidden modes in distance-based formation control. We study the linearized dynamics under a gradient control law to characterize the system's structural limitations and their dynamic consequences. Our main contribution is a unified geometric framework for uncontrollable modes. We first prove that uncontrollable rigid-body modes are pure rotations about the input node, defining a global rotational subspace $\mathcal{R}_i$. To generalize this, we introduce the local rotational subspace, $\mathcal{T}_i$, which contains all motions, including deformations, that are locally invisible to the controller at node $i$. These two geometric objects provide a complete decomposition of the uncontrollable subspace. Finally, we demonstrate the dynamic implications of this structure by proving that the system's ability to recover its shape is determined by an input's alignment with the local component of the standard rotational rigid-body mode, directly linking the geometry of hidden modes to disturbance rejection. We illustrate our results with a case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sampling of functions of bounded variation (BV) is a long-standing problem in op- timization. The ability to sample such functions has relevance in the field of variational inverse problems, where the standard theory fails to guarantee the mere existence of solutions when the loss functional involves samples of BV functions. In this paper, we prove the continuity of sampling functionals and show that the differential operator D admits a unique local inverse. This canonical inversion enables us to formulate an existence theorem for a class of regularized optimization problems that incorporate samples of BV functions. Finally, we characterize the solution set in terms of its extreme points.</description>

      <title>Sparse stabilization of mean-field agent dynamics through a three-operator splitting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sparse stabilization of nonlinear multi-agent systems within a mean-field optimal control framework. The goal is to drive large populations of interacting agents toward consensus with minimal control effort. In the mean-field limit, the dynamics are described by a Vlasov-type kinetic equation, and sparsity is enforced through an l1-l2 penalization in the cost functional. The resulting nonsmooth optimization problem is solved via a three-operator splitting (TOS) method that separately handles smooth, nonsmooth, and constraint components through gradient, shrinkage, and projection steps. A particle-based Monte Carlo discretization with random batch interactions enables scalable computation while preserving the mean-field structure. Numerical experiments on the Cucker-Smale model demonstrate effective consensus formation with sparse, localized control actions, confirming the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Uniform Feasibility For Smoothed Backup Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study feasibility guarantees for safety filters developed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) when a safe set is defined using the pointwise minimum of continuously differentiable functions, a construction that is common for the backup CBF method and typically nonsmooth. We replace the minimum by its log-sum-exp (soft-min) smoothing and show that, under a strict safety condition, the smooth function becomes a CBF (or extended CBF) for a range of the smoothing parameter. For compact safe sets, we derive an explicit lower bound on the smoothing parameter that makes the smooth function a CBF and hence renders the corresponding safety filter feasible. For unbounded sets, we introduce tail conditions under which the smooth function satisfies an extended CBF condition uniformly. Finally, we apply these results to backup CBFs. We show that safety of a compact (terminal) backup set under a backup controller, together with a condition ensuring safety of the backup trajectories on the relevant boundary of the safe set, is sufficient for feasibility for backup CBFs. These results provide a recipe for a priori feasibility guarantees for smooth inner approximations of nonsmooth safe sets without the need for additional online certification.</description>

      <title>A Computationally Efficient Framework for Free-trajectory Minimum-lap-time Optimization of Racing Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a modeling and optimization framework to compute the minimum-lap-time spatial trajectory and powertrain operation of racing cars in a computationally efficient fashion. Specifically, we first derive a quasi-steady-state model of a racing car, whereby the racing line trajectory is jointly optimized. Next, we frame the minimum-lap-time problem and leverage its mostly convex structure by devising a sequential convex programming solution algorithm. We benchmark our method against off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers, showing how it can bring computation time down from a few minutes to a few seconds, paving the way for real-time implementations. Moreover, we compare our results to similarly efficient minimum-curvature racing line optimization methods, showing how a minimum-time-based racing line might lead to 4% faster lap-times. Finally, we showcase our framework for optimal powertrain energy management and we validate the common modeling assumption that the racing line is unaffected by energy limitations, showing that this assumption results in marginal lap-time losses of under 0.1%.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control of Jump-Diffusion Models for Pollution-Dependent Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper develops a unified framework for stochastic growth models with environmental risk, in which rare but catastrophic shocks interact with capital accumulation and pollution. The analysis begins with a Poisson process formulation, leading to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with jump terms that admits closed-form candidate solutions and yields a composite state variable capturing exposure to rare shocks. The framework is then extended by endogenizing disaster intensity via a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, showing how environmental degradation amplifies macroeconomic risk and strengthens incentives for abatement. A further extension introduces pollution diffusion alongside state-dependent jump intensity, yielding a tractable jump-diffusion HJB that decomposes naturally into capital and pollution components under power-type value functions. Finally, a formulation in terms of Poisson random measures unifies the dynamics, makes arrivals and compensators explicit, and accommodates state-dependent magnitudes. Together, these results establish rigorous verification theorems, highlight how vulnerability emerges endogenously from the joint evolution of capital and pollution, and show that the prospect of rare, state-dependent disasters fundamentally reshapes optimal intertemporal trade-offs.</description>

      <title>HBNET-GIANT: A communication-efficient accelerated Newton-type fully distributed optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a second-order fully distributed optimization algorithm, HBNET-GIANT, driven by heavy-ball momentum, for $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex objective functions. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed, and we demonstrate global linear convergence under certain sufficient conditions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that HBNET-GIANT with heavy-ball momentum achieves acceleration, and the corresponding rate of convergence is strictly faster than its non-accelerated version, NETWORK-GIANT. Moreover, we compare HBNET-GIANT with several state-of-the-art algorithms, both momentum-based and without momentum, and report significant performance improvement in convergence to the optimum. We believe that this work lays the groundwork for a broader class of second-order Newton-type algorithms with momentum and motivates further investigation into open problems, including an analytical proof of local acceleration in the fully distributed setting for convex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Power Homotopy for Zeroth-Order Non-Convex Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GS-PowerHP, a novel zeroth-order method for non-convex optimization problems of the form $\max_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)$. Our approach leverages two key components: a power-transformed Gaussian-smoothed surrogate $F_{N,\sigma}(\mu) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2 I_d)}[e^{N f(x)}]$ whose stationary points cluster near the global maximizer $x^*$ of $f$ for sufficiently large $N$, and an incrementally decaying $\sigma$ for enhanced data efficiency. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence in expectation to a small neighborhood of $x^*$ with the iteration complexity of $O(d^2 \varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirical results show our approach consistently ranks among the top three across a suite of competing algorithms. Its robustness is underscored by the final experiment on a substantially high-dimensional problem ($d=150,528$), where it achieved first place on least-likely targeted black-box attacks against images from ImageNet, surpassing all competing methods.</description>

      <title>Subgame Perfect Methods in Nonsmooth Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers nonsmooth convex optimization with either a subgradient or proximal operator oracle. In both settings, we identify algorithms that achieve the recently introduced game-theoretic optimality notion for algorithms known as subgame perfection. Subgame perfect algorithms meet a more stringent requirement than just minimax optimality. Not only must they provide optimal uniform guarantees on the entire problem class, but also on any subclass determined by information revealed during the execution of the algorithm. In the setting of nonsmooth convex optimization with a subgradient oracle, we show that the Kelley cutting plane-Like Method due to Drori and Teboulle [1] is subgame perfect. For nonsmooth convex optimization with a proximal operator oracle, we develop a new algorithm, the Subgame Perfect Proximal Point Algorithm, and establish that it is subgame perfect. Both of these methods solve a history-aware second-order cone program within each iteration, independent of the ambient problem dimension, to plan their next steps. This yields performance guarantees that are never worse than the minimax optimal guarantees and often substantially better.</description>

      <title>Aspiration-based Perturbed Learning Automata in Games with Noisy Utility Measurements. Part A: Stochastic Stability in Non-zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Optimization in Nominally Identical Manufacturing and Measuring Systems for High-Throughput Parallel Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device-to-device variability in experimental noise critically impacts reproducibility, especially in automated, high-throughput systems like additive manufacturing farms. While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability. Overall, this framework establishes a paradigm for precision- and resource-aware optimization in scalable, automated experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Adversarial Sampling: Multi-Armed Bandit-Guided Generalization Against Unforeseen Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to various adversarial perturbations. To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT frameworks primarily focus on a single or a limited set of attack types, leaving DNNs still exposed to attack types that may be encountered in practice but not addressed during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CAS achieves superior overall robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy, providing a new paradigm for robust generalization of DNNs.</description>

      <title>DER Day-Ahead Offering: A Neural Network Column-and-Constraint Generation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the day-ahead energy market, the offering strategy of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators must be submitted before the uncertainty realization in the form of price-quantity pairs. This work addresses the day-ahead offering problem through a two-stage robust adaptive stochastic optimization model, wherein the first-stage price-quantity pairs and second-stage operational commitment decisions are made before and after DER uncertainty is realized, respectively. Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed method yields high-quality solutions and is up to 100 times faster than Gurobi and 33 times faster than classical column-and-constraint generation on the same 1028-node synthetic distribution network.</description>

      <title>On two-degrees-of-freedom agreement protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a distributed two-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) architecture for driving autonomous, possibly heterogeneous, agents to agreement. The scheme mirrors classical servo structures, separating local feedback from network filtering. This separation enables independent network-filter design for prescribed noise attenuation and allows controller heterogeneity to reject local disturbances, including disturbances exciting unstable agreement poles -- which is known to be impossible via standard diffusive couplings. The potential of the framework is illustrated via two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Place n nodes on the unit circle and connect some pairs with springs that pull connected nodes toward each other. Which graphs always drive all nodes to converge to a single point, no matter where they start? This is known as the global synchronization problem of the Kuramoto model and is closely tied to the benign nonconvexity of its synchronization landscape. In this work, we show how this dynamical and continuous question can be reduced to a static and combinatorial one. We prove that threshold graphs, the graph class closed under adding isolated nodes and adding universal nodes, are globally synchronizing, based purely on a combinatorial analysis of unit-vector configurations in the plane. It is particularly striking that threshold graphs range from extremely sparse structures such as stars to the complete graph, suggesting that global synchronization in this class cannot be attributed to density. Our proof shows that global synchronization can instead emerge from a form of geometric symmetry.</description>

      <title>Fully nonlinear second-order mean field games with nondifferentiable Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse fully nonlinear second-order mean field games (MFG) with nondifferentiable Hamiltonians, which take the form of a coupled system of a fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and a Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck partial differential inclusion (PDI) featuring the set-valued subdifferential of the Hamiltonian. We show the existence of solutions of some stationary MFG systems with quite general coupling operators and nonnegative distributional source terms, on general bounded convex domains, under the primary assumptions of uniform ellipticity and the Cordes condition on the diffusion coefficient. The existence proof is founded on an original, and equivalent, reformulation of the PDI as a nonstandard variational inequality (VI), that offers significant flexibility in passages to limits. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the solution of the PDI/VI system is proved in the case of strictly monotone couplings. We then show how the MFG PDI/VI system in the fully nonlinear setting can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of PDE systems with differentiable Hamiltonians, and we give further results on the continuous dependence of the solution.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Adaptive Neural Networks Enable Real-Time Semiconductor Manufacturing Optimization with Minimal Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry faces a computational crisis in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography optimization, where traditional methods consume billions of CPU hours while failing to achieve sub-nanometer precision. We present a physics-constrained adaptive learning framework that automatically calibrates electromagnetic approximations through learnable parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{\theta_d, \theta_a, \theta_b, \theta_p, \theta_c\}$ while simultaneously minimizing Edge Placement Error (EPE) between simulated aerial images and target photomasks. The framework integrates differentiable modules for Fresnel diffraction, material absorption, optical point spread function blur, phase-shift effects, and contrast modulation with direct geometric pattern matching objectives, enabling cross-geometry generalization with minimal training data. Through physics-constrained learning on 15 representative patterns spanning current production to future research nodes, we demonstrate consistent sub-nanometer EPE performance (0.664-2.536 nm range) using only 50 training samples per pattern. Adaptive physics learning achieves an average improvement of 69.9\% over CNN baselines without physics constraints, with a significant inference speedup over rigorous electromagnetic solvers after training completion. This approach requires 90\% fewer training samples through cross-geometry generalization compared to pattern-specific CNN training approaches. This work establishes physics-constrained adaptive learning as a foundational methodology for real-time semiconductor manufacturing optimization, addressing the critical gap between academic physics-informed neural networks and industrial deployment requirements through joint physics calibration and manufacturing precision objectives.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Stability Analysis of ReLU Feedback Systems via Integral Quadratic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes internal stability of a discrete-time feedback system with a ReLU nonlinearity. This feedback system is motivated by recurrent neural networks. We first review existing static quadratic constraints (QCs) for slope-restricted nonlinearities. Next, we derive hard integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) for scalar ReLU by using finite impulse filters and structured matrices. These IQCs are combined with a dissipation inequality leading to an LMI condition that certifies internal stability. We show that our new dynamic IQCs for ReLU are a superset of the well-known Zames-Falb IQCs specified for slope-restricted nonlinearities. Numerical results show that the proposed hard IQCs give less conservative stability margins than Zames-Falb multipliers and prior static QC methods, sometimes dramatically so.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for Quantum State Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an indispensable tool for characterizing many-body quantum systems. However, due to the exponential scaling cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), a compressed sensing technique, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large systems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction infidelity by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation. Our work advances the state of low-rank QST and may be applicable to other quantum tomography protocols.</description>

      <title>Learning Branching Policies for MILPs with Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branch-and-Bound (B\&amp;B) is the dominant exact solution method for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP), yet its exponential time complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale instances. The growing capabilities of machine learning have spurred efforts to improve B\&amp;B by learning data-driven branching policies. However, most existing approaches rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which tends to overfit to expert demonstrations and struggles to generalize to structurally diverse or unseen instances. In this work, we propose Tree-Gate Proximal Policy Optimization (TGPPO), a novel framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, to train a branching policy aimed at improving generalization across heterogeneous MILP instances. Our approach builds on a parameterized state space representation that dynamically captures the evolving context of the search tree. Empirical evaluations show that TGPPO often outperforms existing learning-based policies in terms of reducing the number of nodes explored and improving p-Primal-Dual Integrals (PDI), particularly in out-of-distribution instances. These results highlight the potential of RL to develop robust and adaptable branching strategies for MILP solvers.</description>

      <title>An Online Multiobjective Policy Gradient for Long-run Average-reward Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for multi-objective decision-making, where the agent seeks to optimize a vector of rewards rather than a single scalar value. The objective is to ensure that the time-averaged reward vector converges asymptotically to a predefined target set. Since standard RL algorithms operate on scalar rewards, we introduce a dynamic scalarization mechanism guided by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence. We establish theoretical convergence of the long-run average reward vector to the target set and validate the approach through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Revealing POMDPs: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis for Parity Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High communication costs create a major bottleneck for distributed resource allocation over unbalanced directed networks. Conventional dual gradient tracking methods, while effective for problems on unbalanced digraphs, rely on periodic communication that creates significant overhead in resource-constrained networks. This paper introduces a novel event-triggered dual gradient tracking algorithm to mitigate this limitation, wherein agents communicate only when local state deviations surpass a predefined threshold. We establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for this approach. First, we prove sublinear convergence for non-convex dual objectives and linear convergence under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. Building on this, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear convergence for general strongly convex cost functions and linear convergence for those that are also Lipschitz-smooth. Numerical experiments confirm that our event-triggered method significantly reduces communication events compared to periodic schemes while preserving comparable convergence performance.</description>

      <title>On the controller form for linear hyperbolic MIMO systems with dynamic boundary conditions</title>

Abstract: This contribution develops an algebraic approach to obtain a controller form for a class of linear hyperbolic MIMO systems, bidirectionally coupled with a linear ODE system at the unactuated boundary. After a short summary of established controller forms for SISO and MIMO ODE as well as SISO hyperbolic PDE systems, it is shown that the direct ap- proach to state a controller form fails already for a very simple MIMO example. Next, a generalised hyperbolic controller form with different variants is proposed and a new flatnesss-based scheme to compute said form is presented. Therein, the system is treated in an algebraic setting where generalised polynomials with real exponents are used to describe the predictions and delays in the system. The proposed algorithm is then applied to the motivating example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exhausters and coexhausters are notions of constructive nonsmooth analysis which are used to study extremal properties of functions. An upper exhauster (coexhauster) is used to get an approximation of a considered function in the neighborhood of a point in the form of $\min\max$ of linear (affine) functions. A lower exhauster (coexhauster) is used to represent the approximation in the form of $\max\min$ of linear (affine) functions. Conditions for a minimum in a most simple way are expressed by means of upper exhausters and coexhausters, while conditions for a maximum are described in terms of lower exhausters and coexhausters. Thus the problem of obtaining an upper exhauster or coexhauster when the lower one is given and vice verse arises. We study this problem in the paper and propose new method for its solution which allows one to pass easily between $\min\max$ and $\max\min$ representations.</description>

      <title>Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As structural constraints on a control gain result in non-convexity in general, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions with the same sparsity pattern as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a nonlinear matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As its relaxation, we derive novel LMIs, one of which strictly covers the conventional relaxation, and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control. Lastly, numerical examples underscore the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective stochastic linear programming with recourse and flexible decision making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal inventory leads to stochastic optimization problems where deterministic delivery decisions have to be made in advance of stochastic demand realizations. Similarly, risk deposits have to be given before the random outcomes of investments are known. In this paper, multi-criteria versions of such stochastic recourse problems are studied. In addition to traditional concepts like Pareto-optimality, a decision maker for the multi-criteria problem may have a preference for greater flexibility in the second stage decision. This idea leads to a first stage optimization problem with a set-valued objective instead of a mere multi-criteria one. Under linearity assumptions, this problem becomes a polyhedral convex set optimization problem instead of a multi-objective linear program. Solution concepts for multi-objective/set-valued recourse problems are given as well as deterministic surrogates of the stochastic problem such as its deterministic equivalent, the so-called wait-and-see problem and the expected-value problem for the multi-objective case. Managerial decision making guidelines are obtained based on set optimization methods and the preference-for-flexibility approach: choose the deterministic first stage variable such that a maximum of flexibility is combined with a guarantee for Pareto minimal objective values. Two major examples illustrate the findings, a multi-objective newsvendor problem with an additional health/sustainability objective and a risk compensation problem where the availability of more than one asset for risk compensation, e.g., several currencies, leads to multiple objectives.</description>

      <title>Hedging Hydrogen: Planning and Contracting Under Uncertainty for a Green Hydrogen Producer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Green hydrogen production by water electrolysis using renewable electricity is considered essential for decarbonisation of certain sectors of the global economy, however development of the industry is lagging behind expectations due to the perceived financial risk for individual projects. This risk stems from a number of uncertainties, including future hydrogen demand, variable renewable energy sources, and volatile energy market prices. The interaction of these uncertainties is complex, yet the analysis of hydrogen projects is often carried out using simplified modelling that often omits uncertainty and/or energy hedging practices which are typical for intensive power consumers. In this study, we define a set of planning methods (planning policies) in order to compare the effectiveness of different modelling approaches. We propose a 2-stage market-focused stochastic program to represent a hydrogen producer supplying an industrial customer through a hydrogen offtake contract (a Hydrogen Purchase Agreement, or HPA). The model can be used to obtain equipment sizing decisions, as well as energy hedging decisions using Power Purchase Agreements (PPA's) and power futures. We find that for some HPA contract types, failure to use stochastic modelling can lead to planning decisions that result in 30% higher production costs during scenario stress-testing for the same project. This could lead to some projects being discarded by developers, incorrectly deemed to be unviable due to cost projections being too high. The results also show the importance of HPA contract volumetric obligations in limiting demand uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Distributed Generalized Nash Equilibria Learning for Online Stochastic Aggregative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates online stochastic aggregative games subject to local set constraints and time-varying coupled inequality constraints, where each player possesses a time-varying expectation-valued cost function relying on not only its own decision variable but also an aggregation of all the players' variables. Each player can only access its local individual cost function and constraints, necessitating partial information exchanges with neighboring players through time-varying unbalanced networks. Additionally, local cost functions and constraint functions are not prior knowledge and only revealed gradually. To learn generalized Nash equilibria of such games, a novel distributed online stochastic algorithm is devised based on push-sum and primal-dual strategies. Through rigorous analysis, high probability bounds on the regret and constraint violation are provided by appropriately selecting decreasing stepsizes. Moreover, for a time-invariant stochastic strongly monotone game, it is shown that the generated sequence by the designed algorithm converges to its variational generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) almost surely, and the time-averaged sequence converges sublinearly with high probability. Finally, the derived theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Assortment optimization given basket shopping behavior using the Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In markets where customers tend to purchase baskets of products rather than single products, assortment optimization is a major challenge for retailers. Removing a product from a retailer's assortment can result in a severe drop in aggregate demand if this product is a complement to other products. Therefore, accounting for the complementarity effect is essential when making assortment decisions. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework designed to address this problem. We model customers' choices using a Markov random field -- in particular, the Ising model -- which captures pairwise demand dependencies as well as the individual attractiveness of each product. Using the Ising model allows us to leverage existing methodologies for various purposes including parameter estimation and efficient simulation of customer choices. We formulate the assortment optimization problem under this model and show that it is APX-hard. We also provide multiple theoretical insights into the structure of the optimal assortments based on the graphical representation of the Ising model, and propose several heuristic algorithms that can be used to obtain high-quality solutions to the assortment optimization problem. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the developed simulated annealing procedure leads to an expected profit gain of 15% compared to offering an unoptimized assortment (where all products are included) and around 5% compared to using a revenue-ordered heuristic algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Coupling Constraints in Pessimistic Linear Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The literature on pessimistic bilevel optimization with coupling constraints is rather scarce and it has been common sense that these problems are harder to tackle than pessimistic bilevel problems without coupling constraints. In this note, we show that this is not the case. To this end, given a pessimistic problem with coupling constraints, we derive a pessimistic problem without coupling constraints that has the same set of globally optimal solutions. Moreover, our results also show that one can equivalently replace a pessimistic problem with such constraints with an optimistic problem without coupling constraints. This paves the way of both transferring theory and solution techniques from any type of these problems to any other one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm integrating global and robust optimization methods to solve continuous non-convex quadratic problems under convex uncertainty sets. The proposed Robust spatial branch-and-bound (RsBB) algorithm combines the principles of spatial branch-and-bound (sBB) with robust cutting planes. We apply the RsBB algorithm to quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems, utilizing McCormick envelopes to obtain convex lower bounds. The performance of the RsBB algorithm is compared with stateof-the-art methods that rely on global solvers. As computational test bed for our proposed approach we focus on pooling problems under different types and sizes of uncertainty sets. The findings of our work highlight the efficiency of the RsBB algorithm in terms of computational time and optimality convergence and provide insights to the advantages of combining robustness and optimality search.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily Small Execution-Time Certificate: What was Missed in Analog Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical optimization (solving optimization problems using digital computers) currently dominates but has three major drawbacks: high energy consumption, poor scalability, and lack of an execution time certificate. To address these challenges, this article explores the recent resurgence of analog computers, proposing a novel paradigm of arbitrarily small execution-time-certified analog optimization (solving optimization problems via analog computers). To achieve ultra-low energy consumption, this paradigm transforms optimization problems into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages the ability of analog computers to naturally solve ODEs (no need for time discretization) in physically real time. However, this transformation can fail if the optimization problem, such as the general convex nonlinear programs (NLPs) considered in this article, has no feasible solution. To avoid transformation failure and enable infeasibility detection, we introduce the homogeneous monotone complementarity problem formulation for convex NLPs. To achieve scalability and an execution time certificate, this paper introduces the Newton-based fixed-time-stable scheme for the transformed ODE, whose settling time $T_p$ can be prescribed by choosing the ODE's time coefficient as $k=\frac{\pi}{2T_p}$. This equation certifies that the settling time (execution time) is independent of the dimension of the optimization problems and can be arbitrarily small if the analog computer allows.</description>

      <title>Provably data-driven projection method for quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</description>

      <title>Assessing On-Demand Mobility Services and Policy Impacts: A Case Study from Chengdu, China</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of ride-hailing services has significantly reshaped urban on-demand mobility patterns, but it still remains unclear how they perform relative to traditional street-hailing services and how effective are related policy interventions. This study presents a simulation framework integrating a graph theory-based trip-vehicle matching mechanism with real cruising taxi operations data to simulate ride-hailing services in Chengdu, China. The performances of the two on-demand mobility service modes (i.e., ride-hailing and street-hailing) are evaluated in terms of three key performance indicators: average passenger waiting time (APWT), average deadheading miles (ADM), and average deadheading energy consumption (ADEC). We further examine the impacts of spatiotemporal characteristics and three types of policies: fleet size management, geofencing, and demand management, on the performance of ride-hailing services. Results show that under the same fleet size and trip demand as street-hailing taxis, ride-hailing services without cruising achieve substantial improvements, reducing APWT, ADM, and ADEC by 81\%, 75\%, and 72.1\%, respectively. These improvements are most pronounced during midnight low-demand hours and in remote areas such as airports. Our analysis also reveals that for ride-hailing service, (1) expanding fleet size yields diminishing marginal benefits; (2) geofencing worsens overall performance while it improves the performance of serving all trips within the city center; and (3) demand-side management targeting trips to high-attraction and low-demand areas can effectively reduce passenger waiting time without increasing deadheading costs.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of choosing prices of a set of products so as to maximize profit, taking into account self-elasticity and cross-elasticity, subject to constraints on the prices. We show that this problem can be formulated as maximizing the sum of a convex and concave function. We compare three methods for finding a locally optimal approximate solution. The first is based on the convex-concave procedure, and involves solving a short sequence of convex problems. Another one uses a custom minorize-maximize method, and involves solving a sequence of quadratic programs. The final method is to use a general purpose nonlinear programming method. In numerical examples all three converge reliably to the same local maximum, independent of the starting prices, leading us to believe that the prices found are likely globally optimal.</description>

      <title>Bridging Constraints and Stochasticity: A Fully First-Order Method for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Linear Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides the first finite-time convergence guarantees for linearly constrained stochastic bilevel optimization using only first-order methods, requiring solely gradient information without any Hessian computations or second-order derivatives. We address the unprecedented challenge of simultaneously handling linear constraints, stochastic noise, and finite-time analysis in bilevel optimization, a combination that has remained theoretically intractable until now. While existing approaches either require second-order information, handle only unconstrained stochastic problems, or provide merely asymptotic convergence results, our method achieves finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques alone. We develop a novel framework that constructs hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions, using approximate primal and dual solutions to overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the interaction between linear constraints and stochastic noise. Our theoretical analysis provides explicit finite-time bounds on the bias and variance of the hypergradient estimator, demonstrating how approximation errors interact with stochastic perturbations. We prove that our first-order algorithm converges to $(\delta, \epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary points using $\Theta(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-5})$ stochastic gradient evaluations, establishing the first finite-time complexity result for this challenging problem class and representing a significant theoretical breakthrough in constrained stochastic bilevel optimization.</description>

      <title>Continuity, Uniqueness and Long-Term Behavior of Nash Flows Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic model of traffic that has received a lot of attention in the past few years. Users control infinitesimal flow particles aiming to travel from an origin to a destination as quickly as possible. Flow patterns vary over time, and congestion effects are modeled via queues, which form whenever the inflow into a link exceeds its capacity. Despite lots of interest, some very basic questions remain open in this model. We resolve a number of them in the single-commodity setting:
  - We show uniqueness of journey times in equilibria.
  - We show continuity of equilibria: small perturbations to the instance or to the traffic situation at some moment cannot lead to wildly different equilibrium evolutions.
  - We demonstrate that, assuming constant inflow into the network at the source, equilibria always settle down into a "steady state" in which the behavior extends forever in a linear fashion.
  One of our main conceptual contributions is to show that the answer to the first two questions, on uniqueness and continuity, are intimately connected to the third. To resolve the third question, we substantially extend the approach of Cominetti et al., who show a steady-state result in the regime where the input flow rate is smaller than the network capacity.</description>

      <title>A Modular-Form Framework for Global Optimality in the Asymmetric Traveling-Salesman Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an alternate formulation of Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP). The equivalent problem is to find the zeros of a holomorphic cusp form on the principal congruence subgroup, $\Gamma(4) $. The resultant Poincar{\'e} series gives a cusp form whose interior zeros are in bijection with the arc that constitute optimal Hamiltonian cycle. We show that for any weight, $\ell$ and number of directed arcs, $|A|$ such that $4\ell-7&lt;2|A| $, the holomorphic cusp form vanishes at global optimum. Furthermore, a three step filter consisting of Fourier coefficients, Hecke recursions and completed $L$-function parity test provides a scalar certificate for global optimality. The framework is a potential bridge between discrete optimization and number theory suggesting an alternate view on complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Unimodular polytopes and column number bounds on polytopal totally unimodular matrices via Seymour's decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the number of distinct columns of a totally unimodular matrix with column sums $1$ improving upon Heller's classical bound. The proof uses Seymour's decomposition theorem. Such matrices are closely related to unimodular polytopes: lattice polytopes where the vertices of every full-dimensional subsimplex form an affine lattice basis. This is an interesting subclass of 0/1-polytopes and contains for instance edge polytopes of bipartite graphs. Our main result on totally unimodular matrices implies a sharp upper bound on the number of vertices of unimodular polytopes.</description>

      <title>Using Linearized Optimal Transport to Predict the Evolution of Stochastic Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an Euler-type method to predict the evolution of a time-dependent probability measure without explicitly learning an operator that governs its evolution. We use linearized optimal transport theory to prove that the measure-valued analog of Euler's method is first-order accurate when the measure evolves ``smoothly.'' In applications of interest, however, the measure is an empirical distribution of a system of stochastic particles whose behavior is only accessible through an agent-based micro-scale simulation. In such cases, this empirical measure does not evolve smoothly because the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales. However, we can still perform our Euler-type method, and when the particles' collective distribution approximates a measure that \emph{does} evolve smoothly, we observe that the algorithm still accurately predicts this collective behavior over relatively large Euler steps, thus reducing the number of micro-scale steps required to step forward in time. In this way, our algorithm provides a ``macro-scale timestepper'' that requires less micro-scale data to still maintain accuracy, which we demonstrate with three illustrative examples: a biological agent-based model, a model of a PDE, and a model of Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Method of Moments for Estimation of Noisy Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a ground truth high dimensional piecewise linear curve $C^*(t):[0, 1]\to\mathbb{R}^d$ from a high noise Gaussian point cloud with covariance $\sigma^2I$ centered around the curve. We establish that the sample complexity of recovering $C^*$ from data scales with order at least $\sigma^6$. We then show that recovery of a piecewise linear curve from the third moment is locally well-posed, and hence $O(\sigma^6)$ samples is also sufficient for recovery. We propose methods to recover a curve from data based on a fitting to the third moment tensor with a careful initialization strategy and conduct some numerical experiments verifying the ability of our methods to recover curves. All code for our numerical experiments is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>MeshCone: Second-Order Cone Programming for Geometrically-Constrained Mesh Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern geometric generation methods rely heavily on deep learning methods that, while powerful, often lack interpretability and require extensive training data. This work introduces MeshCone, a convex optimization framework for mesh enhancement from partially deformed meshes that requires no training data. We formulate the problem as a second-order cone program where vertex positions are optimized to align with target geometry while enforcing smoothness through convex edge-length regularization. Our convex relaxation enables deterministic, interpretable solutions with proven convergence properties via the Splitting Conic Solver (SCS). We demonstrate robust performance across 56 diverse object categories from ShapeNet and ThreeDScans, achieving superior refinement quality compared to classical baselines while maintaining sub-second inference times. This work establishes a principled baseline demonstrating what convex optimization alone can achieve, providing mathematical guarantees and interpretability that complement data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Invariant Kalman Filter for Relative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for invariant filtering of relative dynamics on Lie groups. We first revisit the notion of state trajectory independence, under which the estimation error evolves autonomously, and derive new equivalent conditions by decomposing the system vector field into left-invariant, intrinsic, and right-invariant components. Building on this result, we introduce the concept of relative trajectory independence to characterize when the relative motion between two dynamical systems is autonomous. A key theoretical finding is that relative trajectory independence automatically ensures state trajectory independence for the corresponding estimation error. This connection provides the foundation for constructing invariant filters that preserve the Lie group structure, maintain exact linearization of the error dynamics, and enable consistent covariance propagation. These are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Comparison for semi-continuous viscosity solutions for second order PDEs on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a comparison result for semi-continuous viscosity solutions of a class of second-order PDEs in the Wasserstein space. This allows us to remove the Lipschitz continuity assumption with respect to the Fourier-Wasserstein distance in AriX: 2309.05040 and obtain uniqueness by directly working in the Wasserstein space. In terms of its application, we characterize the value function of a stochastic control problem with partial observation as the unique viscosity solution to its corresponding HJB equation. Additionally, we present an application to a prediction problem under partial monitoring, where we establish an upper bound on the limit of regret using our comparison principle for degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to the case of Minkowski space, as we will show. Instead, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The first method is direct least squares optimization through a parametrization of $SO(3,1)_+$ in terms of the familiar boost and rotation vectors. The second method takes a detour through the Lorentz algebra; in addition to being conceptually simple and possessing a computational advantage over the first method, it can easily be generalized to the alignment of vector representations in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Parameter Identifiability of Linear-Compartmental Mammillary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear compartmental models are a widely used tool for analyzing systems arising in biology, medicine, and more. In such settings, it is essential to know whether model parameters can be recovered from experimental data. This is the identifiability problem. For a class of linear compartmental models with one input and one output, namely, those for which the underlying graph is a bidirected tree, Bortner et al. completely characterized which such models are structurally identifiability, which means that every parameter is generically locally identifiable. Here, we delve deeper, by examining which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable. Specifically, we analyze mammillary models, which consist of one central compartment which is connected to all other (peripheral) compartments. For these models, which fall into five infinite families, we determine which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable, and we give formulas for some of the globally identifiable parameters in terms of the coefficients of input-output equations. Our proofs rely on a combinatorial formula due to Bortner et al. for these coefficients.</description>

      <title>Fast Equivariant Imaging: Acceleration for Unsupervised Learning via Augmented Lagrangian and Auxiliary PnP Denoisers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose Fast Equivariant Imaging (FEI), a novel unsupervised learning framework to rapidly and efficiently train deep imaging networks without ground-truth data. From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior efficiency and performance compared to the vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In particular, our FEI schemes achieve an order-of-magnitude (10x) acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net for X-ray CT reconstruction and image inpainting, with improved generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Regret Matching in Potential Games and Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regret matching (RM) -- and its modern variants -- is a foundational online algorithm that has been at the heart of many AI breakthrough results in solving benchmark zero-sum games, such as poker. Yet, surprisingly little is known so far in theory about its convergence beyond two-player zero-sum games. For example, whether regret matching converges to Nash equilibria in potential games has been an open problem for two decades. Even beyond games, one could try to use RM variants for general constrained optimization problems. Recent empirical evidence suggests that they -- particularly regret matching$^+$ (RM$^+$) -- attain strong performance on benchmark constrained optimization problems, outperforming traditional gradient descent-type algorithms.
  We show that RM$^+$ converges to an $\epsilon$-KKT point after $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations, establishing for the first time that it is a sound and fast first-order optimizer. Our argument relates the KKT gap to the accumulated regret, two quantities that are entirely disparate in general but interact in an intriguing way in our setting, so much so that when regrets are bounded, our complexity bound improves all the way to $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^2)$. From a technical standpoint, while RM$^+$ does not have the usual one-step improvement property in general, we show that it does in a certain region that the algorithm will quickly reach and remain in thereafter. In sharp contrast, our second main result establishes a lower bound: RM, with or without alternation, can take an exponential number of iterations to reach a crude approximate solution even in two-player potential games. This represents the first worst-case separation between RM and RM$^+$. Our lower bound shows that convergence to coarse correlated equilibria in potential games is exponentially faster than convergence to Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Hybrid second-order gradient histogram based global low-rank sparse regression for robust face recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank sparse regression models have been widely adopted in face recognition due to their robustness against occlusion and illumination variations. However, existing methods often suffer from insufficient feature representation and limited modeling of structured corruption across samples. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hybrid second-order gradient Histogram based Global Low-Rank Sparse Regression (H2H-GLRSR) model. First, we propose the Histogram of Oriented Hessian (HOH) to capture second-order geometric characteristics such as curvature and ridge patterns. By fusing HOH and first-order gradient histograms, we construct a unified local descriptor, termed the Hybrid second-order gradient Histogram (H2H), which enhances structural discriminability under challenging conditions. Subsequently, the H2H features are incorporated into an extended version of the Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR\_NMR) model, where a global low-rank constraint is imposed on the residual matrix to exploit cross-sample correlations in structured noise. The resulting H2H-GLRSR model achieves superior discrimination and robustness. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art regression-based classifiers in both recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>New perturbation bounds for low rank approximation of matrices via contour analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $\sigma_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading to the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. In this paper, we develop a novel method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements, compared to classical approaches in the literature (using Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem or Davis-Kahan theorem), in many settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications.</description>
