      <title>Novel ground states and emergent quantum many-body scars in a two-species Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array has been established as one appealing platform for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Recent experimental development of trapping and controlling two-species atoms using optical tweezer arrays has brought more complex interactions in this game, enabling much versatile novel quantum states and phenomena to emerge and thus leading to a growing need for both theoretical and numerical investigations in this regard. In this paper we systematically calculate the ground state phase diagram of alternating two-species atom array and find some novel quantum states that cannot exist in traditional cold-atom platforms, for instance the period $4$ product state $|1100\rangle^{\otimes m}$, the period $6$ product state $|111000\rangle^{\otimes m}$ and order-disorder separation phase. We also confirm the existence of floating phase, however, in this system it has to be described by two interacting bosonic fields whereas that in the single species Rydberg atom array can be understood as free bosons. More interestingly, in the quench dynamics we discover a type of new quantum many-body scar distinct from that previous found in single species atoms which is explained by low-energy effective theory of the PXP model. Instead, the underlying physics of the newly found quantum many-body scar can be described by a perturbation theory spanning the whole energy spectrum. Detailed analysis on how to experimentally prepare these states and observe the phenomena is provided. Numerical evidence shows that the proposed scheme is robust against typical experimentally relevent imperfections and thus it is implementable. Our work opens new avenue for quantum simulating novel quantum many-body states both in and out of equilibrium arising from the interplay of competing interactions of different atom species and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for number-conserving bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer models and certain Levin-Wen string-net models, and we also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Energy conservation and quantum backreaction in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates are suitable systems for studying fundamental aspects of quantum backreaction. Here the backreaction problem in 1D condensates is considered from the perspective of energy and momentum conservation. By assuming the validity of Bogoliubov theory, the backreaction equations are used to identify the contributions to the system energy and momentum coming from quantum fluctuations and condensate corrections. The backreaction is solved for a condensate trapped in a ring configuration and such that particle interactions are continuously switched on. It is shown that the energy in the condensate cannot be addressed without taking into account how the system entered the interacting regime, and even for homogeneous condensates the power transferred to the condensate by quantum fluctuations showcases an intricate non-monotonic pattern.</description>

      <title>Quantized Thouless pumps protected by interactions in dimerized Rydberg tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Thouless pumps, i.e., adiabatic topological transport, in an interacting spin chain described by the dimerized XXZ Hamiltonian. In the noninteracting case, quantized Thouless pumps can only occur when a topological singularity is encircled adiabatically. In contrast, here we show that, in the presence of interactions, such topological transport can even persist for exotic paths in which the system gets arbitrarily close to the noninteracting singularity. We illustrate the robustness of these exotic Thouless pumps through the behavior of the noninteracting singularity, which for sufficiently strong interactions splits into two singularities separated by a spontaneous antiferromagnetic insulator. We perform a numerical benchmark of these phenomena by means of tensor network simulations of ground-state physics and real-time adiabatic dynamics. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol with Floquet-driven Rydberg tweezer arrays.</description>
