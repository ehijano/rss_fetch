      <title>Radiative Decay of the $^{229m}$Th Nuclear Clock Isomer in Different Host Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy study conducted at ISOLDE-CERN of the radiative decay of the $^{229m}$Th nuclear clock isomer embedded in different host materials is reported. The ratio of the number of radiative decay photons and the number of $^{229m}$Th embedded are determined for single crystalline CaF$_2$, MgF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, AlN, and amorphous SiO$_2$. For the latter two materials, no radiative decay signal was observed and an upper limit of the ratio is reported. The radiative decay wavelength was determined in LiSrAlF$_6$ and CaF$_2$, reducing its uncertainty by a factor of 2.5 relative to our previous measurement. This value is in agreement with the recently reported improved values from laser excitation.</description>

      <title>Preservation of the Direct Photon and Neutral Meson Analysis in the PHENIX Experiment at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PHENIX Collaboration has actively pursued a Data and Analysis Preservation program since 2019, the first such dedicated effort at RHIC. A particularly challenging aspect of this endeavor is preservation of complex physics analyses, selected for their scientific importance and the value of the specific techniques developed as a part of the research. For this, we have chosen one of the most impactful PHENIX results, the joint study of direct photons and neutral pions in high-energy d+Au collisions. To ensure reproducibility of this analysis going forward, we partitioned it into self-contained tasks and used a combination of containerization techniques, code management, and robust documentation. We then leveraged REANA (the platform for reproducible analysis developed at CERN) to run the required software. We present our experience based on this example, and outline our future plans for analysis preservation.</description>

      <title>Observation of near-scission "polar" and "equatorial" proton emission in heavy-ion induced fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton and $\alpha$-particle energy spectra were measured in coincidence with fission fragments at different relative angles in $^{16}$O (96 MeV) + $^{232}$Th reaction. The multiplicity spectra were analyzed within the framework of a Moving Source Disentangling Analysis (MSDA) to determine contributions from different emission stages. The MSDA conclusively shows ``Near Scission Emission (NSE)" as an essential component in the multiplicity spectra. In contrast to NSE $\alpha$ particles which emit mainly perpendicular (``equatorial emission"), the NSE protons are observed to be emitted perpendicular as well as parallel (``polar emission") to the fission axis with similar intensities ($\sim$20\% for each). Thus, around 40\% of total pre-scission protons are emitted near the scission stage, whereas the same fraction for $\alpha$ particles is only around 10\%. The inevitable presence of ``polar" and ``equatorial" NSE protons in a heavy-ion induced fission has been observed for the first time. Present results open up a new avenue to study the heavy-ion induced fission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quark and Gluon Helicity Evolution at Small $x$: Revised and Updated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of small Bjorken-$x$ evolution of the gluon and flavor-singlet quark helicity distributions in the shock wave ($s$-channel) formalism. Earlier works on the subject in the same framework resulted in an evolution equation for the gluon field-strength $F^{12}$ and quark "axial current" ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$ operators (sandwiched between the appropriate light-cone Wilson lines) in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA: summing powers of $\alpha_s\,\ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant). In this work, we observe that an important mixing of the above operators with another gluon operator, $\overleftarrow{D}^i\,{D}^i$, also sandwiched between the light-cone Wilson lines (with the repeated index $i=1,2$ summed over), was missing in the previous works. This operator has the physical meaning of the sub-eikonal (covariant) phase: its contribution to helicity evolution is shown to be proportional to another sub-eikonal operator, $D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, which is related to the Jaffe-Manohar polarized gluon distribution. In this work we include this operator into small-$x$ helicity evolution, and construct a novel evolution mixing all three operators ($D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, $F^{12}$, and ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$), generalizing the previous results. We also construct closed DLA evolution equations in the large-$N_c$ and large-$N_c\&amp; N_f$ limits, with $N_c$ and $N_f$ the numbers of quark colors and flavors, respectively. Solving the large-$N_c$ equations numerically we obtain the following small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark and gluon helicity distributions $\Delta \Sigma$ and $\Delta G$, along with the $g_1$ structure function, \[\Delta\Sigma(x,Q^2)\sim\Delta G(x,Q^2)\sim g_1(x,Q^2)\sim\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{3.66\,\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s\,N_c}{2\pi}}},\] in complete agreement with the earlier work by Bartels, Ermolaev and Ryskin.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Boosted Decision Tree Analysis for the Majorana Demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10710v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Majorana Demonstrator is a leading experiment searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay with high purity germanium detectors (HPGe). Machine learning provides a new way to maximize the amount of information provided by these detectors, but the data-driven nature makes it less interpretable compared to traditional analysis. An interpretability study reveals the machine's decision-making logic, allowing us to learn from the machine to feedback to the traditional analysis. In this work, we have presented the first machine learning analysis of the data from the Majorana Demonstrator; this is also the first interpretable machine learning analysis of any germanium detector experiment. Two gradient boosted decision tree models are trained to learn from the data, and a game-theory-based model interpretability study is conducted to understand the origin of the classification power. By learning from data, this analysis recognizes the correlations among reconstruction parameters to further enhance the background rejection performance. By learning from the machine, this analysis reveals the importance of new background categories to reciprocally benefit the standard Majorana analysis. This model is highly compatible with next-generation germanium detector experiments like LEGEND since it can be simultaneously trained on a large number of detectors.</description>

      <title>Pulse shape discrimination based on the Tempotron: a powerful classifier on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study utilized the Tempotron, a robust classifier based on a third-generation neural network model, for pulse shape discrimination. By eliminating the need for manual feature extraction, the Tempotron model can process pulse signals directly, generating discrimination results based on prior knowledge. The study performed experiments using GPU acceleration, resulting in over 500 times faster compared to the CPU-based model, and investigated the impact of noise augmentation on the Tempotron performance. Experimental results substantiated that Tempotron serves as a formidable classifier, adept at accomplishing high discrimination accuracy on both AmBe and time-of-flight PuBe datasets. Furthermore, analyzing the neural activity of Tempotron during training shed light on its learning characteristics and aided in selecting its hyperparameters. Moreover, the study addressed the constraints and potential avenues for future development in utilizing the Tempotron for pulse shape discrimination. The dataset used in this study and the GPU-based Tempotron are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/TempotronGPU.</description>

      <title>$\tau$SPECT: A spin-flip loaded magnetic ultracold neutron trap for a determination of the neutron lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The confinement of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) in a three dimensional magnetic field gradient trap allows for a measurement of the free neutron lifetime with superior control over spurious loss channels and can provide a large kinetic energy acceptance to enhance statistical sensitivity. In this paper, we present the first successful implementation of a pulsed spin-flip based loading scheme for a three-dimensional magnetic UCN trap. The measurements with the $\tau$SPECT experiment were performed at the pulsed UCN source of the research reactor TRIGA Mainz. We report on detailed investigations of major systematic effects influencing the neutron storage time, statistically limited by the size of the recorded data set. The extracted neutron storage time constant of $\tau = 859(16)\mathrm{s}$ is compatible with, but not to be interpreted as, a measurement of the free neutron lifetime.</description>
