      <title>Length dependence of waveform mismatch: a caveat on waveform accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration's code SpEC can now routinely simulate binary black hole mergers undergoing $\sim25$ orbits, with the longest simulations undergoing nearly $\sim180$ orbits. While this sounds impressive, the mismatch between the highest resolutions for this long simulation is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. Meanwhile, the mismatch between resolutions for the more typical simulations tends to be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, despite the resolutions being similar to the long simulations'. In this note, we explain why mismatch alone gives an incomplete picture of code -- and waveform -- quality, especially in the context of providing waveform templates for LISA and 3G detectors, which require templates with $\mathcal{O}(10^{3}) - \mathcal{O}(10^{5})$ orbits. We argue that to ready the GW community for the sensitivity of future detectors, numerical relativity groups must be aware of this caveat, and also run future simulations with at least three resolutions to properly assess waveform accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lensing and wave optics in the strong field of a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

      <title>On Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes and Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent papers on spacetimes with a signature-changing metric, the concept of a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole and new elements for Lorentzian-Riemannian signature change have been introduced. A Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole is a signature-changing modification of the Schwarzschild spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations in a weak sense. Here the event horizon serves as a boundary beyond which time becomes imaginary. We demonstrate that the proper time needed to reach the horizon remains finite, consistently with the classical Schwarzschild solution. About Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions, we stress that the hypersurface where the metric signature changes is naturally a spacelike hypersurface which might be identified with the future or past causal boundary of the Lorentzian sector. Moreover, a number of geometric interpretations appear, as the degeneracy of the metric corresponds to the collapse of the causal cones into a line, the degeneracy of the dual metric corresponds to collapsing into a hyperplane, and additional geometric structures on the transition hypersurface (Galilean and dual Galilean) might be explored.</description>

      <title>Non-topological soliton Bardeen boson stars and its frozen state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Bardeen model coupling Einstein gravity with nonlinear electromagnetic fields and non-topological soliton complex scalar fields, governed by the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$, the complex scalar field frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and the self-interaction parameter $\tilde{\eta}$. Our results reveal that the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$ exhibits $\tilde{\eta}$-dependent critical values $\tilde{q}_c$, beyond which ($\tilde{q} &gt; \tilde{q}_c$) Bardeen boson stars (BBSs) may transition into frozen states ($\tilde{\omega} \to 0$). These frozen states are characterized by a critical horizon whose radius $\tilde r^\mathrm{H}_{c}$ satisfies $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}} &lt; \tilde r_{c} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{H,RN}}$, where $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}}$ and $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{RN}}$ denote the inner and outer horizons of magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black holes with equivalent mass and magnetic charge. Notably, the ADM mass of frozen BBSs is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Furthermore, light ring (LR) solutions exist universally across all tested combinations of $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{\eta}$, with all frozen BBSs exhibiting LRs whose outer radius $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}}$ is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Compared to magnetic RN black holes, frozen BBSs possess a smaller outer LR radius ($\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR, RN}}$).</description>

      <title>Dragging of inertial frames in the composed Kerr-Newman-orbiting-ring system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting object implies that the horizon angular velocity $\Omega^{\text{BH-ring}}_{\text{H}}$ of a central black hole in a composed black-hole-orbiting-ring system is no longer related to its angular-momentum $J_{\text{H}}$ by the familiar vacuum functional relation $\Omega_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}})=J_{\text{H}}/M\alpha$ (here $\{M,\alpha\}$ are respectively the mass and normalized area of the central spinning black hole). Using a continuity argument, it has recently been revealed that the composed Kerr-ring system is characterized by the universal (that is, spin-{\it independent}) relation $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}\equiv\Omega^{\text{BH-ring}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}},J_{\text{R}},R\to R^{+}_{\text{H}})-\Omega^{\text{Kerr}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}})={{J_{\text{R}}}/{4M^3}}$, where $\{R,J_{\text{R}}\}$ are respectively the radius of the ring and its orbital angular momentum and $R_{\text{H}}$ is the horizon radius of the central Kerr black hole. This intriguing observation naturally raises the following physically interesting question: Does the physical quantity $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}$ in a composed black-hole-orbiting-ring system is always characterized by the near-horizon functional relation $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}={{J_{\text{R}}}/{4M^3}}$ which is independent of the spin (angular momentum) $J_{\text{H}}$ of the central black hole? In the present compact paper we explore the physical phenomenon of dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting ring in the composed Kerr-Newman-black-hole-orbiting-ring system. In particular, using analytical techniques, we reveal the fact that in this composed two-body (black-hole-ring) system the quantity $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}$ has an explicit non-trivial functional dependence on the angular momentum $J_{\text{H}}$ of the central spinning black hole.</description>

      <title>Modeling coupled constellation dynamics for TianQin under self-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TianQin is a dedicated geocentric mission for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection. Among its core technologies, the drag-free and pointing control subsystem (DFPCS) - consisting of suspension, drag-free and pointing controls - keeps the two test masses (TMs) centered and aligned within their housings while maintaining drag-free conditions and precise telescope pointing along the laser-arm directions. This results in orbit-attitude coupled dynamics for the constellation. The coupling is made more prominent due to satellite self-gravity, which requires compensation from DFPCS and generally makes the satellites deviate from pure free-fall orbits. Previous studies assumed that the orbit and attitude dynamics could be decoupled in numerical simulation, neglecting the back-action from the closed-loop control to orbit propagation. To address this, we develop a comprehensive model that can propagate the full 9-body (6 TMs + 3 satellites, orbits and attitudes) dynamics inter-dependently under the inter-satellite pointing and drag-free conditions. This paper is threefold. First, we reassess the applicability of the two TMs and telescope pointing scheme to TianQin using the new model, and confirm the previous conclusion. Second, to meet the constellation stability requirements, it is found that the DC common self-gravity in the flight direction should be minimized, or kept close for the three satellites. Finally, we simulate the long-range light path between two TMs/satellites with a precision of sub-pm/Hz$^{1/2}$, and the results support the decoupling of the closed-loop dynamics and high-precision orbit for computational efficiency. The method is instrumental to other future missions where the orbit-attitude coupling needs careful consideration.</description>

      <title>The massive BMS character in 3D quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic symmetries, such as the BMS group for asymptotically flat spacetimes, provide a natural framework for describing particles in quantum gravity where spacetimes highly fluctuate. Similar techniques have also been applied to systems with boundaries at finite distances. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional quantum gravity on a finite-radius twisted thermal flat background with a conical defect, representing a test point particle. By computing the one-loop partition function in both discrete and continuum geometry settings, we recover the massive BMS$_3$ character. The additional modes, compared to the vacuum case, arise from broken diffeomorphism symmetry due to the conical defect.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a "graviphoton") emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a fundamental violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</description>

      <title>Purely metric Horndeski theories and spontaneous curvaturization of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore purely metric theories of gravity with second-order equations of motion and a single additional, purely gravitational, propagating, scalar degree of freedom. We identify a subclass of these theories in which this scalar causes a phenomenon similar to black-hole scalarization, which we call curvaturization: around small enough Kerr black holes, the scalar induces a tachyonic instability. This triggers a sudden growth of Ricci curvature and results in a new branch of vacuum black-hole solutions. We study the properties of these black holes both in the static as well as the spinning case.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis for the Pontryagin action and boundary terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the Pontryagin model adopting different geometric-covariant approaches. In particular, we focus on the manner in which boundary conditions must be imposed on the background manifold in order to reproduce an unambiguous theory on the boundary. At a Lagrangian level, we describe the symmetries of the theory and construct the Lagrangian covariant momentum map which allows for an extension of Noether's theorems. Through the multisymplectic analysis we obtain the covariant momentum map associated with the action of the gauge group on the covariant multimomenta phase-space. By performing a space plus time decomposition by means of a foliation of the appropriate bundles, we are able to recover not only the $t$-instantaneous Lagrangian and Hamiltonian of the theory, but also the generator of the gauge transformations. In the polysymplectic framework we perform a Poisson-Hamilton analysis with the help of the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian and the Poisson-Gerstenhaber bracket. Remarkably, as long as we consider a background manifold with boundary, in all of these geometric formulations, we are able to recover the so-called differentiability conditions as a straightforward consequence of Noether's theorem.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy evolution during gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the ground state entanglement entropy for a discretized scalar field propagating within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse metric. Starting from a well-controlled initial configuration, we follow the system as it evolves toward the formation of a horizon and, eventually, a singularity. Our approach employs an Ermakov-like equation to determine the time-dependent ground state of the field and calculates the resulting entanglement entropy by tracing out the degrees of freedom inside a spherical region within the matter sphere. We find that the entanglement entropy exhibits nontrivial scaling and time dependence during collapse. Close to the horizon, the entropy can deviate from the simple area law, reflecting the rapid changes in geometry and field configuration. Although the model is idealized, these results provide insights into the generation and scaling of entanglement in the presence of realistic, dynamically evolving gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>PETRA: From the global fit for LISA's Galactic binaries to a catalog of sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect mHz gravitational waves from many astrophysical sources, including millions of compact binaries in the Galaxy, thousands of which may be individually resolvable. The large number of signals overlapping in the LISA dataset requires a global fit in which an unknown number of sources are modeled simultaneously. This introduces a label-switching ambiguity for sources in the same class, making it challenging to distill a traditional astronomical catalog from global-fit posteriors. We present a method to construct a catalog by optimally relabeling samples from the global-fit posterior to minimize the statistical divergence between the global fit and a factorized catalog representation. The resulting catalog consists of the source posterior distributions and their probabilities of having an astrophysical origin. We demonstrate our algorithm on two toy models and on a small simulated LISA dataset of Galactic binaries. Our method is implemented in the open-source Python package petra_catalogs, and it can be applied in postprocessing to the output of any global-fit sampler.</description>

      <title>Digit quantum simulation of a fermion field in an expanding universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with non-equilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time-evolution problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity path integral of the trumpet can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an older black hole to a younger one, accompanied by the emission of a baby universe, represented by the geodesic boundary of the trumpet. However, this interpretation becomes less straightforward for geometries with higher genus and multiple geodesic boundaries. In this paper, we examine the path integral for these more complex geometries and find that maintaining this interpretation requires accounting for a portion of the moduli space.</description>

Abstract: We construct the twisted covariant form hierarchies (TCFH) of (massive) type IIA supergravity for common sector, D-brane and warped product AdS supersymmetric backgrounds and show that the Killing spinor bilinears satisfy a generalisation of the conformal Killing-Yano equation with respect to the TCFH connections. The Killing-St\"ackel, Killing-Yano and closed conformal Killing-Yano tensors of all spherically symmetric (massive) type IIA brane backgrounds are computed and one demonstrates that the geodesic flow on these solutions is completely integrable by giving all independent charges in involution. The Killing spinor form bilinears that generate hidden symmetries for spinning particle and string probe actions on such backgrounds are identified. The interplay between TCFHs and hidden symmetries of probes propagating on these backgrounds is investigated and used to explore the question of whether charges constructed from these bilinears are sufficient to prove the integrability of such probes on this class of backgrounds. Additionally, some of the properties of TCFHs, such as the reduced holonomy of the minimal TCFH connections for generic backgrounds, are investigated. After this, the algebra of holonomy symmetries of sigma models propagating on supersymmetric heterotic backgrounds with a non-compact holonomy group is determined. One demonstrates that these close as a W-algebra that is specified by a Lie algebra structure on the space of covariantly constant forms that generate the holonomy symmetries. In addition, the chiral anomalies associated with these symmetries are identified. Finally, it is argued that these anomalies are consistent and can be cancelled up to two loops in the sigma model perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. This is done with a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free-fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-to-dS and dS-to-dS transitions: Implications for the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential that induces a smooth shift in the effective cosmological constant (CC), encompassing transitions such as AdS-dS, 0-dS, and dS-dS, with the mirror AdS-dS as a particular case aligned with the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. In our construction, a phantom scalar field with a negative kinetic term drives a bottom-up transition from an AdS-like vacuum at high redshifts to a dS-like vacuum at low redshifts, thereby providing a physical underpinning for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. Our numerical integration of the equations of motion shows that the model is consistent with both CMB data and the SH0ES determination of $H_0$, thereby addressing the $H_0$ tension, with all key kinematical parameters-$H(z)$, $\dot{H}(z)$, and $q(z)$-evolving smoothly. The total energy density of the phantom and matter system remains positive at all times, and the effective EoS stays above -1, ensuring that the WEC is satisfied. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. We perform analysis of the transition period, demonstrating that the evolution of the DE density from a negative CC-like regime to a positive one does not exactly mirror the behavior of the potential-e.g., it lasts longer-as it also involves the kinetic term. We also show that analogous quintessence models featuring dS-dS transitions predict an $H_0$ value lower than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby failing to address the $H_0$ tension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Primordial full bispectra from the general bounce cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities are key quantities to test early universe scenarios. In this paper, we compute full bispectra of scalar and tensor perturbations generated during a contracting phase in a general bounce model. The general bounce model consists of two branches: one realizes scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes become constant on superhorizon scales, as in de Sitter inflation, while the other realizes scale-invariant power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes grow on superhorizon scales, as in matter bounce cosmology. We study the auto- and cross-bispectra originating from the scale-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations in these two branches. We investigate the amplitudes and shapes of non-Gaussianities and find that the differences between the two branches manifest for equilateral and squeezed momentum triangle configurations. In particular, one of the branches in which the superhorizon perturbations are conserved reproduces the so-called Maldacena's consistency relation. By examining perturbativity conditions and considering current observational constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities, we also find a viable parameter space in which both theoretical and observational constraints are satisfied simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Fast Generation of Weak Lensing Maps in Modified Gravity with COLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of weak lensing observables are essential for understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and probing the nature of gravity. In this work, we present a lightcone implementation to generate maps of the weak lensing convergence field using the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method. The lightcone is constructed in spherical shells from the source to the observer following an onion representation of the Universe.
  We validate the COLA-generated convergence maps in General Relativity by comparing five statistics to those of maps obtained with the high-resolution $N$-body simulations presented in Takahashi $et\ al.$ (2017): the power spectrum, bispectrum, probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals. The convergence power spectrum is accurate to within $5\%$ up to $\ell\sim500$ and to within $10\%$ up to $\ell\sim750$, confirming the accuracy of this method on both linear and non-linear scales. For the probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals, we determine the map pixel resolution required for COLA to capture the statistical features of the $N$-body convergence maps.
  Our validation tests provide a baseline for the convergence map specifications at which we can trust COLA for each statistic considered. Using these map specifications, we extend our analyses to two representative theories of Modified Gravity, and demonstrate their imprints on the five convergence statistics considered. This work represents a step towards precise weak lensing predictions under both General Relativity and Modified Gravity with reduced computational cost, providing a robust framework to explore the nature of gravity using field-level inference.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity: Emergence of Gravity in an Infinitely Divisible Quantum Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02813v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $SU(\infty)-QGR$ is a foundationally quantum approach to cosmology and gravity. It assumes that the Hilbert space of the Universe as a whole represents the symmetry group $SU(\infty)$, and demonstrates this symmetry for Hilbert spaces of infinite number of subsystems, which randomly emerge and represent arbitrary finite rank {\it internal} symmetries. The aim of present work is in depth study of the foundation and properties of this model. We show that the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement of each subsystem with the rest of the Universe. We demonstrate that the states of subsystems depend on a dimensionful parameter arising due to the breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A relative dynamics arises when an arbitrary subsystem is selected as a quantum clock with a time parameter. Thus, states of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters related to their $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and dynamics, plus discrete parameters characterizing their internal symmetries. We demonstrate the irrelevance of the geometry of this parameter space for observables. On the other hand, we use quantum speed limits to show that the perceived classical spacetime and its Lorentzian geometry emerge as an average path of subsystems in their Hilbert space. In this respect, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ fundamentally deviates from gauge-gravity duality models. Invariance under reparameterization restricts the action of subsystems dynamics to a Yang-Mills quantum field theory defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries. Consequently, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ is renormalizable, but predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Nonetheless, it is proved that when quantum gravity effects are not detectable, the dynamics is perceived as the Einstein-Hilbert action. We briefly discuss $SU(\infty)-QGR$ specific models for dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report provides Green's functions (classical propagators) of gravitational fields appearing in general relativity. The existence of Green's function of the wave equation in curved space with an indefinite metric is ensured owing to the Hodge harmonic analysis. The analyticity of Green's function is determined intrinsically to keep a causality. This report proposed a novel definition of momentum space in curved space-time and the linearisation of the Einstein equation as a free field consistent with that of the Yang-Mills gauge field. The proposed linearisation does not utilize the weak-field approximation; thus, the method applies to highly caved space-time. We gave two examples of Green's function of gravitational fields: the plane wave solution and the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Bianchi I spacetimes within the Jordan frame of Brans-Dicke theory, incorporating the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. After developing general formulas, we analyze the robustness of classical singularity resolution due to quantum geometric effects using two common quantization schemes. We then compare the resulting physical properties. We find that both schemes replace classical singularities with regular quantum bounces. Notably, in contrast to similar studies based on general relativity, we find that all three directional scale factors of the Bianchi I spacetimes increase and after the quantum bounce they reach values similar to their initial values, leading to a merging with classical spacetimes in both schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new family of vacuum axially symmetric static solutions to Einstein's field equations. This solution is a geometrically modified version of the Yilmaz exponential metric (YEM) which has recently been shown to represent a traversable wormhole. This vacuum solution is a one-parameter static singular solution with its singularity located at $r=0$. Furthermore, it is shown that both the YEM and its geometrically modified version, introduced in this work i.e., the Axially Symmetric Exponential metric (ASEM) belong to a general 2-parameter class of solutions supported by an anisotropic fluid. Depending on the parameters the generic energy-momentum tensor represents either an exotic or a normal fluid. Concerning the ASEM, the circular stable orbit doesn't exist for a null particle, however, for a massive particle such orbit exists provided its radius is larger than a minimum radius. This is in analogy with the Schwarzschild black hole as well as the YEM.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new set of BMS charges at null infinity, characterized by a super-translation flux that contains only the `hard' term. This is achieved with a specific corner improvement of the symplectic 2-form, and we spell the conditions under which it is unique. The charges are associated to a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential, and satisfy all standard criteria: they are covariant, provide a center-less realization of the symmetry algebra, have vanishing flux in non-radiative spacetimes, and vanish in Minkowski. We use them to define a notion of spatially localized energy density of gravitational waves, and explain how it can be measured doing experiments which are purely local in space and over an extended period of time.</description>

Abstract: We derive areal inequalities for five types of attractive gravity probe surfaces, which were proposed by us in order to characterize the strength of gravity in different ways including weak gravity region, taking into account of contributions of electric and magnetic charges, angular momentum, gravitational waves, and matters. These inequalities are generalizations of the Riemannian Penrose inequality for minimal surfaces, and lead to the concept of extremality for a given surface whose condition is given in terms of the gravitational mass and the electromagnetic charges. This means that the extremality is a characteristic property not only of black hole horizons or minimal surfaces but also of surfaces in weak gravity region. We also derive areal inequalities and extremality conditions for surfaces in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>History of a Particle Bounded to the Cosmological LTB Black Hole Surrounded by the Quintom Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derived the complete set of time-dependent geodesic equations for an LTB black hole surrounded by a Quintom field and investigated the evolution of effective potential and photon orbits across cosmic epochs. Our findings demonstrate that in an accelerated universe, the peak of an effective potential decreases in height and shifts toward smaller radii. Additionally, the probability of stable orbit formation decreases as cosmic expansion progresses. We classified the possible trajectories into four types: terminating bound orbits, stable orbits, scattering flyby orbits, and terminating escape orbits. The results indicate that stable bound orbits are more prevalent in the early universe, whereas at late time epochs, flyby orbits become dominant due to the expansion-driven weakening of gravitational potential. We further analyzed the impact of angular momentum on the evolution of orbits, showing that as it increases, the ISCO radius decreases while the peak of the effective potential shifts outward. This suggests that particles with higher angular momentum follow extended bound orbits, and more energetic photons are more likely to be captured by the black hole. Conversely, an increase in angular momentum reduces the probability of flyby orbits while increasing the likelihood of direct fall into the black hole. Our study provides new insights into how cosmic acceleration influences black hole geodesics, revealing that the progressive shrinking of ISCO and stable orbits eventually disappear as the universe approaches the Big Rip singularity. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamical nature of cosmological black holes and may offer new perspectives for observational tests through gravitational lensing, accretion disk evolution, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in evolving black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Equivalence in virtual transitions between uniformly accelerated and static atoms: from a bird's eye</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the prospect of the equivalence principle at the quantum regime by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector in different scenarios. In particular, two specific set-ups are considered. ($i$) $Without~a~boundary$: In one scenario the atom is in uniform acceleration and interacting with Minkowski field modes. While in the other the atom is static and in interaction with Rindler field modes. ($ii$) $With~a~reflecting~boundary$: In one scenario, the atom is uniformly accelerated, and the mirror is static, and in the other scenario, the atom is static, and the mirror is in uniform acceleration. In these cases, the atom interacts with the field modes, defined in the mirror's frame. For both the set-ups, the focus is on the excitation and de-excitation probabilities in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$ spacetime dimensions. Our observations affirm that in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for both set-ups the transition probabilities from different scenarios become the same when the atomic and the field frequencies are equal. In contrast, in $(3+1)$ dimensions this equivalence is not observed in general, inspiring us to look for a deeper physical interpretation. Our findings suggest that when the equivalence between different scenarios is concerned, the excitation to de-excitation ratio provides a more consistent measure even in $(3+1)$ dimensions. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution to Standard Model Hydrodynamic Cosmological Perturbation Theory and its Implications for Acoustic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11735v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact solution to standard model cosmological perturbation theory in a matter-dominated, adiabatic, hydrodynamic era. The solution is in the form of hypergeometric functions. While such functions can oscillate with the sound velocity, they can only do so at high frequency. There is thus a maximum wavelength to these oscillations, with this maximum wavelength serving to provide a horizon for acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Low-curvature quantum corrections from unitary evolution of de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of de Sitter space formulated as a minisuperspace model with flat spatial hypersurfaces in unimodular gravity, both in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Time evolution is defined naturally in unimodular time, which appears as conjugate to the cosmological (integration) constant. We show that requiring unitary time evolution "resolves" the de Sitter horizon where the flat slicing breaks down and leads to strong quantum effects there, even though locally nothing special happens at this surface. For a cosmological constant that is far below the Planck scale, loop quantum gravity corrections do not alter the main results in any substantial way. This model illustrates the fundamental clash between general covariance and unitarity in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array third data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inflation model with nonminimal derivative coupling that features a coupling between the derivative of the inflaton field and the Einstein tensor. This model naturally amplifies curvature perturbations at small scales via gravitationally enhanced friction, a mechanism critical for the formation of primordial black holes and the associated production of potentially detectable scalar-induced gravitational waves. We derive analytical expressions for the primordial power spectrum, enabling efficient exploration of the model parameter space without requiring computationally intensive numerical solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA DR3), we constrain the model parameters characterizing the coupling function: $\phi_c = 3.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5} M_\mathrm{P}$, $\log_{10} \omega_L = 7.1^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$, and $\log_{10} \sigma = -8.3^{+0.3}_{-0.6}$ at 90\% confidence level. Our results demonstrate the growing capability of pulsar timing arrays to probe early Universe physics, complementing traditional cosmic microwave background observations by providing unique constraints on inflationary dynamics at small scales.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive Boson Stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields. The equation of state of massive boson stars and their masses, radii, modeled by a self-interacting scalar field with potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2|\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda |\phi|^4$ are known to follow scaling relations. The non-radial fundamental oscillations of such massive BSs have been studied only for a few select model parameters so far. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the $f$-mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit ($\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2$). This opens up the outstanding prospect of studying the $f$-modes of massive BSs throughout the scalar DM parameter space. We study the implications of this finding by carrying out a detailed study of massive BS $f$-modes in a separate work. Here, having introduced this scaling, we use it to compare boson star oscillations with the neutron star and black hole quasinormal modes, thus providing a smoking gun for the distinguishability of BSs using gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>

      <title>The footprint of nuclear saturation properties on the neutron star $f$ mode oscillation frequencies: a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intricate relationships between the non-radial \(f\) mode oscillation frequencies of neutron stars (NS)s and the corresponding nuclear matter equation of state (EOS) using a machine learning (ML) approach within the ambit of the relativistic mean field (RMF) framework for nuclear matter. With two distinct parameterizations of the Walecka model, namely, (1) with non-linear self interactions of the scalar field (NL) and, (2) a density dependent Bayesian model (DDB), we perform a thorough examination of the \(f\) mode frequency in relation to various nuclear saturation properties. The correlations between the \(f\) mode frequencies and nuclear saturation properties reveal, through various analytical and ML methods, the complex nature of NSs and their potential as the cosmic laboratory for studying extreme states of matter. A principal component analysis (PCA) has been performed using mixed datasets from DDB and NL models to discriminate the relative importance of the different components of the EOS on the $f$ mode frequencies. Additionally, a {\it Random forest feature importance} analysis also elucidates the distinct roles of these properties in determining the \(f\) mode frequency across a spectrum of NS masses. Our findings are further supported by symbolic regression searches, yielding high-accuracy relations with strong Pearson coefficients and minimal errors. These relations suggest new methodologies for probing NS core characteristics, such as energy density, pressure, and speed of sound from observations of non-radial \(f\) mode oscillations of NSs.</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations of self-consistent, rotating neutron stars with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and its effects on their quasi-equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate that resistivity can significantly influence the development of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the simulations, for the models we investigated.</description>

      <title>Constant roll and non-Gaussian tail in light of logarithmic duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curvature perturbation in a model of constant-roll (CR) inflation is interpreted in view of the logarithmic duality discovered in Ref. [1] according to the $\delta N$ formalism. We confirm that the critical value $\beta:=\ddot{\varphi}/(H\dot{\varphi})=-3/2$ determining whether the CR condition is stable or not is understood as the point at which the dual solutions, i.e., the attractor and non-attractor solutions of the field equation, are interchanged. For the attractor-solution domination, the curvature perturbation in the CR model is given by a simple logarithmic mapping of a Gaussian random field, which can realise both the exponential tail (i.e., the single exponential decay) and the Gumbel-distribution-like tail (i.e., the double exponential decay) of the probability density function, depending on the value of $\beta$. Such a tail behaviour is important for, e.g., the estimation of the primordial black hole abundance.</description>

      <title>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Ward identities of a Carrollian CFT stress tensor at null infinity reproduce the leading and subleading soft graviton theorems for massless scattering in the bulk. We deduce the expressions of the stress tensor components in terms of the bulk radiative modes, and these components turn out to be local at $\mathscr{I}$ in terms of the twistor potentials. This analysis makes the correspondence between the large-time limit of Carrollian amplitudes and the soft limit of momentum space amplitudes manifest. We then construct Carrollian CFT currents from the ascendants of the hard graviton operator, which satisfy the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We show that the large-time limit of their Ward identities implies an infinite tower of projected soft graviton theorems in the bulk, while their finite-time OPEs encode the collinear limit of scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Anupam, Chowdhury, and Sen [arXiv:2308.00038] constructed the non-extremal saddle that reproduces the supersymmetric index of the BMPV black hole with three independent charges in the classical limit. This saddle solution is a finite temperature complex solution saturating the BPS bound. In this paper, we write this solution in a canonical form in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, thereby showing that it is supersymmetric. We also show that it exhibits the new form of attraction.</description>

      <title>A new look at multi-gravity and dimensional deconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been understood that certain theories of ghost free massive gravity and their multi-graviton extensions can be thought of as arising from a higher dimensional theory of gravity, upon discretising the extra dimension. However, this correspondence between standard multi-gravity and extra dimensional gravity holds only when one discretises the extra dimension after gauge fixing the lapse function associated to the various lower dimensional hypersurfaces. The lapse provides crucial structure to the extra dimensional theory: in pure general relativity (GR), it ensures full diffeomorphism invariance of the theory, and enforces its Hamiltonian constraint. Thus, upon deconstruction, important information related to the extra dimension is missing in the resulting multi-gravity theory; as a result one could never hope to recover higher dimensional GR in its entirety upon taking the appropriate continuum limit. Here, we develop an improved deconstruction procedure that maintains the free lapse, and show that the resulting deconstructed theory is essentially multi-gravity equipped with additional dynamical scalar fields, whose field equations encode the Hamiltonian constraint in the extra dimensional theory. As an example, we explicitly demonstrate that - with an FLRW ansatz for the metrics in this new theory - one may recover all of the equations and constraints of 5-dimensional brane cosmology upon taking the continuum limit. We then treat the deconstructed theory as an entity in its own right, and generalise it to arbitrary dimension and interaction structures beyond those admitting a well-defined continuum limit. We dub this theory `scalar-tensor multi-gravity', and show that the new scalar equations change the structure of some simple solutions that were previously allowed in standard multi-gravity, in a manner that exactly mirrors what we expect from higher dimensional GR.</description>
