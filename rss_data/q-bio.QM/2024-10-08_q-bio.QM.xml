      <title>Framing global structural identifiability in terms of parameter symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key initial step in mechanistic modelling of dynamical systems using first-order ordinary differential equations is to conduct a global structural identifiability analysis. This entails deducing which parameter combinations can be estimated from certain observed outputs. The standard differential algebra approach answers this question by re-writing the model as a system of ordinary differential equations solely depending on the observed outputs. Over the last decades, alternative approaches for analysing global structural identifiability based on so-called full symmetries, which are Lie symmetries acting on independent and dependent variables as well as parameters, have been proposed. However, the link between the standard differential algebra approach and that using full symmetries remains elusive. In this work, we establish this link by introducing the notion of parameter symmetries, which are a special type of full symmetry that alter parameters while preserving the observed outputs. Our main result states that a parameter combination is structurally identifiable if and only if it is a differential invariant of all parameter symmetries of a given model. We show that the standard differential algebra approach is consistent with the concept of considering structural identifiability in terms of parameter symmetries. We present an alternative symmetry-based approach, referred to as the CaLinInv-recipe, for analysing structural identifiability using parameter symmetries. Lastly, we demonstrate our approach on a glucose-insulin model and an epidemiological model of tuberculosis.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Reaction Field Energy Modeling via Deep Learning based Voxel-to-voxel Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational biochemistry and biophysics, understanding the role of electrostatic interactions is crucial for elucidating the structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules. The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation is a foundational tool for modeling these interactions by describing the electrostatic potential in and around charged molecules. However, solving the PB equation presents significant computational challenges due to the complexity of biomolecular surfaces and the need to account for mobile ions. While traditional numerical methods for solving the PB equation are accurate, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly with increasing system size. To address these challenges, we introduce PBNeF, a novel machine learning approach inspired by recent advancements in neural network-based partial differential equation solvers. Our method formulates the input and boundary electrostatic conditions of the PB equation into a learnable voxel representation, enabling the use of a neural field transformer to predict the PB solution and, subsequently, the reaction field potential energy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PBNeF achieves over a 100-fold speedup compared to traditional PB solvers, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the Generalized Born (GB) model.</description>

      <title>UFLUX v2.0: A Process-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Efficient and Explainable Modelling of Terrestrial Carbon Uptake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), the amount of carbon plants fixed by photosynthesis, is pivotal for understanding the global carbon cycle and ecosystem functioning. Process-based models built on the knowledge of ecological processes are susceptible to biases stemming from their assumptions and approximations. These limitations potentially result in considerable uncertainties in global GPP estimation, which may pose significant challenges to our Net Zero goals. This study presents UFLUX v2.0, a process-informed model that integrates state-of-art ecological knowledge and advanced machine learning techniques to reduce uncertainties in GPP estimation by learning the biases between process-based models and eddy covariance (EC) measurements. In our findings, UFLUX v2.0 demonstrated a substantial improvement in model accuracy, achieving an R^2 of 0.79 with a reduced RMSE of 1.60 g C m^-2 d^-1, compared to the process-based model's R^2 of 0.51 and RMSE of 3.09 g C m^-2 d^-1. Our global GPP distribution analysis indicates that while UFLUX v2.0 and the process-based model achieved similar global total GPP (137.47 Pg C and 132.23 Pg C, respectively), they exhibited large differences in spatial distribution, particularly in latitudinal gradients. These differences are very likely due to systematic biases in the process-based model and differing sensitivities to climate and environmental conditions. This study offers improved adaptability for GPP modelling across diverse ecosystems, and further enhances our understanding of global carbon cycles and its responses to environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sparse Generalized Singular Vectors for Feature Selection in Proximal Support Vector Machines with Application to Breast and Ovarian Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents approaches to compute sparse solutions of Generalized Singular Value Problem (GSVP). The GSVP is regularized by $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_q$-penalty for $0&lt;q&lt;1$, resulting in the $\ell_1$-GSVP and $\ell_q$-GSVP formulations. The solutions of these problems are determined by applying the proximal gradient descent algorithm with a fixed step size. The inherent sparsity levels within the computed solutions are exploited for feature selection, and subsequently, binary classification with non-parallel Support Vector Machines (SVM). For our feature selection task, SVM is integrated into the $\ell_1$-GSVP and $\ell_q$-GSVP frameworks to derive the $\ell_1$-GSVPSVM and $\ell_q$-GSVPSVM variants. Machine learning applications to cancer detection are considered. We remarkably report near-to-perfect balanced accuracy across breast and ovarian cancer datasets using a few selected features.</description>

      <title>Modelling and calibration of pair-rule protein patterns in Drosophila embryo: From Even-skipped and Fushi-tarazu to Wingless expression networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modelled and calibrated the distributions of the seven-stripe patterns of Even-skipped (\textit{Eve}) and Fushi-tarazu (\textit{Ftz}) pair-rule proteins along the anteroposterior axis of the \textit{Drosphila} embryo, established during early development. We have identified the putative repressive combinations for five \textit{Eve} enhancers, and we have explored the relationship between \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} for complementary patterns. The regulators of \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} are stripe-specific DNA enhancers with embryo position-dependent activation rates and are regulated by the gap family of proteins. We achieved remarkable data matching of the \textit{Eve} stripe pattern, and the calibrated model reproduces gap gene mutation experiments. Extended work inferring the Wingless (\textit{Wg}) fourteen stripe pattern from \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} enhancers have been proposed, clarifying the hierarchical structure of \textit{Drosphila}'s genetic expression network during early development.</description>

      <title>Symbolic-numeric algorithm for parameter estimation in discrete-time models with $\exp$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic models describe phenomena across scientific disciplines, yet to make these models useful in application the unknown parameter values of the models must be determined. Discrete-time dynamic models are widely used to model biological processes, but it is often difficult to determine these parameters. In this paper, we propose a symbolic-numeric approach for parameter estimation in discrete-time models that involve univariate non-algebraic (locally) analytic functions such as exp. We illustrate the performance (precision) of our approach by applying our approach to two archetypal discrete-time models in biology (the flour beetle 'LPA' model and discrete Lotka-Volterra competition model). Unlike optimization-based methods, our algorithm guarantees to find all solutions of the parameter values up to a specified precision given time-series data for the measured variables provided that there are finitely many parameter values that fit the data and that the used polynomial system solver can find all roots of the associated polynomial system with interval coefficients.</description>

      <title>Graph Residual based Method for Molecular Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning-driven methods for property prediction have been of deep interest. However, much work remains to be done to improve the generalization ability, accuracy, and inference time for critical applications. The traditional machine learning models predict properties based on the features extracted from the molecules, which are often not easily available. In this work, a novel Deep Learning method, the Edge Conditioned Residual Graph Neural Network (ECRGNN), has been applied, allowing us to predict properties directly only the Graph-based structures of the molecules. SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation of the molecules has been used in the present study as input data format, which has been further converted into a graph database, which constitutes the training data. This manuscript highlights a detailed description of the novel GRU-based methodology, ECRGNN, to map the inputs that have been used. Emphasis is placed on highlighting both the regressive property and the classification efficacy of the same. A detailed description of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and the end-to-end learning method used for multi-class multi-label property prediction has been provided as well. The results have been compared with standard benchmark datasets as well as some newly developed datasets. All performance metrics that have been used have been clearly defined, and their reason for choice.</description>

      <title>ProteinBench: A Holistic Evaluation of Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.</description>

      <title>A mobile digital device proficiency performance test for cognitive clinical research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile device proficiency is increasingly important for everyday living, including to deliver healthcare services. Human-device interactions represent a potential in cognitive neurology and aging research. Although traditional pen-and-paper evaluations serve as valuable tools within public health strategies for population-scale cognitive assessments, digital devices could amplify cognitive assessment. However, even person-centered studies often fail to incorporate measures of mobile device proficiency and research with digital mobile technology frequently neglects these evaluations. Besides that, cognitive screening, a fundamental part of brain health evaluation and a widely accepted strategy to identify high-risk individuals vulnerable to cognitive impairment and dementia, has research using digital devices for older adults in need for standardization. To address this shortfall, the DigiTAU collaborative and interdisciplinary project is creating refined methodological parameters for the investigation of digital biomarkers. With careful consideration of cognitive design elements, here we describe the open-source and performance-based Mobile Device Abilities Test (MDAT), a simple, low-cost, and reproductible open-sourced test framework. This result was achieved with a cross-sectional study population sample of 101 low and middle-income subjects aged 20 to 79 years old. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess the measurement of the construct. It was possible to achieve a reliable method with internal consistency, good content validity related to digital competences, and that does not have much interference with auto-perceived global functional disability, health self-perception, and motor dexterity. Limitations for this method are discussed and paths to improve and establish better standards are highlighted.</description>

      <title>FARM: Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into the representations. This strategic reduction in tokenization granularity is intentionally aligned with key drivers of functional properties (i.e., functional groups), enhancing the model's understanding of chemical language. By expanding the chemical lexicon, FARM more effectively bridges SMILES and natural language, ultimately advancing the model's capacity to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and by employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. By leveraging contrastive learning, FARM aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning, with promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.</description>
