      <title>Fast and Numerically Stable Implementation of Rate Constant Matrix Contraction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate constant matrix contraction (RCMC) method, proposed by Sumiya et al. (2015, 2017), enables fast and numerically stable simulations of chemical kinetics on large-scale reaction path networks. Later, Iwata et al. (2023) mathematically reformulated the RCMC method as a numerical algorithm to solve master equations whose coefficient matrices, known as rate constant matrices, possess the detailed balance property.
  This paper aims to accelerate the RCMC method. The bottleneck in the RCMC method lies in the greedy selection of steady states, which is actually equivalent to the greedy algorithm for the MAP inference in DPPs under cardinality constraints. Hemmi et al. (2022) introduced a fast implementation of the greedy DPP MAP inference, called LazyFastGreedy, by combining the greedy algorithm of Chen et al. (2018) with the lazy greedy algorithm by Minoux (1978), a practically efficient greedy algorithm that exploits the submodularity of the objective function. However, for instances arising from chemical kinetics, the straightforward application of LazyFastGreedy suffers from catastrophic cancellations due to the wide range of reaction time scales.
  To address this numerical instability, we propose a modification to LazyFastGreedy that avoids the subtraction of like-sign numbers by leveraging the properties of rate constant matrices and the connection of the DPP MAP inference to Cholesky decomposition. For faster implementation, we utilize a segment tree, a data structure that manages one-dimensional arrays of elements in a semigroup. We also analyze the increase in relative errors caused by like-sign subtractions and permit such subtractions when they do not lead to catastrophic cancellations, aiming to further accelerate the process. Using real instances, we confirm that the proposed algorithm is both numerically stable and significantly faster than the original RCMC method.</description>

      <title>Mixed finite element and TPSA finite volume methods for linearized elasticity and Cosserat materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosserat theory of elasticity is a generalization of classical elasticity that allows for asymmetry in the stress tensor by taking into account micropolar rotations in the medium. The equations involve a rotation field and associated "couple stress" as variables, in addition to the conventional displacement and Cauchy stress fields.
  In recent work, we derived a mixed finite element method (MFEM) for the linear Cosserat equations that converges optimally in these four variables. The drawback of this method is that it retains the stresses as unknowns, and therefore leads to relatively large saddle point system that are computationally demanding to solve.
  As an alternative, we developed a finite volume method in which the stress variables are approximated using a minimal, two-point stencil (TPSA). The system consists of the displacement and rotation variables, with an additional "solid pressure" unknown.
  Both the MFEM and TPSA methods are robust in the incompressible limit and in the Cauchy limit, for which the Cosserat equations degenerate to classical linearized elasticity. We report on the construction of the methods, their a priori properties, and compare their numerical performance against an MPSA finite volume method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current automatic differentiation frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX cannot differentiate the full QR factorisation for tall matrices. We provide expressions for calculating the derivative of the compact WY representation and use them to obtain expressions for the derivative of the full QR factorisation when the $Q$ factor can be expressed using the compact WY representation.</description>

      <title>A high-order implicit time integration method for linear and nonlinear dynamics with efficient computation of accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm for a family of self-starting high-order implicit time integration schemes with controllable numerical dissipation is proposed for both linear and nonlinear transient problems. This work builds on the previous works of the authors on elastodynamics by presenting a new algorithm that eliminates the need for factorization of the mass matrix providing benefit for the solution of nonlinear problems. The improved algorithm directly obtains the acceleration at the same order of accuracy of the displacement and velocity using vector operations (without additional equation solutions). The nonlinearity is handled by numerical integration within a time step to achieve the desired order of accuracy. The new algorithm fully retains the desirable features of the previous works: 1. The order of accuracy is not affected by the presence of external forces and physical damping; 2. numerical dissipation in the algorithm is controlled by a user-specified parameter, leading to schemes ranging from perfectly nondissipative A-stable to L-stable; 3. The effective stiffness matrix is a linear combination of the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices as in the trapezoidal rule. The proposed algorithm is shown to replicate the numerical results demonstrated on linear problems in previous works. Additional numerical examples of linear and nonlinear vibration and wave propagation are presented herein. Notably, the proposed algorithms show the same convergence rates for nonlinear problems as linear problems, and very high accuracy. Second-order time integration methods commonly used in commercial software produce significantly polluted acceleration responses for a common class of wave propagation problems. The high-order time integration schemes presented here perform noticably better at suppressing spurious high-frequency oscillations and producing reliable and useable acceleration responses.</description>

      <title>An adaptive space-time method for nonlinear poroviscoelastic flows with discontinuous porosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a space-time adaptive numerical method for instationary porous media flows with nonlinear interaction between porosity and pressure, with focus on problems with discontinuous initial porosities. A convergent method that yields computable error bounds is constructed by a combination of Picard iteration and a least-squares formulation. The adaptive scheme permits spatially variable time steps, which in numerical tests are shown to lead to efficient approximations of solutions with localized porosity waves. The method is also observed to exhibit optimal convergence with respect to the total number of spatio-temporal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Dense cell-by-cell systems of PDEs: approximation, spectral analysis, and preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider the Extra-Membrane-Intra model (EMI) for the simulation of excitable tissues at the cellular level. We provide the (possibly large) system of partial differential equations (PDEs), equipped with ad hoc boundary conditions, relevant to model portions of excitable tissues, composed of several cells. In particular, we study two geometrical settings: computational cardiology and neuroscience.
  The Galerkin approximations to the considered system of PDEs lead to large linear systems of algebraic equations, where the coefficient matrices depend on the number $N$ of cells and the fineness parameters. We give a structural and spectral analysis of the related matrix-sequences with $N$ fixed and with fineness parameters tending to zero. Based on the theoretical results, we propose preconditioners and specific multilevel solvers.
  Numerical experiments are presented and critically discussed, showing that a monolithic multilevel solver is efficient and robust with respect to all the problem and discretization parameters. In particular, we include numerical results increasing the number of cells $N$, both for idealized geometries (with $N$ exceeding $10^5$) and for realistic, densely populated 3D tissue reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Data Compression using Rank-1 Lattices for Parameter Estimation in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean squared error and regularized versions of it are standard loss functions in supervised machine learning. However, calculating these losses for large data sets can be computationally demanding. Modifying an approach of J. Dick and M. Feischl [Journal of Complexity 67 (2021)], we present algorithms to reduce extensive data sets to a smaller size using rank-1 lattices. Rank-1 lattices are quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) point sets that are, if carefully chosen, well-distributed in a multidimensional unit cube. The compression strategy in the preprocessing step assigns every lattice point a pair of weights depending on the original data and responses, representing its relative importance. As a result, the compressed data makes iterative loss calculations in optimization steps much faster. We analyze the errors of our QMC data compression algorithms and the cost of the preprocessing step for functions whose Fourier coefficients decay sufficiently fast so that they lie in certain Wiener algebras or Korobov spaces. In particular, we prove that our approach can lead to arbitrary high convergence rates as long as the functions are sufficiently smooth.</description>

      <title>A Preconditioned Version of a Nested Primal-Dual Algorithm for Image Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational models for image deblurring problems typically consist of a smooth term and a potentially non-smooth convex term. A common approach to solving these problems is using proximal gradient methods. To accelerate the convergence of these first-order iterative algorithms, strategies such as variable metric methods have been introduced in the literature.
  In this paper, we prove that, for image deblurring problems, the variable metric strategy can be reinterpreted as a right preconditioning method. Consequently, we explore an inexact left-preconditioned version of the same proximal gradient method. We prove the convergence of the new iteration to the minimum of a variational model where the norm of the data fidelity term depends on the preconditioner. The numerical results show that left and right preconditioning are comparable in terms of the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed tolerance, but left preconditioning needs much less CPU time, as it involves fewer evaluations of the preconditioner matrix compared to right preconditioning. The quality of the computed solutions with left and right preconditioning are comparable.
  Finally, we propose some non-stationary sequences of preconditioners that allow for fast and stable convergence to the solution of the variational problem with the classical $\ell^2$--norm on the fidelity term.</description>

      <title>Invertible ResNets for Inverse Imaging Problems: Competitive Performance with Provable Regularization Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving inverse problems, particularly in image reconstruction tasks. Despite their success, these approaches often lack theoretical guarantees, which are crucial in sensitive applications such as medical imaging. Recent works by Arndt et al (2023 Inverse Problems 39 125018, 2024 Inverse Problems 40 045021) addressed this gap by analyzing a data-driven reconstruction method based on invertible residual networks (iResNets). They revealed that, under reasonable assumptions, this approach constitutes a convergent regularization scheme. However, the performance of the reconstruction method was only validated on academic toy problems and small-scale iResNet architectures. In this work, we address this gap by evaluating the performance of iResNets on two real-world imaging tasks: a linear blurring operator and a nonlinear diffusion operator. To do so, we extend some of the theoretical results from Arndt et al to encompass nonlinear inverse problems and offer insights for the design of large-scale performant iResNet architectures. Through numerical experiments, we compare the performance of our iResNet models against state-of-the-art neural networks, confirming their efficacy. Additionally, we numerically investigate the theoretical guarantees of this approach and demonstrate how the invertibility of the network enables a deeper analysis of the learned forward operator and its learned regularization.</description>

      <title>Analysis of any order Runge-Kutta Spectral Volume Schemes for 1D Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze any-order Runge-Kutta spectral volume schemes (RKSV(s,k)) for solving the one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic equation. The RKSV(s,k) was constructed by using the $s$-th explicit Runge-Kutta method in time-discretization which has {\it strong-stability-preserving} (SSP) property, and by letting a piecewise $k-$th degree($k\geq 1 $ is an arbitrary integer) polynomial satisfy the local conservation law in each control volume designed by subdividing the underlying mesh with $k$ Gauss-Legendre points (LSV) or right-Radau points (RRSV).For the RKSV(s,k), we would like to establish a general framework which use the matrix transferring process technique for analyzing the stability and the convergence property. The framework for stability is evolved based on the energy equation, while the framework for error estimate is evolved based on the error equation. And the evolution process is represented by matrices.After the evolution is completed, three key indicative pieces of information are obtained: the termination factor $\zeta$, the indicator factor $\rho$, and the final evolved matrix. We prove that for the RKSV(s,k), the {\it stability } holds and the $L_2$ norm error estimate is $\mathcal{O}(h^{k+1}+\tau^s)$, provided that the CFL condition is satisfied. Our theoretical findings have been justified by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Some new techniques to use in serial sparse Cholesky factorization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new variant of serial right-looking supernodal sparse Cholesky factorization (RL). Our comparison of RL with the multifrontal method confirms that RL is simpler, slightly faster, and requires slightly less storage. The key to the rest of the work in this paper is recent work on reordering columns within supernodes so that the dense off-diagonal blocks in the factor matrix joining pairs of supernodes are fewer and larger. We present a second new variant of serial right-looking supernodal sparse Cholesky factorization (RLB), where this one is specifically designed to exploit fewer and larger off-diagonal blocks in the factor matrix obtained by reordering within supernodes. A key distinction found in RLB is that it uses no floating-point working storage and performs no assembly operations. Our key finding is that RLB is unequivocally faster than its competitors. Indeed, RLB is consistently, but modestly, faster than its competitors whenever Intel's MKL sequential BLAS are used. More importantly, RLB is substantially faster than its competitors whenever Intel's MKL multithreaded BLAS are used. Finally, RLB using the multithreaded BLAS achieves impressive speedups over RLB using the sequential BLAS.</description>

      <title>Limits of non-local approximations to the Eikonal equation on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a non-local approximation of the time-dependent Eikonal equation defined on a Riemannian manifold. We show that the local and the non-local problems are well-posed in the sense of viscosity solutions and we prove regularity properties of these solutions in time and space. If the kernel is properly scaled, we then derive error bounds between the solution to the non-local problem and the one to the local problem, both in continuous-time and Forward Euler discretization. Finally, we apply these results to a sequence of random weighted graphs with n vertices. In particular, we establish that the solution to the problem on graphs converges almost surely uniformly to the viscosity solution of the local problem as the kernel scale parameter decreases at an appropriate rate when the number of vertices grows and the time step vanishes.</description>

      <title>An accelerated preconditioned proximal gradient algorithm with a generalized Nesterov momentum for PET image reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an Accelerated Preconditioned Proximal Gradient Algorithm (APPGA) for effectively solving a class of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) image reconstruction models with differentiable regularizers. We establish the convergence of APPGA with the Generalized Nesterov (GN) momentum scheme, demonstrating its ability to converge to a minimizer of the objective function with rates of $o(1/k^{2\omega})$ and $o(1/k^{\omega})$ in terms of the function value and the distance between consecutive iterates, respectively, where $\omega\in(0,1]$ is the power parameter of the GN momentum. To achieve an efficient algorithm with high-order convergence rate for the higher-order isotropic total variation (ITV) regularized PET image reconstruction model, we replace the ITV term by its smoothed version and subsequently apply APPGA to solve the smoothed model. Numerical results presented in this work indicate that as $\omega\in(0,1]$ increase, APPGA converges at a progressively faster rate. Furthermore, APPGA exhibits superior performance compared to the preconditioned proximal gradient algorithm and the preconditioned Krasnoselskii-Mann algorithm. The extension of the GN momentum technique for solving a more complex optimization model with multiple nondifferentiable terms is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Krasnoselskii-Mann Proximity Algorithm for Markowitz Portfolios with Adaptive Expected Return Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markowitz's criterion aims to balance expected return and risk when optimizing the portfolio. The expected return level is usually fixed according to the risk appetite of an investor, then the risk is minimized at this fixed return level. However, the investor may not know which return level is suitable for her/him and the current financial circumstance. It motivates us to find a novel approach that adaptively optimizes this return level and the portfolio at the same time. It not only relieves the trouble of deciding the return level during an investment but also gets more adaptive to the ever-changing financial market than a subjective return level. In order to solve the new model, we propose an exact, convergent, and efficient Krasnoselskii-Mann Proximity Algorithm based on the proximity operator and Krasnoselskii-Mann momentum technique. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in portfolio optimization. This finding may contribute a new perspective on the relationship between return and risk in portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Variational and thermodynamically consistent finite element discretization for heat conducting viscous fluids</title>

Abstract: Respecting the laws of thermodynamics is crucial for ensuring that numerical simulations of dynamical systems deliver physically relevant results. In this paper, we construct a structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent finite element method and time-stepping scheme for heat conducting viscous fluids, with general state equations. The method is deduced by discretizing a variational formulation for nonequilibrium thermodynamics that extends Hamilton's principle for fluids to systems with irreversible processes. The resulting scheme preserves the balance of energy and mass to machine precision, as well as the second law of thermodynamics, both at the spatially and temporally discrete levels. The method is shown to apply both with insulated and prescribed heat flux boundary conditions, as well as with prescribed temperature boundary conditions. We illustrate the properties of the scheme with the Rayleigh-B\'enard thermal convection. While the focus is on heat conducting viscous fluids, the proposed discrete variational framework paves the way to a systematic construction of thermodynamically consistent discretizations of continuum systems.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimality Conditions for Structured Linear Time-invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpolatory necessary optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of unstructured linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are well-known. Based on previous work on $\mathcal{L}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of stationary parametric problems, in this paper we develop and investigate optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of structured LTI systems, in particular, for second-order, port-Hamiltonian, and time-delay systems. Under certain diagonalizability assumptions, we show that across all these different structured settings, bitangential Hermite interpolation is the common form for optimality, thus proving a unifying optimality framework for structured reduced-order modeling.</description>

      <title>A variationally consistent membrane wrinkling model based on spectral decomposition of the strain tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel variationally consistent membrane wrinkling model for analyzing the mechanical responses of wrinkled thin membranes. The elastic strain energy density is split into tensile and compressive terms via a spectral decomposition of the strain tensor. Tensile and compressive parts of the stress and constitutive tensors are then obtained via consistent variation from the respective strain energies. Considering only the positive part of the strain energy in the variational formulation, we obtain a membrane with zero compressive stiffness. By adding the negative strain energy multiplied with a very small factor, we further obtain a residual compressive stiffness, which improves stability and allows handling also states of slackening. Comparison with results from analytical, numerical and experimental examples from the literature on membrane wrinkling problems demonstrate the great performance and capability of the proposed approach, which is also compatible with commercial finite element software.</description>

      <title>A Locking-free modified conforming FEM for planar elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the divergence-instability, the accuracy of low-order conforming finite element methods (FEMs) for nearly incompressible elasticity equations deteriorates as the Lam\'e parameter $\lambda\to\infty$, or equivalently as the Poisson ratio $\nu\to1/2$. This effect is known as \itshape{locking} or \itshape{non-robustness}. For the piecewise linear case, the error in the ${\bf L}^2$-norm of the standard Galerkin conforming FEM is bounded by $C\lambda h^2$, resulting in poor accuracy for practical values of $h$ if $\lambda$ is sufficiently large. In this paper, we show that for 2D problems the locking phenomenon can be controlled by replacing $\lambda$ with $\lambda_h=\lambda/(1+\lambda h/L)$ in the stiffness matrix, where $L$ is the diameter of the body $\Omega$. We prove that with this modification, the error in the ${\bf L}^2$-norm is bounded by $Ch$ for a constant $C$ that does not depend on $\lambda$. Numerical experiments confirm this convergence behaviour and show that, for practical meshes, our method is more accurate than the standard method if the material is nearly incompressible. Our analysis also shows that the error in the ${\bf H}^1$-norm is bounded by $Ch^{1/2}$, but our numerical experiments suggest that this bound is not sharp.</description>

      <title>Surface elevation errors in finite element Stokes models for glacier evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary data which determine the evolution of glaciation are the bedrock elevation and the surface mass balance. From this data, which we assume is defined over a fixed land region, the glacier's geometry solves a free boundary problem which balances the time derivative of the surface elevation, the surface velocity from the Stokes flow, and the surface mass balance. A surface elevation function for this problem is admissible if it is above the bedrock topography, equivalently if the ice thickness is nonnegative. This free boundary problem can be posed in weak form as a variational inequality. After some preparatory theory for the glaciological Stokes problem, we conjecture that the continuous space, implicit time step variational inequality problem for the surface elevation is well-posed. This conjecture is supported both by physical arguments and numerical evidence. We then prove a general theorem which bounds the numerical error made by a finite element approximation of a nonlinear variational inequality in a Banach space. The bound is a sum of error terms of different types, essentially special to variational inequalities. In the case of the implicit step glacier problem these terms are of three types: errors from discretizing the bed elevation, errors from numerically solving for the Stokes velocity, and finally an expected quasi-optimal finite element error in the surface elevation itself.</description>

      <title>Quaternion tensor low rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approaches for low rank approximation of quaternion tensors \cite{chen2019low,zhang1997quaternions,hamilton1866elements}. The first method uses quasi-norms to approximate the tensor by a low-rank tensor using the QT-product \cite{miao2023quaternion}, which generalizes the known L-product to N-mode quaternions. The second method involves Non-Convex norms to approximate the Tucker and TT-rank for the completion problem. We demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively approximate the tensor compared to the convexifying of the rank, such as the nuclear norm. We provide theoretical results and numerical experiments to show the efficiency of the proposed methods in the Inpainting and Denoising applications.</description>

      <title>Well-balanced high order finite difference WENO schemes for a first-order Z4 formulation of the Einstein field equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we aim at developing a new class of high order accurate well-balanced finite difference (FD) Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) methods for numerical general relativity, which can be applied to any first-order reduction of the Einstein field equations, even if non-conservative terms are present. We choose the first-order non-conservative Z4 formulation of the Einstein equations, which has a built-in cleaning procedure that accounts for the Einstein constraints and that has already shown its ability in keeping stationary solutions stable over long timescales. Upon the introduction of auxiliary variables, the vacuum Einstein equations in first order form constitute a ...</description>
