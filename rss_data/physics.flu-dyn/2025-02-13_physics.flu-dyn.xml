      <title>Separation control applied to the turbulent flow around a NACA4412 wing section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out high-resolution large-eddy simulations (LESs) to investigate the effects of several separation-control approaches on a NACA4412 wing section with spanwise width of $L_z = 0.6$ at an angle of attack of $AoA=11^{\circ}$ {at} a Reynolds number of $Re_c = 200,000$ based on chord length $c$ and free-stream velocity $U_{\infty}$. Two control strategies were considered: (1) steady uniform blowing and/or suction on the suction and/or pressure sides, and (2) periodic control on the suction side. A wide range of control configurations were evaluated in terms of {aerodynamic efficiency (i.e., lift-to-drag ratio) and separation delay.} Uniform blowing and/or suction effectively delayed flow separation, leading to a lift increase of up to $11\%$, but yielded only marginal improvements in aerodynamic efficiency. In contrast, periodic control neither enhanced separation delay nor improved efficiency. A detailed analysis of the interaction between uniform blowing and/or suction and turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) over the wing was performed, including assessments of (1) integral boundary-layer quantities, (2) turbulence statistics, and (3) power-spectral densities. Significant modifications in Reynolds stresses and spectral characteristics were observed. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first numerical study utilizing high-resolution LESs to provide comprehensive assessments on separation control.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin for Porous Electrodes in Redox Flow Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous electrodes are a vital component of redox flow batteries, fuel cells and electrolyzers. We present a 3D digital twin for a porous electrode by direct numerical solution of the governing Navier-Stokes and Nernst-Planck equations for incompressible flow and electrochemical mass transport with Butler-Volmer reaction kinetics. We demonstrate our method by simulating a laboratory sized system at a sub-fiber scale of $1.25 {\mu}m$ using a single workstation. We establish convergence and the consistency of mesh refined lattices, and review an experimental validation of our model. We show the efficacy of two novel techniques to speed convergence to steady state, iterative upsampling and model refinement. We prove that the state of charge ($s$) at steady state can be formulated as the solution to a single PDE in $s$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition, and introduce a novel figure of merit $U_{\text{mt}}$, the utilization of an electrode geometry at the mass transport limit, both of which can be rapidly simulated with explicit methods from a given fluid velocity field. All of our code is highly performant, parallelizable, open source C++ that is published with this work and compatible with the largest modern scientific supercomputers available today.</description>

      <title>Role of phase distortion in nonlinear saturation of the unstable acoustic modes in hypersonic parallel flow boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the role of the relative phasing in the nonlinear saturation of the unstable Mack modes in a hypersonic parallel flow boundary layer in two dimensions (2D). As the linearly unstable Mack modes extract energy from the mean flow, the perturbation energy cascades into higher harmonics as well as the mean flow. The higher harmonics are generated with &lt; 0.5% of total perturbation energy at steady state, indicating a very small role of higher harmonics in 2D. Additionally, the higher harmonics propagate with the same phase speed as the unstable mode, indicating wave steepening and a coherent energy cascade. The mean flow gets decelerated and heated due to the continuous extraction of the perturbation energy into traveling modes and the viscous dissipation of these modes. Unlike unstable modes in classical hydrodynamics, we show that the distortion in relative phasing between the streamwise velocity and wall-normal velocity due to nonlinear distortion of the mean flow is dominant. Using asymptotic reconstruction of the unstable eigenmodes, we compute the perturbation energy budgets in the linear and nonlinear regimes. Through energy budgets, we show that the viscous effects in the wall layer and the viscous effects in the critical layer sufficiently capture the distortion in phase due to the mean-flow distortion. We then combine this in a numerical model for calculating the steady-state perturbation energy and mean-flow distortion through the nonlinear saturation of unstable Mack modes in a hypersonic parallel flow boundary layer in 2D. Throughout, we compare the results of approximate theoretical analysis with 2D direct numerical simulations (DNS).</description>

      <title>A numerical method for low Mach number compressible flows by simultaneous relaxation of dependent variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density varies spatiotemporally in low Mach number flows. Hence, incompressibility cannot be assumed, and the density must be accurately solved. Various methods have been proposed to analyze low Mach number flows, but their energy conservation properties have not been investigated in detail. This study proposes a new method for simultaneously relaxing velocity, pressure, density, and internal energy using a conservative finite difference scheme with excellent energy conservation properties to analyze low Mach number flows. In the analysis for sound wave propagation in an inviscid compressible flow, the amplitude amplification ratio and frequency of sound wave obtained by this numerical method agree well with the theoretical values. In the analysis for a three-dimensional periodic inviscid compressible flow, each total amount for the momentum, total energy, and entropy are discretely conserved. When no approximation, such as low Mach number approximations, is applied to the fundamental equations, the excellent conservation properties of momentum, total energy, and entropy are achieved. In decaying compressible isotropic turbulence, this computational method can capture turbulence fluctuations. Analyzing the Taylor-Green decaying vortex, we confirmed the validity of this computational scheme for compressible viscous flows. In the calculation for the natural convection in a cavity, the validity of this numerical method was presented even in incompressible flows considering density variation. In a three-dimensional Taylor decaying vortex problem, it was shown that this numerical method can accurately calculate incompressible flows. We clarified the accuracy and validity of the present numerical method by analyzing various flow models and demonstrated the possibility of applying this method to complex flow fields.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory based solutions for particle clustering in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic theory provides an elegant framework for studying dispersed particles in turbulent flows. Here the application of such probability density function (PDF)-based descriptions is considered in the context of particle clustering. The approach provides a continuum representation for the particle phase in which momentum conservation identifies two fundamental contributions to the particle mass flux. These take the form of an additional body force, which emerges from inhomogeneities in the sampling of turbulence by particles, and a component of the particle phase stress tensor associated with turbophoresis. Remarkably, these contributions are frequently overlooked in the specification of mean-field models for dispersed particle flows. To assess the relative importance of these mass flux contributions a kinematic simulation study has been performed, making use of a specially constructed inhomogeneous flow field designed to mimic the dynamics of particle pair behaviour. Whilst the turbophoretic contribution always acts to increase the clustering of particles, both the direction in which the additional body force acts and the relative importance of the two mass flux contributions are found to vary with particle inertia and turbulence intensity. In some regimes the body force is also the dominant mechanism responsible for particle clustering, demonstrating its importance within model formulations. It is further highlighted that the evolution of the radial distribution function which describes particle clustering is represented as a balance between convection and diffusion, and only inclusion of the identified mass flux contributions within this balance enables correct prediction of the particle pair concentration profile observed in simulations.</description>

      <title>Artificial and Eddy Viscosity in Large Eddy Simulation Part 1: Temporal and Spatial Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to quantify artificial dissipation in large eddy simulation. Here, artificial dissipation is defined as the residual of the discrete turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation. This method is applied to turbulent channel flow at Reynolds number 180 and 550 using a minimum-dissipation model within the OpenFOAM framework, employing both symmetry-preserving and standard OpenFOAM discretizations. Our analysis reveals that artificial viscosity can both produce and dissipate TKE. To quantify the interaction between sub-grid-scale model contributions and numerical error, we introduce viscous activity parameters, which also allow for evaluating the balance between molecular and non-molecular viscosity. Examining temporal discretization schemes, we find that all methods can deliver accurate flow predictions if an appropriate time step is used. For very small time steps, Forward-Euler is more efficient and accurate than Crank-Nicolson, though a better balance of accuracy and computational efficiency for larger time steps, making it preferable for large-scale applications. On collocated meshes, Van Kan's pressure correction method predicts better results than Chorin's. Our spatial discretization study shows that the symmetry-preserving scheme outperforms standard OpenFOAM schemes, as excessive artificial errors from spatial discretization can suppress the LES model. For the symmetry-preserving scheme, both eddy and artificial viscosities vary similarly, with eddy viscosity being dominant. The role of artificial viscosity changes with mesh refinement: on coarse meshes, it mainly dissipates TKE, while on finer meshes, it can produce TKE, counteracting eddy viscosity. The most accurate Reynolds shear stress predictions occur when non-molecular dissipation is nearly zero. For accurate mean flow kinetic energy, larger non-molecular dissipation is needed on finer meshes.</description>

      <title>Artificial and Eddy Viscosity in Large Eddy Simulation Part 2: Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part to our companion paper. The novel method to quantify artificial dissipation proposed in Part 1 is further applied in turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re_\tau}=180$ using various subgrid-scale models, with an emphasis on minimum-dissipation models (QR and AMD). We found that the amount of artificial viscosity is comparable to the eddy viscosity, but their distributions are essentially opposite. The artificial viscosity can either produce turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the near wall region or dissipate TKE in the bulk region. The eddy viscosity is almost uniformly distributed across the wall-normal direction and actively damps TKE at the channel center. An eddy viscosity level of $\nu_e/\nu &lt; 22\%$ leads to accurate predictions of flow quantities at the current mesh resolution. The optimal coefficients for the QR model combined with symmetry-preserving discretization were found to be C=0.092 for turbulent kinetic energy and C=0.012 for Reynolds stress terms and large scale motions. Adjusting the QR model coefficient changes the artificial viscosity and significantly impact turbulence characteristics: small-scale motions remain unaffected, while larger scales are less accurately captured with larger coefficients. For error quantification, the SGS activity parameter $\nu_{rel} = \frac{\nu_e}{\nu_e + \nu}$ helps relate and reflect the error magnitude with the SGS model. Optimal coefficients for the AMD model were also identified. The trends of varying the coefficient are similar to the QR model but differ in the amplitude of changes. The AMD model is more sensitive to the model coefficients and introduces more eddy viscosity in the near-wall region compared to the QR model. This research highlights the importance of balancing numerical and eddy viscosities for accurate LES predictions.</description>

      <title>A precise conformally mapped method for water waves in complex transient environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional water wave model based on conformal mapping is presented. The model is exact in the sense that it does not rely on truncated series expansions, nor suffer any numerical diffusion. Additionally, it is computationally highly efficient as it numerically evaluates only the surface line while using a fixed number of FFT operations per time step. A double layered mapping enforces prescribed outer boundaries without iteration. The model also supports transient boundaries, including walls. Mapping models are presented that support smooth bathymetries and angled overhanging geometries. An exact piston-type wavemaker model demonstrates the method's potential as a numerical wave tank. The model is tested and validated through a number of examples covering shallow water waves, wavemaker generation, rising bathymetry shelves, and wave reflection from slanting structures. A paddle-type wavemaker model, developed from the present theory, will be detailed in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Primary and secondary motions in an annular plane Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axisymmetric direct numerical simulations are carried out to study the hydrodynamics of a laminar, stationary, incompressible, Newtonian, single-phase flow in an Annular Plane Couette (APC) channel. This configuration is that of a Straight Plane Couette (SPC) flow but curved around itself to form an annulus. These simulations are validated by Particle Image Velocimetry measurements at different Reynolds numbers. The flow is analyzed using three dimensionless parameters: the channel aspect ratio $A_c$, which controls the effects of sidewall confinement, the channel curvature ratio $C_r$, which affects the centrifugal forces due to curvature, and the Reynolds number ${\rm Re}$. The rotation of the top annular plate generates a main flow in the azimuthal direction, while generating a secondary recirculation flow in the plane of the channel cross-section, due to the presence of a centrifugal force difference. As a result, the vertical profile of the azimuthal velocity deviates from the classical linear profile of the SPC flow, adopting an unexpected S-shape, similar to that observed in a turbulent plane Couette flow. Depending on the values of $A_c$ and $C_r$, the flow exhibits a wide range of behaviors, from a quasi-2D flow with a homogeneous shear rate at moderate ${\rm Re}$ with appropriate geometrical parameters ($A_c \gtrsim 5$, $C_r \lesssim 0.1$), to a complex 3D flow otherwise. Whereas it is laminar, the APC flow shares a strong analogy with a turbulent Taylor Couette (TC) flow. At large Reynolds numbers, the velocity gradients concentrate near the wall and the flow reaches an asymptotic regime where the torque scales as ${\rm Re}^\alpha$ and the flow structure becomes independent of ${\rm Re}$. Such properties make the APC flow an interesting configuration for fundamental investigations as a complement of the TC flow when shear and gravity are required to be in the same plane. In particular, it can be used to investigate the rheology of a dispersed two-phase mixture similarly to the work done by Yi et al. \cite{YI2021,Yi2022} in the TC device.</description>

      <title>Viscoplasticity can stabilise liquid collar motion on vertical cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid films coating vertical cylinders can form annular liquid collars which translate downwards under gravity. We investigate the dynamics of a thin viscoplastic liquid film coating the interior or exterior of a vertical cylindrical tube, quantifying how the yield stress modifies both the Rayleigh-Plateau instability leading to collar formation and the translation of collars down the tube. We use thin-film theory to derive an evolution equation for the layer thickness, which we solve numerically to determine the nonlinear dynamics of an initially flat layer. A flat layer is unstable to small disturbances in the free-surface height when gravity is sufficiently strong to make the fluid yield. We use matched asymptotics to derive a model describing the quasi-steady translation of a slender liquid collar when the Bond number is small. The structure of the asymptotic solution for a viscoplastic collar shares some features with the Newtonian version, but there are several novel asymptotic regions that emerge at the two ends of the collar. The global force balance, which determines the collar's speed, is modified by a leading-order contribution from viscous drag in the collar when the liquid is viscoplastic. We use the asymptotic model to describe slow changes in collar volume when the film thicknesses ahead of, and behind, the collar are unequal. When the film thickness ahead of the collar is less than a critical value that we determine, viscoplastic collars adjust their volume and reach a steadily-translating state. This contrasts with the Newtonian problem, where the only state in which steady translation occurs is unstable to small changes in the film thickness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have extended the radiation diffusion model of Hammer and Rosen to diverging spher- ical and cylindrical geometries. The effect of curvilinear geometry on the supersonic, expanding wavefront increases as the internal radius of a spherical or cylindrical shell ap- proaches zero. Small spherical geometries are important for modeling systems at the size scale of ICF capsules, at these scales existing quasi-analytic models for planar geometry significantly disagree with the results of simulation. With this method, the benefits of rapid iteration can be applied to common spherical systems at much smaller length scales. We present comparisons between numerical diffusion solutions and the analytic model to give ranges of applicability for the model.</description>

      <title>Learning Effective Dynamics across Spatio-Temporal Scales of Complex Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation of complex fluid flows with dynamics that span multiple spatio-temporal scales is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering domains. Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</description>

      <title>Finite difference alternative WENO schemes with Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decompositions for compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are widely used for hyperbolic conservation laws due to the ability to resolve discontinuities and maintain high-order accuracy in smooth regions at the same time. For hyperbolic systems, the WENO procedure is usually performed on local characteristic variables that are obtained by local characteristic decompositions to avoid oscillation near shocks. However, such decompositions are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we study a Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decomposition for the compressible Euler equations that reduces the cost. We apply the WENO procedure to the local characteristic fields of the Riemann invariants, where the eigenmatrix is sparse and thus the computational cost can be reduced. It is difficult to obtain the cell averages of Riemann invariants from those of the conserved variables due to the nonlinear relation between them, so we only focus on the finite difference alternative WENO versions. The efficiency and non-oscillatory property of the proposed schemes are well demonstrated by our numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified discussion of three types of near-spherical amoeboid microswimmers, driven by periodic, axially symmetric, achiral deformations (swim strokes): a solid deformable body, a vesicle with incompressible fluid membrane, and a droplet. Minimal models are used, which characterize the swimmer type only by boundary conditions. We calculate the swimming velocities, the dissipated power and the Lighthill efficiencies within a second order perturbation expansion in the small deformation amplitudes. %Our approach uses spherical harmonics to represent surface deformations and a system of general solutions of the Stokes equation based on vector spherical harmonics. For solid bodies, we reproduce older results by Lighthill and Blake, for vesicles and for droplets we add new results. The unified approach allows for a detailed comparison between the three types of microswimmers. We present such comparisons for swim strokes made up of spherical harmonics of adjacent orders $l$ and $l+1$, as well as for a manifold of swim strokes, made up of spherical harmonics up to order $l=4$, which respect volume- and surface-incompressibility. This manifold is two-dimensional, which allows to present swimming velocities and efficiencies in a compact graphical form. In a race in which each swimmer can choose the stroke that maximizes its speed, the droplet always comes in first, the vesicle comes in second, while the particle finishes third. However, if the three swimmers perform the same stroke, other order of rankings become possible. The maximum of the total efficiency of a droplet is greater than that of a vesicle if the internal dissipation is small. The efficiency of the solid body turns out to be typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that of vesicles and droplets. Optimizing the Lighthill efficiency and optimizing the swimming velocity result in different optimal swim strokes</description>

      <title>A Shifted Boundary Method for Thermal Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an incomplete Octree mesh implementation of the Shifted Boundary Method (Octree-SBM) for multiphysics simulations of coupled flow and heat transfer. Specifically, a semi-implicit formulation of the thermal Navier-Stokes equations is used to accelerate the simulations while maintaining accuracy. The SBM enables precise enforcement of field and derivative boundary conditions on cut (intercepted) elements, allowing for accurate flux calculations near complex geometries, when using non-boundary fitted meshes. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are implemented within the SBM framework, with results demonstrating that the SBM ensures precise enforcement of Neumann boundary conditions on Octree-based meshes. We illustrate this approach by simulating flows across different regimes, spanning several orders of magnitude in both the Rayleigh number ($Ra \sim 10^3$--$10^9$) and the Reynolds number ($Re \sim 10^0$--$10^4$), and covering the laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. Coupled thermal-flow phenomena and their statistics across all these regimes are accurately captured without any additional numerical treatments, beyond a Residual-based Variational Multiscale formulation (RB-VMS). This approach offers a reliable and efficient solution for complex geometries, boundary conditions and flow regimes in computational multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>DrivAerNet: A Parametric Car Dataset for Data-Driven Aerodynamic Design and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces DrivAerNet, a large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset of 3D industry-standard car shapes, and RegDGCNN, a dynamic graph convolutional neural network model, both aimed at aerodynamic car design through machine learning. DrivAerNet, with its 4000 detailed 3D car meshes using 0.5 million surface mesh faces and comprehensive aerodynamic performance data comprising of full 3D pressure, velocity fields, and wall-shear stresses, addresses the critical need for extensive datasets to train deep learning models in engineering applications. It is 60\% larger than the previously available largest public dataset of cars, and is the only open-source dataset that also models wheels and underbody. RegDGCNN leverages this large-scale dataset to provide high-precision drag estimates directly from 3D meshes, bypassing traditional limitations such as the need for 2D image rendering or Signed Distance Fields (SDF). By enabling fast drag estimation in seconds, RegDGCNN facilitates rapid aerodynamic assessments, offering a substantial leap towards integrating data-driven methods in automotive design. Together, DrivAerNet and RegDGCNN promise to accelerate the car design process and contribute to the development of more efficient cars. To lay the groundwork for future innovations in the field, the dataset and code used in our study are publicly accessible at https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/DrivAerNet.</description>

      <title>twoPhaseInterTrackFoam: an OpenFOAM module for Arbitrary Lagrangian/Eulerian Interface Tracking with Surfactants and Subgrid-Scale Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an implementation of the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian (ALE) Interface-Tracking method for simulating incompressible, immiscible two-phase flows as an OpenFOAM module. In addition to interface-tracking capabilities that include tracking of two fluid phases, an implementation of a Subgrid-Scale (SGS) modeling framework for increased accuracy when simulating sharp boundary layers is enclosed. The SGS modeling framework simplifies embedding subgrid-scale profiles into the unstructured Finite Volume discretization. Our design of the SGS model library significantly simplifies adding new SGS models and applying SGS modeling to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in OpenFOAM.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is a local well-posedness result in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. The time of existence that we obtain is uniform with respect to the size $\epsilon$ of the perturbation, and boils down to the large time $1/\epsilon$ with the assumptions of the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020. With additional assumptions, it is also uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>
