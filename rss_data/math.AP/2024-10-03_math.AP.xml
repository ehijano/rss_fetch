      <title>Global Stabilization for the BBM-KP equations on R2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present results on the energy decay of the BBM KP equations (I and II) posed on R2 with localized damping. This model offers an alternative to the KP equations, analogous to how the regularized long-wave equation relates to the classical Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation. We show that the energy associated with the Cauchy problem decays exponentially when a localized dissipative mechanism is present in a subdomain. Finally, we validate the theoretical results on the exponential stabilization of solutions to the BBM KP equations with damping through numerical experiments using a spectral finite difference scheme.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions for equivariant wave maps on a $2+1$ dimensional wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic magnetohydrodynamics system: cross and magnetic helicity in ideal case; non-uniqueness up to Lions' exponents from prescribed initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics system forced by random noise. First, for smooth solutions in the ideal case, the cross helicity remains invariant while the magnetic helicity precisely equals the initial magnetic helicity added by a linear temporal growth and multiplied by an exponential temporal growth respectively in the additive and the linear multiplicative case. We employ the technique of convex integration to construct an analytically weak and probabilistically strong solution such that, with positive probability, all of the total energy, cross helicity, and magnetic helicity more than double from initial time. Second, we consider the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics system forced by additive noise and diffused up to the Lions' exponent and employ convex integration with temporal intermittency to prove non-uniqueness of solutions starting from prescribed initial data.</description>

      <title>Stability of a class of supercritical volume-filling chemotaxis-fluid model near Couette flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a class of chemotaxis-fluid model incorporating a volume-filling effect in the sense of Painter and Hillen (Can. Appl. Math. Q. 2002; 10(4): 501-543), which is a supercritical parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system. As shown by Winkler et al., for any given mass, there exists a corresponding solution of the same mass that blows up in either finite or infinite time. In this paper, we investigate the stability properties of the two dimensional Patlak-Keller-Segel-type chemotaxis-fluid model near the Couette flow $ (Ay, 0) $ in $ \mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}, $ and show that the solutions are global in time as long as the initial cell mass $M&lt;\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}} $ and the shear flow is sufficiently strong ($A$ is large enough).</description>

      <title>Energy-Morawetz estimates for the wave equation in perturbations of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove energy and Morawetz estimates for solutions to the scalar wave equation in spacetimes with metrics that are perturbations, compatible with nonlinear applications, of Kerr metrics in the full subextremal range. Central to our approach is the proof of a global in time energy-Morawetz estimate conditional on a low frequency control of the solution using microlocal multipliers adapted to the $r$-foliation of the spacetime. This result constitutes a first step towards extending the current proof of Kerr stability in \cite{GCM1} \cite{GCM2} \cite{KS:Kerr} \cite{GKS} \cite{Shen}, valid in the slowly rotating case, to a complete resolution of the black hole stability conjecture, i.e., the statement that the Kerr family of spacetimes is nonlinearly stable for all subextremal angular momenta.</description>

      <title>A universal example for quantitative semi-uniform stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise quantitative semi-uniform stability for $C_0$-semigroups arising from port-Hamiltonian systems, complementing recent works on exponential and strong stability. With the result, we present a simple universal example class of port-Hamiltonian $C_0$-semigroups exhibiting arbitrary decay rates slower than $t^{-1/2}$. The latter is based on results from the theory of Diophantine approximation as the decay rates will be strongly related to approximation properties of irrational numbers by rationals given through cut-offs of continued fraction expansions.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures and their limiting behavior of the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation in unbounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence and limiting behavior of invariant measures of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation driven by linear multiplicative noise and additive noise defined in the entire space $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d=1,2$, which describes the phase spins in ferromagnetic materials around the Curie temperature. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions by a domain expansion method. We then prove the existence of invariant measures by the weak Feller argument. In the case $d=1$, we show the uniform tightness of the set of all invariant measures of the stochastic equation, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of the perturbed equation must be an invariant measure of the limiting system. The cut-off arguments, stopping time techniques and uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions are developed to overcome the difficulty caused by the high-order nonlinearity and the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings in unbounded domain.</description>

      <title>Exact boundary controllability of the 3D incompressible ideal MHD system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional ideal MHD system on a domain $\Omega' \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ with a part $\Gamma$ of the boundary~$\partial \Omega$, where we prescribe both $u\cdot n$ and $b\cdot n$, while $u\cdot n = b\cdot n =0$ on $\partial \Omega' \setminus \Gamma$. We prove the boundary controllability of the system, namely that we can prescribe the boundary data such that the unique solution of the system with initial state $(u_0,b_0)$ achieves another state $(u_1,b_1)$ in finite time, where $u_0,b_0,u_1,b_1$ are arbitrary divergence-free vector fields satisfying impermeability boundary condition which are extendable to vector fields with the same properties on any bounded domain obtained by extension of $\Omega'$ via $\Gamma$. As a byproduct, we give the first local well-posedness proof of incompressible, ideal MHD system, which does not use Elsasser variables and is thus applicable to any bounded domain with sufficient Sobolev regularity. We also provide a new and simple proof of the $2$D controllability.</description>

      <title>Fast-moving pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in an asymptotic model for the three-dimensional B\'enard-Marangoni problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation of planar patterns and fast-moving pattern interfaces in an asymptotic long-wave model for the three-dimensional B\'enard-Marangoni problem, which is close to a Turing instability. We derive the model from the full free-boundary B\'enard-Marangoni problem for a thin liquid film on a heated substrate of low thermal conductivity via a lubrication approximation. This yields a quasilinear, fully coupled, mixed-order degenerate-parabolic system for the film height and temperature. As the Marangoni number $M$ increases beyond a critical value $M^*$, the pure conduction state destabilises via a Turing(-Hopf) instability. Close to this critical value, we formally derive a system of amplitude equations which govern the slow modulation dynamics of square or hexagonal patterns. Using center manifold theory, we then study the bifurcation of square and hexagonal planar patterns. Finally, we construct planar fast-moving modulating travelling front solutions that model the transition between two planar patterns. The proof uses a spatial dynamics formulation and a center manifold reduction to a finite-dimensional invariant manifold, where modulating fronts appear as heteroclinic orbits. These modulating fronts facilitate a possible mechanism for pattern formation, as previously observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>The helicity distribution for the incompressible Euler equations on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the helicity associated to solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. We show that under mild conditions on the regularity of the velocity field of an incompressible ideal fluid it is possible to define a defect distribution describing the local helicity balance. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we also provide the global helicity balance on bounded domains in terms of the boundary contributions of the vorticity, velocity and pressure.</description>

      <title>First-order empirical interpolation method for real-time solution of parametric time-dependent nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model reduction approach for the real-time solution of time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with parametric dependencies. The approach integrates several ingredients to develop efficient and accurate reduced-order models. Proper orthogonal decomposition is used to construct a reduced-basis (RB) space which provides a rapidly convergent approximation of the parametric solution manifold. The Galerkin projection is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by projecting the weak formulation of the governing PDEs onto the RB space. A major challenge in model reduction for nonlinear PDEs is the efficient treatment of nonlinear terms, which we address by unifying the implementation of several hyperreduction methods. We introduce a first-order empirical interpolation method to approximate the nonlinear terms and recover the computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through its application to the Allen-Cahn equation, which models phase separation processes, and the Buckley-Leverett equation, which describes two-phase fluid flow in porous media. Numerical results highlight the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>High-order empirical interpolation methods for real time solution of parametrized nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel model reduction methods for rapid solution of parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in real-time or many-query contexts. Our approach combines reduced basis (RB) space for rapidly convergent approximation of the parametric solution manifold, Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs onto the RB space for dimensionality reduction, and high-order empirical interpolation for efficient treatment of the nonlinear terms. We propose a class of high-order empirical interpolation methods to derive basis functions and interpolation points by using high-order partial derivatives of the nonlinear terms. As these methods can generate high-quality basis functions and interpolation points from a snapshot set of full-order model (FOM) solutions, they significantly improve the approximation accuracy. We develop effective a posteriori estimator to quantify the interpolation errors and construct a parameter sample via greedy sampling. Furthermore, we implement two hyperreduction schemes to construct efficient reduced-order models: one that applies the empirical interpolation before Newton's method and another after. The latter scheme shows flexibility in controlling hyperreduction errors. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Small-time controllability on the group of diffeomorphisms for Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a link between the small-time approximate controllability of bilinear Schr\"odinger PDEs (posed on a boundaryless Riemannian manifold $M$) and the control in the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ of the diffeomorphisms, isotopic to the identity and with compact support, of the underlying manifold $M$.
  More precisely, under a density assumption on the Lie algebra generated by the control potential and the Laplacian, we show that compositions $|J_P|^{1/2}(\psi_0\circ P)$ of the initial wavefunction $\psi_0\in L^2(M,\mathbb{C})$ with any diffeomorphism $P\in{\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ can be approximately reached, in arbitrarily small times, by controlled solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation (here, $|J_P|$ denotes the determinant of the Jacobian of $P$). We illustrate this property on two examples, posed respectively on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ and on the euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  As a physical application, we obtain in particular the small-time approximate control of the quantum particle's averaged positions. This yields also new small-time approximate controllability properties between families of eigenstates on $\mathbb{T}^d$.
  To prove the result, we first construct solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation that approximately evolve, arbitrarily fast, along any unitary transport flow on $L^2(M,\mathbb{C})$. In this way, we control the composition with any diffeomorphism that can be decomposed as a product of flows on $M$. We then combine this property with a result of Thurston on the simplicity of the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ to conclude.</description>

      <title>Free Stein Kernel and Moments maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a free analogue to Fathi's construction of Stein kernels using moment maps (2019). This is possible for a class of measures called free moment measures, introduced in the free case by Bahr and Boschert, by using the notion of free moment maps which areconvex function solutions of a variant of the free Monge-Ampere equation discovered by Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko. We then show how regularity estimates in some weighted non-commutative Sobolev spaces on these maps control the transport distances to the semicircular law. We also prove in the one-dimensional case a free analogue of the moment map version of the Cafarelli contraction theorem (2001), discovered by Klartag (2014) in the classical case, and which leads to a uniform bound for the free moment Stein kernel. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results: we prove a stability result characterising the semicircular distribution among a certain subclass of free Gibbs measures, the probabilistic interpretation of this free moment Stein kernel in terms of free diffusion processes, and its connections with the theory of non-commutative Dirichlet forms.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot model and its applications to tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot model with respect to its mathematical well-posedness. The system models flow through deformable porous media in which the solid material has two phases with distinct material properties. The two phases of the porous material evolve according to a generalized Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, with additional influence from both viscoelastic and fluid effects. The flow-deformation coupling in the system is governed by Biot's theory. This results in a three-way coupled system that can be viewed as an extension of the Cahn-Larche equations by adding a fluid flowing through the medium. We distinguish the cases between a spatially dependent and a state-dependent Biot-Willis function. In the latter case, we consider a regularized system. In both cases, we use a Galerkin approximation to discretize the system and derive suitable energy estimates. Moreover, we apply compactness methods to pass to the limit in the discretized system. In the case of Vegard's law and homogeneous elasticity, we show that the weak solution depends continuously on the data and is unique. Lastly, we present some numerical simulations to highlight the features of the system as a tumor growth model.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for the three dimensional Maxwell-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we prove global well-posedness for the massive Maxwell-Dirac system in the Lorenz gauge in $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, for small, sufficiently smooth and decaying initial data, as well as modified scattering for the solutions. Heuristically we exploit the close connection between the massive Maxwell-Dirac and the wave-Klein-Gordon equations, while developing a novel approach which applies directly at the level of the Dirac equations. The modified scattering result follows from a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions inside the light cone, which we derive via the method of testing with wave packets of Ifrim-Tataru.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of multisoliton solutions of the gravitational Hartree equation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of multisoliton solutions of the three-dimensional gravitational Hartree equation whose trajectories follow many body dynamics of hyperbolic, parabolic or hyperbolic-parabolic types. The existence of such dynamics was recently proved by Polimeni-Terracini. We also prove the orbital stability of multisolitons whose minimal distance between centers grows linearly in time, with the hyperbolic type as a special case. This work generalizes and improves the result of Krieger-Martel-Rapha\"el on two-soliton solutions, and resolves a question posed in their paper.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness and scattering theory of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01174v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel first-order derivative for functions on a lattice graph, which extends the discrete Laplacian and generalizes the theory of discrete PDEs on the lattices. First, we establish the well-posedness of generalized quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations and give a new proof of the global well-posedness of semilinear Schr\"odinger equations. Then we provide explicit expressions of higher order derivatives of the solution map and prove the analytic dependence between solution and initial data. At the end, we show the existence of wave operator and prove the asymptotic completeness for solutions with small data.</description>

      <title>The influence of advection on the propagation phenomena of reaction-diffusion equations with KPP-bistable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to propagation phenomena for a reaction-diffusion-advection equation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous environment, where heterogeneity is reflected by the nonlinearity term -- being KPP type on $(-\infty, -L]$ and being bistable type on $[L,+\infty)$ for some $L&gt;0$. A comprehensive analysis is presented on the influence of advection and heterogeneous reactions, based on various values of the advection rate $c$. Denote by $c_m$ and $c_b$ the spreading speeds of KPP and bistable reactions, respectively. When $c&gt;-c_m$, it is shown that propagation can always occur with leftward spreading speed $c_m+c$ and rightward spreading speed $\min\big(\max(c_b-c,0),c_m-c\big)$. Moreover, a logarithmic delay of the level sets in the left direction is discovered. When $c \le -c_m$, propagation phenomena are determined by the initial data and by the sign of $c_b$. In particular, when $c_b&gt;0$, the leftward propagation speed is $c_b+c$ if the initial population is "large enough"; whereas extinction occurs if the initial value is located in the bistable region and is "relatively small". In addition, the attractiveness of the bistable traveling wave is obtained when the leftward spreading speed is $c_b+c$ and/or when the rightward spreading speed is $c_b-c$.</description>

      <title>The $L_{p}$-Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for variational functionals with $0\leq p&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infinitesimal forms of the $L_{p}$-Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for variational functionals, such as the $q$-capacity, torsional rigidity, and the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator, are investigated for $p \geq 0$. These formulations yield Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities related to these functionals. As an application, the $L_{p}$-Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for torsional rigidity with $0 \leq p &lt; 1$ are confirmed for small $C^{2}$-perturbations of the unit ball.</description>

      <title>Radial blow-up standing solutions for the semilinear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear wave equation with a power nonlinearity in the radial case. Given $r_0&gt;0$, we construct a blow-up solution such that the solution near $(r_0,T(r_0))$ converges exponentially to a soliton. Moreover, we show that $r_0$ is a non-characteristic point. For that, we translate the question in self-similar variables and use a modulation technique. We will also use energy estimates from the one dimensional case treated by Merle and Zaag. Of course because of the radial setting, we have an additional gradient term which is delicate to handle. That's precisely the purpose of our paper.</description>

      <title>Convexity and rigidity of hypersurfaces in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds $M^n$, $n\geq 3$, closed infinitesimally convex hypersurfaces $\Gamma$ bound convex flat regions, if curvature of $M^n$ vanishes on tangent planes of $\Gamma$. This encompasses Chern-Lashof-Sacksteder characterization of compact convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, and some results of Greene-Wu-Gromov on rigidity of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. It follows that closed simply connected surfaces in $M^3$ with minimal total absolute curvature bound Euclidean convex bodies, as stated by M. Gromov in 1985. The proofs employ the Gauss-Codazzi equations, a generalization of Schur comparison theorem to CAT($k$) spaces, and other techniques from Alexandrov geometry outlined by A. Petrunin.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating semilinear heat equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearities in $L^p$-sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that multilevel Picard approximations are capable of approximating solutions of semilinear heat equations in $L^{p}$-sense, ${p}\in [2,\infty)$, in the case of gradient-dependent, Lipschitz-continuous nonlinearities, in the sense that the computational effort of the multilevel Picard approximations grow at most polynomially in both the dimension $d$ and the reciprocal $1/\epsilon$ of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$.</description>
