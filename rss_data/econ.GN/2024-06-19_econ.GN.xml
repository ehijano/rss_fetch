      <title>Research on Trends in Illegal Wildlife Trade based on Comprehensive Growth Dynamic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Comprehensive Growth Dynamic Model (CGDM). CGDM is designed to simulate the temporal evolution of an event, incorporating economic and social factors. CGDM is a regression of logistic regression, power law regression, and Gaussian perturbation term. CGDM is comprised of logistic regression, power law regression, and Gaussian perturbation term. CGDM can effectively forecast the temporal evolution of an event, incorporating economic and social factors. The illicit trade in wildlife has a deleterious impact on the ecological environment. In this paper, we employ CGDM to forecast the trajectory of illegal wildlife trade from 2024 to 2034 in China. The mean square error is utilized as the loss function. The model illuminates the future trajectory of illegal wildlife trade, with a minimum point occurring in 2027 and a maximum point occurring in 2029. The stability of contemporary society can be inferred. CGDM's robust and generalizable nature is also evident.</description>

      <title>Big data in economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around 2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics, engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones, social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index, population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast and with reduced costs.</description>

      <title>DAOs' Business Value from an Open Systems Perspective: A Best-Fit Framework Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are emerging innovative organizational structures, enabling collective coordination, and reshaping digital collaboration. Despite the promising and transformative characteristics of DAOs, the potential technological advancements and the understanding of the business value that organizations derive from implementing DAO characteristics are limited. This research applies a systematic review of DAOs' business applicability from an open systems perspective following a best-fit framework methodology. Within our approach, combining both framework and thematic analysis, we discuss how the open business principles apply to DAOs and present a new DAO business framework comprising of four core business elements: i) token, ii) transactions, iii) value system and iv) strategy with their corresponding sub-characteristics. This paper offers a preliminary DAO business framework that enhances the understanding of DAOs' transformative potential and guides organizations in innovating more inclusive business models (BMs), while also providing a theoretical foundation for researchers to build upon.</description>

      <title>Retractions: Updating from Complex Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modify a canonical experimental design to identify the effectiveness of retractions. Comparing beliefs after retractions to beliefs (a) without the retracted information and (b) after equivalent new information, we find that retractions result in diminished belief updating in both cases. We propose this reflects updating from retractions being more complex, and our analysis supports this: we find longer response times, lower accuracy, and higher variability. The results -- robust across diverse subject groups and design variations -- enhance our understanding of belief updating and offer insights into addressing misinformation.</description>

      <title>Rankings-Dependent Preferences: A Real Goods Matching Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether preferences for objects received via a matching mechanism are influenced by how highly agents rank them in their reported rank order list. We hypothesize that all else equal, agents receive greater utility for the same object when they rank it higher. The addition of rankings-dependent utility implies that it may not be a dominant strategy to submit truthful preferences to a strategyproof mechanism, and that non-strategyproof mechanisms that give more agents objects they \emph{report} as higher ranked may increase market welfare. We test these hypotheses with a matching experiment in a strategyproof mechanism, the random serial dictatorship, and a non-strategyproof mechanism, the Boston mechanism. A novel feature of our experimental design is that the objects allocated in the matching markets are real goods, which allows us to directly measure rankings-dependence by eliciting values for goods both inside and outside of the mechanism. The experimental results are mixed, with stronger evidence for rankings-dependence in the RSD treatment than the Boston treatment. We find no differences between the two mechanisms for the rates of truth-telling and the final welfare.</description>
